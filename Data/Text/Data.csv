hm6xs7r,firehydrant_man,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,I dont  trust you but you should trust me   _proceeds to not trust him because trust is a 2 way street_   see I was right not to trust you
hm80jzc,doglop,11/26/2021,1,7.0,Imo is as easy as does the enemy has summoners? Then kill them withoit hesitating doesnt matter if the supp get the kill. They dont? Then try to leave the kill to the adc
hm7tmu4,J539,11/26/2021,1,252.0,Oh didn’t know :( Isn’t it possible to just set up some infrastructure there or is it that costly ?
hm7pe8q,Zuldak,11/26/2021,1,,How would they force him to stay? You cant imprison him and force him onto the stage.
hm7aw8p,AnxiousEzrael,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,I mean if 3 of his teammates were in the dark and not given even a cursory explanation its definitely on Yamato and the management.  They dont have to give them all the info (or us). They had to placate them in some way. Upset deserves his privacy but as DL said you dont get to have that when youre a public figure
hm7kn51,Halseyqueen,11/26/2021,1,58.0,Ill make sure of it for next time ) ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)
hm8h6i5,Odd_Play_5769,11/26/2021,1,2.0,Smoke one
hm7g4yu,traumatized_for_life,11/26/2021,1,100.0,it is canon. arcane is retconning leagues lore and its for the better. leagues original lore was made by sweaty white nerds who took inspiration from other sweaty white nerds so you have this ridiculous foundation that lacks deprh diversity and substance.  caitlyn has half-ionian heritage now and looks less like a british carnival prostitute. Jayce looks hispanic now instead of generic white techno superman.
hm89c9h,willham52,11/26/2021,1,16.0,What a joke of an org
hm8o0tc,Waskitoo,11/26/2021,1,4.0,heres another video from 2019   def a dunkey knockoff   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jR1rHNd6Fmc
hm75fau,nncoma,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,People at Latin American are laughing at this situation. Everyone knows what kind of person she is

hm7gz54,traumatized_for_life,11/26/2021,1,100.0,vi 17 act 1 21-22 act 2 same with cait Jinx 12 act 1 16-17 act 2 ekko 11-12 act 1 15-17 act 2 Jayce 24 act 1 28-29 act 2
hm834za,DHSUAUGEV,11/26/2021,1,60.0,Ok then lets compare op.ggs. so I can clown on you
hm7e63j,rekscoper2,11/26/2021,1,9.0,I dont
hm7vgxo,MapPotential9009,11/26/2021,1,243.0,Sad but true. Ivern isnt an assassin therefore hes very low on Riots priority list. More sexy skins for Ahri come before fixing niche picks like Ivern.
hm73ygl,polacs,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,I get your point but kicking Upset is not that easy. If fnatic kicks upset in 2 seconds G2 firms Upset
hm7fy6x,Potkrokin,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,I mean I guess they’re allowed to but I also think those people are kind of huge assholes.  Nobody gives up their chance to go to worlds if it isn’t incredibly important. Why the fuck should the assumption be that he’s a weasel unless you’re an asshole?
hm8mjgs,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,140.0,In toplane I really learned the importance of trading and matchups in general even when playing other roles. Since youre put onto an island you really need to minmax to have an impact later but its really applicable to other roles. In jungle you learn to look at lanes a lot more. Midlane is just jack of all trades role. Ad you learn to get the most amount of gold. Support you learn how to support. I think what improved me the most when playing midlane was definitely playing toplane. Since you learn almost every role from playing mid in some sort of way given you play x champion the only real thing is getting better at trading imo.
hm7knml,De-Lit,11/26/2021,1,13.0,Because most people are brain dead. There are times to take and times to leave it for wave management and 99% of people think its always the wrong time
hm7tsvb,Poughy14,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Its not that hard this management is just terrible.   How hard is it to say he has to leave because of family medical condition/death he ask you to support him in this time and he ask us to remain private about this and to not be asked furthermore   Take 5 min its the f minimum for your teammates and I insist teammates not coworkers
hm7g5bz,Rektile7,11/26/2021,1,1301.0,They had Upset/Hyli in spring as well and it amounted to fuck all. He was the best player on the team but he wasnt getting there without Bwipo Adam and Nisqy stepping up
hm7tk9c,internetuser25,11/26/2021,1,120.0,Im partial to firehouse subs especially when compared against subway
hm7wydz,Sirouz,11/26/2021,1,277.0,I’ve been hoping/praying for a re-merge for so many years :/ I got friends on both would be lovely to be able to play with them all on my main account.
hm7mw51,OfficerSmiles,11/26/2021,1,540.0,you are like the fourth person to make this shitty ass joke
hm7875x,TheOnlyFallenCookie,11/26/2021,1,92.0,how do you acess the rebuild missions?
hm7fify,--------V--------,11/26/2021,1,74.0,I don’t know? What makes me think he wanted to play? He won’t even tell his teammates what happened so I sincerely question his drive. Hope his girlfriend of 2 months turned wife is worth it.
hm7glbu,GiannisisMVP,11/26/2021,1,1301.0,You can literally play league in the hospital I remember playing arams with Hai when he was grabbing random people from chat after his collapsed lung.
hm71ckk,Quazz,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Dunno if someone says they have some serious family shit going on then I dont really understand how you can feel in the dark.
hm7itih,Zeddit_B,11/26/2021,1,198.0,Stream list game 1 (mobile formatting is too hard for me apparently):  twitch.tv/srtty_lol (no recent stream)  twitch.tv/Dhokla (no recent stream)  twitch.tv/rjsmid  twitch.tv/spicalol  twitch.tv/EG_Danny  twitch.tv/tactical  twitch.tv/Zeyzal  twitch.tv/corejj   Cast: twitch.tv/captainflowers22
hm7u7ij,Eecka,11/26/2021,1,90.0,In terms of winrate predator is at 44.6% with 1k games played.   Electrocute is 48.9% with 28k games played.   First Strike is 49.9% with 7k games played.  So not her best rune at all in terms of winrates at least
hm6yamx,throwawaynumber116,11/26/2021,1,16.0,Go sticks and make it a horror movie >:)
hm8rlop,Pure_Void,11/26/2021,1,102.0,yea all of the skins legit looks amazing definitely the best world skins its gonna be hard to top them. I have LeBlanc and camille ive gotten rakan shard like 3 times but i dont play supp but i want the rest though
hm7anmr,Suspicious-Bus6351,11/26/2021,1,84.0,People dont understand what flame horizon as a term really means. When people were using that term originally it was to talk about how Flame from CG Entus Blaze would literally get a 100 CS difference in lane against people. I dont really understand why people use this term still since 100 CS differences in lane pretty much never happen anymore.

hm8d1u9,Steak-Complex,11/26/2021,1,4.0,this is a bug. camille r extends yones e duration. he just straight ignored you.
hm82h23,LazerFruit,11/26/2021,1,7.0,Ideally ziggs should but its much better for the supp to get it then it is to try and gift it and pantheon walk away
hm7osms,ShibbiesClimax,11/26/2021,1,3.0,How would you change it? People go bot because bot laners are lower level and getting your main source of damage ahead or their main source of damage behind is obviously good
hm78gtf,Falsus,11/26/2021,1,141.0,Funny fact I get 20 more ping from the EU North & East server from the *Nordics* than I do from the EU West server even though EUNE is the advertised server for me.

hm7baub,SnooChickens7571,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,What does that have to do with emphaty he jst wants the best team possible.
hm7eouw,Arcadis,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,How to say you are an ignorant fuck by actually saying you are an ignorant fuck. NA servers not fucking SPEAK WHITE servers french Canadians ARE NA lol gtfo with your racist rant
hm6yfhi,Lceus,11/26/2021,1,43.0,> But Council voted on giving undercity to him so he made that deal even without giving up Jinx.   Part of what they voted on was for Silco to give over Jinx. That was part of Jayces terms.  Now whether they could come to an agreement that did not involve handing over Jinx thats debatable.
hm86rql,xKayko,11/26/2021,1,143.0,No youre just ill
hm7viqk,MyroVeinz,11/26/2021,1,17.0,Eh not impressive
hm7ssej,Acegickmo,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,he says (according to the translation) that real women stop pretending implying women like her lie just to manipulate their boyfriends. No one says this about men hence sexism.  The tweet this is replying to is also playing he is simping for her implying more manipulation. Its all based on nothing but sexism
hm7m2c0,Slargo,11/26/2021,1,151.0,wings bass is too good.
hm7483r,Aparter,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,Yes hypocrisy in the thread is unreal
hm86qc9,LelouchtheGreat,11/26/2021,1,159.0,This is the first thing everyone says but i have watched my replays multiple times when it happens and there is nothing that would
hm7dty5,Reddit12btw,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,So you dont understand how real life works and that if one of the things mentioned above happened to her she would be in a hospital at the time?  I mean you have fnc flair i assume youre room temp iq.
hm74biq,ApplePitou,11/26/2021,1,4.0,Sorry but its not up to me :3

hm79jjh,CastieIsTrenchcoat,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,Yeah but all their comments in this thread are hilarious.
hm7fi4u,mrmorzan,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,well someone fucked up communication and it was either upset management or both.  The fact that he was asked about replacements should at the very least have have been kept confidential. Anyone should be able to see the optics are absolutely terrible.   Adam is being childish doesnt mean upset and management are off the hook.
hm7clcw,MoonSt0n3,11/26/2021,1,3.0,Oh my god it happened again with another match which was \~68 minutes long. Somehow matches longer than 50 minutes keep getting erased from history.
hm7jjyt,CGisaMasterMind,11/26/2021,1,150.0,Decent Top Xmithie Jensen DL Decent support  This roster would be better than half the LCS teams
hm7noor,DT-Z0mby,11/26/2021,1,144.0,just install the minimap dlc duh
hm79l8l,Saffy_88,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,Well said
hm8gd1c,hiccup333,11/26/2021,1,12346.0,Totally agree.  No resolution
hm7ikch,tbr1cks,11/26/2021,1,97.0,Kinda fitting GenG will keep losing and choking
hm71zpy,KennebecLyman,11/26/2021,1,108.0,He should become a redditor and instantly become master rank
hm8oi7t,bburgers9,11/26/2021,1,13.0,If youre going to upvote or downvote at least read the post first. If youre going to comment leave something constructive.
hm7l4x6,Rikkimaaruu,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,The France vs. Germany feud is still kicking online as it is tradition.  Yeah i dont know for sure but i heard that it is more difficult for a native french speaker to learn english as an adult. But i havent digged deeper on that topic so it could be something else.  Also i met a few realy cool french guys online who put alot of effort into at least trying to communicate.
hm7v2kh,lust-boy,11/26/2021,1,24.0,wow good flair     would love a dinosaur champ in league      to bad reksai was the last good monster champ n were only getting anime and chibi mobile game characters from now on
hm8u1ku,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,182.0,um.
hm7lpri,Unnomable,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,I agree with you being shown this response from Adam and Bwipo probably means Upset was right not to trust them its just difficult to say with certainty.   Either way the choice entirely belongs to Upset whether people believe he is justified or not. I dont think that knowing the reason would have changed anything really and attacking Upset / his family is a shitty thing to do anyways.
hm71wuh,Dry-Place-2986,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Take a look at [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fnatic/comments/q9ji9l/upset_playing_soloq/). Not that this justifies anything. I dont know why Redditors want people to be miserable. Just because something terrible happens in your life doesnt mean you should drop everything to cry and grieve. In fact its great to have stuff like video games as a coping mechanism during trying times.
hm763d9,DT-Z0mby,11/26/2021,1,79.0,and winning or losing hard means it cant be played well? wtf is that logic
hm7o80v,ACertainUser123,11/26/2021,1,,Isnt that the same thing? He was approached by Fnatic and advised them they should get alphari? So he wanted to replace Adam.
hm7l4s4,KeijiKiryira,11/26/2021,1,5.0,If you’re super far ahead and are unable to only push one lane putting more pressure on the enemy by destroying multiple lanes is useful. But if you’re unable to push your lane and are ahead moving to mid/top and getting those turrets usually helps because then bot lane may be empty allowing that to be pushed if there aren’t any large fights to join in.
hm7svm1,Coc0tte,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Youre saying that like Upset didnt commit years of his own life to the game and the competition and like he didnt work very hard during this whole year. And you almost make it sounds like he left on purpose and without consequences for himself.  If he left its because he had good reasons to and even Yamato was concerned about Upsets situation when he learned what happened. Upset was certainly devastated by the situation but yet people still blame him and harrass him non-stop. It was never the fault of Upset that things happened to his family why would people blame him ? Why cant people respect his privacy especially since he shared the details of the situation to the team management ? Its very clear that he would not have left if it was not a VERY serious issue.  And he is right to not trust his teammates about keeping his privacy secret it would definitely have been leaked to the public eventually (especially when you see Adam posting random shit to create drama) so I totally understand his decision to hide the details to his teammates.  People should just stop being assholes and treat him like a human being accepting that family issues can happen and that people are not required to share their private life.
hm75f8i,Motor-Mathematician3,11/26/2021,1,83.0,True shouldnt have expected more than a clueless redditor giving his opinions on things he doesnt know anything about
hm7d5x4,Kekluldab,11/26/2021,1,193.0,He probably talking about the one with  moe Sanch and bio. But even then dl was trying to hard to keep them in the game to
hm741fk,Drathmar,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,He told them it was a serious family situation. If that wasnt enough for them that kn them not him and shows the trust want there not just from upset to them but them to upset as well.
hm70zh8,Chilley317,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Idk why you question that. Some random dude on Reddit said it it 100% happened
hm72x47,Agreeable_Junket_271,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,A close one is in urgent trouble - Reveals 0 information that is harmful to anyone involveds privacy or reputation while conveying how serious of a situation it is.  Basically any situation can be conveyed in such a way that respects Upsets privacy and sensitivity of his issue and in addition respects the teammates sacrifice on his behalf
hm8o90x,doglop,11/26/2021,1,8.0,I know it was on reddit but I dont have it saved
hm7v641,adric03,11/26/2021,1,1.0,till 5 min more precisely
hm78n4v,yawnbaby,11/26/2021,1,46.0,Youre really judgmental. Im just interested in Arcane and here you are trying to dissect me as a human being.  I dont know what your perspective is because you wont tell me. I thought I mentioned that in my last comment? I just want to talk about Jinx and the lore. Im not here to jerk myself off or for a feel-good high. I dont need reddit to raise my confidence in fact commenting on things is something I rarely do especially if its opinion based. This interaction with you doesnt upset me its just exhausting because I thought Id be able to see your points of view on the subject. I thought Id have a debate of sustenance one that can open my mind to different ways of looking at Jinx. Instead youve taken severe offense to my choice in vocabulary and refuse to talk of nothing but that.  I dont know what you think nor am I trying to assume. Its the very reason why I asked in my first comment to which you failed to answer. I dont feel superior its a fucking comment on Reddit. How does anyone feel superior? I dont know where you pulled out all these assumptions but youre dead wrong. Your negative outlook on my character has robbed us of talking about anything that matters.  Im simply a girl who fucking loves Arcane and I dont give a shit about trying to feel superior or whatever twisted shit reddit people get high off of. You havent offered me anything about that matter and this discussion has turned from one of promise to a tedious repetitive carrousel. It feels like Im talking to a brick wall that thinks Im an enemy out to get them.
hm7eaz8,GiannisisMVP,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,True its very likely Adam has torpedoed his own  future I certainly wouldnt want to be on a team with him.
hm7grwg,BigB_porter,11/26/2021,1,10.0,Or you could just ignore them they want reactions from people so them being told they are muted one will make them annoying to other people and two make them know they got under your skin
hm7sna2,leagueoflegendsdog,11/26/2021,1,252.0,Aw... Do your feelings get hurt by what people think?
hm7oi65,omegaxend,11/26/2021,1,24.0,NEW MUNDO CANISTERS AND ULT IS SHIMMER OR AT LEAST A VERSION OF IT
hm75eq6,Miyaor,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Okay and he doesnt deserve forgiveness. They are completely in their right to hate him for ditching them without an explanation.
hm71vkr,robogloop,11/26/2021,1,141.0,nice essay but idgaf
hm6ybou,NeonGIGA,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Just because something terrible has happened doesnt mean you have to spend every waking second not playing league or focusing on the situation at hand honestly had he not touched league people would still be critical and theyd probably call him lazy for not playing a second of league whatsoever.
hm7ismk,Brief-Assistant-2772,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,I am just baffled how poor Upset’s communication skill even was. I just can’t comprehend how the meeting before the world went to lead to his teammates being so “upset” with him.
hm6zei9,DragonApps,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,I love Adam? Fuck off with that. Idc about Fnatic or any of its players but if there isn’t a single person on that roster coach or otherwise coming forward to defend Upset then you can tell that Upset is in the wrong. But Upset had the most recent twitlonger so he has to be in the right right?

hm7srpt,TheDiabeticGM,11/26/2021,1,68.0,I dont know anything about League so hearing this actually makes me even more excited for Arcane. A lot of people have been pointing out that OBVIOUSLY the Champions arent goint to die they cant! But then again.... if time is not what it appears in this alternate dimension well. Super stoked now. Thanks everybody!
hm8k8br,pr3d4tr,11/26/2021,1,12.0,Wow that last backdoor was pretty cool.
hm8675x,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,92.0,If I were to do this again I think my highest win rates to masters would be in that order. Jungle was definitely my most played role but is inflated in games since it was originally an account I played on to warm up on/have fun after a long day (150 games of having fun on kayn).   For my climb to challenger I know support will be my highest w/r role since I also feel its the role that functions most like midlane in a way.
hm6zuh9,bondsmatthew,11/26/2021,1,144.0,Auto attack more! I see it especially from supports in trades. It can be the difference between a lot trade and a won trade. Go to poke an enemy in lane as Zyra for example? Throw down a W Q auto instead of just a W Q. Midlane as Ahri? Throw an auto in with your Q to add 60 extra damage. Just because youre an AP champion doesnt mean your autos do 0 damage
hm8mytn,Ciscodiscoisvibing,11/26/2021,1,8.0,when im last pick playing support i sometimes ask my toplaner who they want me to ban since i know mathcups are so much more relevant in there  im not sure if it helps that much but its atleast something.
hm7w9ll,PankoKing,11/26/2021,1,,Yeah and what additional information was given?
hm7rtjh,Jiffyyy,11/26/2021,1,124.0,you should be a detective.
hm7afr1,Btigeriz,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,The guys who got him there is the most bullshit thing I have heard so far. As if Upset/Hyli wasnt the best botlane in the west. They got there as a team but without Upset I highly doubt they would have gotten as far as they did in playoffs. Nice way to diminish Upsets role to the point you make it sound like he got carried there.
hm8a8em,Oribeau,11/26/2021,1,3.0,Little teaser for TSM Legends
hm83qy7,External-Example-292,11/26/2021,1,175.0,wow so amazing <3
hm6zn0a,TuffPeen,11/26/2021,1,144.0,YO WHAT
hm8gux5,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,118.0,well just looking at your recent opgg it looks like youre smurfing it up. Just keep doing what youre doing. Most of the time people have low cs/min and even though theyre mechanically good they cant carry games because they just dont have the items.
hm8tq0f,MI8MarkusXx,11/26/2021,1,10.0,Sadly they got backdoored and lost
hm7pqdg,jaguar317,11/26/2021,1,,Confused why you think Ive tried to deny you your opinion. Nowhere have I said you are not allowed to  believe what you believe. All Ive said is I disagree with it. Does it really take 5 comments for you to understand that we are on two separate sides of a debate and I am simply giving you my opinion on the situation? Im glad weve finally come to this conclusion.
hm7zg3r,Excalidorito,11/26/2021,1,277.0,Wait you were defaulted to EUNE?  My account has always been EUW unless I changed it manually.
hm7np3y,uncertainrandompal,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,he also said yamato knew and advised him to go home while yamato himself said in interview he didn’t know anything.  Upset doing is exactly what expected - damage control with zero new information.  also “needed my immediate attention” and playing arams with his wife whole day and days after as well looks like bullshit as well.
hm7lz86,JumpscareRodent,11/26/2021,1,86.0,Shacos boxes and Heimerdingers turrets display the old portrait icon in-game when you target them. Top left. Not sure if you can fix those :)
hm8lxe8,vulgarny,11/26/2021,1,121.0,Solid NA lineup
hm7hzzv,TechnalityPulse,11/26/2021,1,120.0,Ya theres a reason before smurf queue was implemented people would just smurf to get to challenger quick long-standing accounts MMRs are pretty hard-locked by the system. Soft resets only help to alleviate the problem to a small degree. There should be options for a hard reset on an accounts MMR or something along those lines. Even if it means you have to restart from Silver or not allowed to play ranked for a month/year w/e.  My main account thankfully has Diamond MMR and maintains it but it struggles to get higher MMR without me winning like 10-15 games in a row. And 1 loss resets my work. But conversely its so hard for me to lose Diamond MMR that even if I troll like 10 games in a row Im still not losing more than 15 LP a game.  If I took a smurf and brought it to Diamond with 65-70% winrate itd have masters MMR and Id basically skip D4/3.

hm7lmc4,laparts,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Nobody is saying they should know. His teammates have a right to know why their entire years worth of practice and results were wasted because of Upset and privacy is a complete non-excuse to not tell them.
hm7s5jp,zUkUu,11/26/2021,1,15.0,It doesnt has to be. 😏
hm7bl16,cptlf,11/26/2021,1,39.0,Something happened in the team. There is 0 communication as to why players decided to leave.
hm77dtf,Wompond,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Reddit vultures don’t need to know
hm891ez,Moon_Breaker,11/26/2021,1,10.0,Big fat nope from me on this.  Just one more reason for people to blame each other.  You drafted x champ when y dragon was going to be on the map?? omg you just lost us the entire game  Before the game even starts.  No thank you Im against anything that is going to tilt people before the game even starts.  Plus Xerath(ex) 1-tricks would dodge every Cloud soul People would flame their jungle for not picking a champ that focuses dragons when its a Chem soul etc.  Just 100% unnecessary.  &#x200B  The entire game doesnt need to be mapped out before it starts.  Evolving strategy on the fly to adjust for things like what soul pops up is a big part of gameplay.  This is like arguing that we need to see the enemy teams roles/runes/summoners before the game - No we dont.  You adjust to what is there after Lobby and go for the win.

hm7u8wd,Nanah32,11/26/2021,1,52.0,I dont think the comparison holds tbh. The Shys peak was so insane that other players wasnt even in the same league as him. Ronaldinho at his peak was a top 5 player in the world but he definitely wasnt the best player by far.
hm84obv,HappyLittleLongUserN,11/26/2021,1,159.0,Well yes if you want to climb from plat to dia. But here its bronze to silver which should be easy enough with how many game this guy plays. Understanding his champion would be the first step.

hm7lr3z,Craftingistheway,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Just because they feel that way does not mean their feelings are valid. In fact they just reveal they are to inmature to accept that the managment who has details accepted Upsets reasoning. It doesnt matter one tiny fucking bit of shit what they feel in that case. It isnt for them to decide this is between FNC managment and Upset.   &#x200B  I mean how on gods fucking earth are people STILL to stupid to understand Upsets situation is rather ....unique and not easy when even fucking RICH is DEFENDING FNC. Like why are people to lazy to follow the stuff actually even commeting?!...
hm8blhw,Soraman36,11/26/2021,1,12341.0,I like how the show keeps everything consistent with Jinx like when other characters are just about to make things better. She makes everything worst.
hm7i9sv,Ulyrres,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,Fnatics management flat out said they dont know the specifics of the issue just that he stressed its severity. There are a limited number of issues that I personally feel fall into the category of worth missing Worlds and screwing your team over and I can guarantee if any of the things on that list were happening in my personal life I absolutely would not be playing League of Legends

hm7grqd,Tilterino247,11/26/2021,1,144.0,Theres no source for this besides fans bootyholes and if we follow a few simple steps of logic we can find that its probably not true.   Would TL want to keep paying Jensen and not have him play? No benefit to them and great cost. So theyre probably motivated to sell appropriately. Would Jensen want to afk instead of competing? Based on his words I would think not.   Tl would rather sell him for peanuts than keep paying him and have him ride the bench. Jensen himself would rather take a pay cut than ride the bench.

hm7cela,Lahwtiste,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,I wouldnt really insult Adam by saying hes moronic.    He has the right to be frustrated even if its because he cant relate to what Upsets going through. He also has the right to take it the wrong way when he learns that he could be replaced.   Though he acted like a child the moment he spread his own speculation knowing full well that communities will warp that part (that its not a fact) and made public things that should be private.    People saying that what hes done is heroic or good for the scene are just drama hungry ready to sell whatever decency they might have left for a gossip.

hm7d4d1,Btigeriz,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,That is literally not what he said though. He says Upset has shared some details with me but I dont need to know everything... and then talks about trusting Upset because he knows how much Worlds meant to him. At least watch it before saying BS.
hm7352p,Seneido,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,i mean you can pretty much marry daily if you want to...
hm7ohf6,RemoteAnalysis3809,11/26/2021,1,,>Upsets actions have consequences beyond him  And that could well be why he chooses to stay silent too. From everything I have seen so far the dude is clearly not keeping secrets only for himself.   I personally am willing to tell my coworkers everything about myself but I will not be going around telling my loved ones trauma to my coworkers knowing full well the story may end up on this subs front page ready to be dissected memed and joked about by literally millions of 15yo dudes.   The fact that every single person who knows what exactly went down have come out and expressed support for Upset should tell us there are consequences if Upset spills the beans as well.   Dude made a difficult choice. And I like that he sticks with it till the end despite all the hate towards him and his family.

hm876d5,porridge_in_my_bum,11/26/2021,1,159.0,You already have the answer in your post. He’s blaming his problems on teammates and “OP” champs and not focusing on what he himself is doing wrong. I have friends like this too it’s not really possible to improve with that mentality.
hm72p4h,Azafuse,11/26/2021,1,133.0,A cappella should be voice only this is voice+editing software. I can make my voice sounds like a turbo jet engine with editing i cant with just my vocal cords.
hm7swxy,goliathfasa,11/26/2021,1,253.0,Yeah I see what you mean and where you come from.  Especially if you feel in love with the in game versions of the champs and now comparing them with their Arcane versions they’re quite different even though they’re supposed to be canon.  Honestly I just end up treating the Arcane Jinx and the game Jinx as different characters. Unless in season 2 they manage to further her transformation and tie it neatly to her in game self I have a pretty easy time to just see them as separate versions of the same character.  Kind of like comics Peter Parker and MCU Peter Parker if you know what I mean.
hm8566c,Jiffyyy,11/26/2021,1,143.0,of course it makes things easier this is not about what is easiest this is about boundaries and personal space and respecting it.

hm7c5o5,963852741hc,11/26/2021,1,61.0,Agreed but If he was such a hype job as op is implying then I would have heard from him evens a little don’t ya think?

hm7bjpr,xCherry,11/26/2021,1,42.0,They had to rent the whole hall to accommodate the flooding of people that visited the Riot booth the prior years they also hosted the EULCS Playoffs over the course of those days there. So in 2015 the visitor count would have doubled and it would get too expensive for the limited exposure the booth would offer.  Gamescom nowadays is a chore to attend to when you look at the visitor numbers and that event area didnt get any bigger over the years.
hm7qofu,eddeadcosta,11/26/2021,1,22.0,Yuh Idk whats up with it dudes in the comment gave the answer and I finally got around to playing and confirming it worked. Idk why i couldnt find it on google either
hm76fyg,moroheus,11/26/2021,1,42.0,Or maybe you just dont understand it correct
hm7ox7g,firechaox,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Right because Adam has no rights to talk about his situation to his fans. Forgot that upset is the only person here with rights and Adam isnt a public person allowed to engage with people... upset to some degree yes did lose some right to privacy indeed- and so did his girlfriend by the way given that they both literally make a living from being public figures and interacting with them. Adam didnt say anything that wasnt to some degree public knowledge or already rumored and what he says is that he wasnt given any particular reason only a vague reason that he doesnt think is what happened (that upset left merely because his girlfriend was supposedly sad) but that until he hears something better it is What he will go with I guess.   He even has a surprising amount of perspective and he cites the reason he ultimately left was that he they were trying to replace him and didnt feel valued in comms ... seems super valid for someone to leave if he doesnt feel valued.
hm74bf3,InactivePudding,11/26/2021,1,141.0,It is not my fault that they are homophobic.
hm7dxc9,Ok_Dot9858,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,No I don’t. We simply don’t know what happened and that’s all I am stating. Our best guess is to refer to those who know. And they clearly decided even in light of the importance of the upcoming event
hm8sq8z,Totally_Not_Evil,11/26/2021,1,20.0,Tbh something easy mechanically that can let you focus on the bigger picture. Try amumu. Theres some nuance but compared to other Champs hes pretty easy to learn and as a jungler youll learn map awareness much quicker.  Downside is junglers get flamed constantly. So be prepared.
hm77xat,doglop,11/26/2021,1,1.0,It made him bad not the worst. You also have to count the fact that the chem terrain also fuck him up a bit

hm7dra6,Dark-Dragon,11/26/2021,1,166.0,Valorant isnt any better from what I can tell. Accounts are hardlocked to a region there and without a VPN or someone to create account for you I dont think you can even create an account to play on a different region.  Either way Riot fucked up big time when they announced their whole Riot games account making things global and whatsoever while completely failing to deliver on the promise. I distinctly remember them almost stealing my account name because its not globally unique whereas Im like yeah of course its not I had to create like 4 different accounts including PBE to play the game LUL.  Meanwhile instead of needing just one account to play globally I had to create another new account because even my NA LoL account was region bound to Europe when I tried to use it to play Valorant with my American friends. This entire clusterfuck is such a 1998 experience of a hassle. Just let me use one account to play wherever I want it really shouldnt be so hard.
hm87sq4,cpm67,11/26/2021,1,561.0,Bloodline: Warlord was filthy
hm7ql85,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,17.0,I think top lane needs the most love that role is horrible to play no one cares about you. Youre either weak sided the entire game or youre expected to carry the game.   I think in general jungle is still always going to be the strongest role and its hard to balance considering how much they can affect every lane.  I think jg/top/ad probably the most 3 toxic roles in order when climbing in under masters. Its probably the same in high elo too when I think about it.
hm7k8xw,WervieOW,11/26/2021,1,22.0,I can only assume you are low elo and I do not mean to insult you. But “just CC” doesn’t apply to tanks for once Yone is not tanky he has self sustain as long he is not CC’ed.   “Just CC” is harder on range champions and high mobility champions that can be difficult to predict. Yones mobility is rather straight forward his ult has an indicator and so does his E.   There is a reason why Yone is sitting on a steady negative winrate.  Yes he has that 1v5 potential if he gets super fed but so does Kassa Vlad Kata Yasuo Cassio Kayn Darius the list is endless.   Take it or leave it but negative winrate on average is not a broken champion.
hm6y90z,zNYNz,11/26/2021,1,8.0,No thanks.  That just means the scrapgoat for losing the match is readily presented to the team by the game.  In fact it will probably increase toxicity in a way that is harder to punish (e.g. game play toxicity).
hm7hact,--------V--------,11/26/2021,1,74.0,I can’t stand the LEC I was glad they lost but this was some bush league bull shit and I don’t need to know the reason but his teammates sure as fuck did. How can anyone justify him not telling him teammates? I will never get that hoe you can abandon your teammates without giving them a reason.
hm7o6ue,HuaRong,11/26/2021,1,120.0,Its comments like yours part of the reason why Riot doesnt communicate much. As soon as someone says anything you jump on them and ask them to do a bunch of work theyre not even responsible for.
hm7b79q,DT-Z0mby,11/26/2021,1,157.0,uh the us is smaller than europe in fact. EU is 10.2M km^2 and the US is 9.8M km^2. also EUW has like twice NA playerbase while EUNE has a similar amount to NA.

hm7131a,EnjoyThisAfternoon,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,apparently Upsets PR team doesnt understand what you said. Not a single shred of admitting that he might fucked up with his teammates. Hope his problems at home are solved but he looks really bad to me.
hm72wf0,Tittymotorboat,11/26/2021,1,119.0,Record is a cringe statement. Nemesis has never made semis nor an MSI finals. Shit he hasnt made finals period.  EU is dogshit stop punching down to NA. Youre literally NA tier right now based on last worlds.

hm7ujq8,BoJestemRudy,11/26/2021,1,17.0,I dont think Dopa considers people below Masters tbh. Dia 1/2 are significantly better than anyone below them and the start rank of elite players. I heard Krepo once saying a GM would easily smurf in high Dia 1 too.
hm84gbv,RegalSkye,11/26/2021,1,291.0,Oh man I feel you. Its not everyday you meet another JP server refugee. Its the negative atmosphere of the KR server without the quality of gameplay and its made worse by the sheer number of Korean/Chinese/Vietnamese invaders.

hm72b79,Aeuce,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,This entire people are entitled to feel offended argument that some people are trying to push here seems very fucking stupid when you take into consideration the fact that the community wasnt interested in what happened to Upset until Adam made the twitlonger.

hm7l1to,Spitfire836,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,We are not entitled to know however his teammates are. Telling his teammates but keeping it private from the public is a perfectly understandable move that nobody would disagree with.
hm814bt,Xyexs,11/26/2021,1,277.0,Im very confident that we are defaukted to eune. I saw a swedish streamer register an account yesterday and even back in season 4 i got lvl 20 on eune before swapping to euw.  Edit: https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Servers
hm8nfy7,keithstonee,11/26/2021,1,11.0,AP xin still can I think.  With enough AP and AS he should outheal turret damage with his passive.
hm7wfbo,EmiIIien,11/26/2021,1,12.0,I got Rio and an Arcane Powder emote. Thanks for the heads up.
hm7d7pp,Regrup,11/26/2021,1,2.0,im not arguing that
hm7z5da,Dragathor,11/26/2021,1,226.0,I mean Piltover is on the edge of a discovery with hextech I think its pretty important.
hm7dqzh,Sycherthrou,11/26/2021,1,64.0,I dont actually play adc. But [u.gg](https://u.gg) says twitch is now higher winrate with lethal than his previous patch highest winrate pta. And draven winrate is 4% higher with lethal than with conqueror.  The game hasnt really changed much for adcs outside of the addition of lethal so I am attributing all changes in winrate to the rune.

hm872na,seasonedturkey,11/26/2021,1,92.0,Weird flex but ok
hm6zzj9,Dreadedvegas,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Normal work doesn’t equate to professional sports and isn’t a good analogy.   If you work towards getting to a tournament the entire year get to the tournament and something happens where a teammate who is critical to how you win leaves and you’re told bare minimal information to why he left? The teammates have a right to be angry and publicly be angry.  I’m not stating the public should know I’m saying his teammates should know. Him not telling them is equally disrespectful of their situation as Adam publicly airing his “suspicion” on why he left
hm7avlv,Karpeeezy,11/26/2021,1,39.0,Well yeah but nowhere near the amount theyre getting paid in USD.   Besides the USD is historically the safer currency

hm6ymhr,Neestz,11/26/2021,1,8.0,If someone flames me while i have said nothing i dont want them to know they are being ignored 100%. Let them flame as long as they flame and think they are being heard theres less of a chance theyre going to int/run it down mid. And also...  its just more satisfying knowing they are screaming at you while your ears are plugged <3
hm88gqc,BudderPoros,11/26/2021,1,13.0,My group plays anywhere from 3-8 games (6 average) almost everyday. (Draft pick not alt game modes)
hm7sc3m,Twouseacc,11/26/2021,1,551.0,Yeah great concept honestly but I hate the exection.  I like how they handled sylas you have to  think about which ultimate is the best for a situation and you could also take an ultimate and save it for when the right moment comes and you can only have one per fight (for most of the game) so you had to really make it count sure sometimes there is only one good ult and you keep taking that the entire game but when you DO have a choice it feels great.  Very much unlike viego where you simply take anything and everything that comes up and yeah you can still think about who to possess first and what not it really just feels like you take whatever comes up mash all keys at once and move on to the next target personally very disappointed with how little thought there is when the concept had so much potential that we will never see.
hm7jwou,SoloJungleSenpai,11/26/2021,1,130.0,Hilarious experience lol. I guess instead of learning all that you should just focus on raw mechanics and matchups seeing the jungler approach with the ward helps so you can prepare yourself to win the 1v2 (in toplane that is mid is often more difficult as far as Im aware). Until high platinum (or beyond that even) the ganks are extremely uncoordinated
hm7tm90,mistahhbubbles92,11/26/2021,1,64.0,You should marry her instantly

hm7okww,adek13sz,11/26/2021,1,252.0,That would be glorious. French/Spanish people vs Polish people.
hm709se,NamelessSearcher,11/26/2021,1,85.0,Yeah same! The first season was fantastic especially cause Jimmy Tetro was amazing as the main guy (his YouTube series balcony conversations is also great).
hm6yo2u,Judgejudyx,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,I have no issue with family emergencies. My issue as an unbiased na fan. Is that after he left worlds even for a good reason. He tried to replace adam/nisqy. Even if I had no choice and had to leave worlds. I would feel so guilty for my teamates. I wouldnt try to replace my mid and top who performed great.
hm7eq2z,Dobby_Knows,11/26/2021,1,72.0,Lol “that guy” is a challenger player and predator eve is her best rune atm so good shit bro

hm8541y,PhreakRiot,11/26/2021,1,92.0,Ironically support has your highest winrate and fewest games while jungle has your lowest winrate. Caveat that jungle went 200 lp higher but Support seemed to actually be your easiest climb by results.
hm7wzlk,FancyTopVR,11/26/2021,1,8.0,also Im not good at the game since I am new. I doubt that I would be able to carry
hm72y7r,Fuhreeldoe,11/26/2021,1,46.0,Once again incorrect. And the reason Ive not engaged with you specifically as youll note there are plenty of others Ive been more than happy to go back and forth with is because of how youve presented yourself. Not as someone looking to have a discussion or debate but as a pseudo intellectual who smells an opportunity to assert dominance but now cant account for his false conjecture. Not only do know how I feel about the show as a whole its obvious to you the character flaws that lead me to those incorrect assertions. Objectivity and conjecture do not go hand in hand quite the opposite actually. And you dont even realize that that is your real problem. Its not that hate is the wrong word to describe how youve extrapolated I must feel about the subject its the fact that you think you know that in the first place. This is what you have to take into consideration if you want to be taken seriously in a debate as someone with validity to their contribution. Though Im not quite sure thats what you really care about as you strike me as someone just out to make themselves feel or look superior. Do I know that? No. I have no idea what kind of person you are nor your motivations for continuing a conversation that has clearly upset you. And thats the type of objectivity you lack which makes you pointless to engage with. Or as a wise man once said a waste of time. You dont know how to argue you know how to reddit argue. Which you are pretty adept at but nonetheless.
hm6yt9g,Metaxpro,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,>I mean... nothing wrong with selling her nudes if she wants to.     Yes Im sure theres nothing wrong with being married to someone that others can just google up for their naked body she was selling so easily like it was street hotdog. Does absolutely nothing to either ones mental and has no effect on a relationship dynamic.   Downvote all you want because its the age of empowering women no matter what they do but this shit can ruin peoples lives and by the time they actually realize that its already too late.
hm7gq3x,PoachedByCarlos,11/26/2021,1,1301.0,Im talking about telling his teammates not the public. Who cares about some Twitter nerds.

hm8tp39,,11/26/2021,1,,[deleted]
hm877op,bns18js,11/26/2021,1,92.0,> Every role has harder and easier champions support has few extremely high skill cap ones but that doesnt make the average player much different.  The hardest support champs are easier than the hardest champs in other roles. The average support champs are also easier than the average support champs in other roles.   And its not only champion kits either. What you have to do in your role also matters alot. A xerath played in the mid lane is harder than a xerath played in the support position even if theyre literally the same champion. Having to contest/get every CS while also aiming your skillshots is much harder than just aiming your skillshots.  >Seraphine is all skillshots apart from a high CD shield obviously more to keep track of than Annie or twisted fate even.  In insolation if you ONLY talk about spells sure. But have you seen a challenger twisted fate lane? Its alot of very precise mouse movements much much harder than what a challenger seraphine has to do in lane.   Also skillshots is like the worst argument lmao. Vayne for example has zero but nobody is insane enough to call her easier than seraphine. Because obviously vayne needs so much more mouse precision/speed and reflex to properly kite and do damage while seraphine can sit miles back with low APM and still get alot of value out by throwing out some easy spells in peoples general direction.  >But because one is a support role (and frankly because one is a cute aesthetic character) its considered mechanically easy by people who have never played the role.  I explained why above. Also again youre **ignoring** the fact that support is the least popular role and what casuals gravitate towards making it the role with the least amount of competition.  >It only becomes a gap in role skill in extremely few picks like Akali or azir but 99.999% of the people calling support easy cant play those champion at a master+ level either  And 99.999% of support players would drop a shit ton of elo if they played anything else. While other roles switching to support can stay even or even climb.
hm88usb,AshesOntheFire778,11/26/2021,1,51.0,Hes a noob stomper that falls off as elo increases.
hm8ass8,Toplaners,11/26/2021,1,108.0,>>I would call adcs the worst overall players at the same elo they look the worse off role whereas you can trust non 1 trick support players to competently play midlane most of the time.  You can trust any non support player to play support competently but I would never want a support player in any solo lane.  Sup players in solo lanes are free food unless they play something like karma or seraphine.
hm7zuml,Rekkles210,11/26/2021,1,6.0,no shot
hm71mgh,Dragathor,11/26/2021,1,518.0,Lux W was supposed to give 20%cdr and stealth all allies it hit and her ult was supposed to blind.
hm7nyye,olsi995,11/26/2021,1,6.0,People simply dont know how proper macro works. To add something that wasnt mentioned yet if you get a group that listens to calls try getting into the enemy base through the bot lane. Its the lane furthest away from Baron. This allows you more opportunities to get the buff and finish the game or at least take down a good chunk of their base.
hm8dewd,Toplaners,11/26/2021,1,165.0,Nope graves toplane is broken and you will never be able to convince me otherwise 😎
hm7cogw,Head-Command281,11/26/2021,1,65.0,Appreciate it man
hm7jyww,ExcellentPastries,11/26/2021,1,198.0,Speaking solely to upside/potential Summit and Berserker have way higher ceilings than TL’s top and bot. Fudge could end the season better than Bjerg but I think only the most extreme C9 fans think that’s going to happen. Blaber and Santorin are both fairly known quantities but when he’s playing at his best Blaber is simply better.  I can’t stress how much this all relies on everything going right - their ceiling is high but their floor is low. TL even at its worst should still be a top 2 team in NA. C9 at its worst is like scraping into playoffs and praying for a miracle run. If I’m betting money on who goes to MSI it’s TL by a mile then 100T then C9.
hm8jha2,doglop,11/26/2021,1,26.0,Also im in plat on my first year of this game if there something im gonna easily do is get in high elo and wish there no more bot adcs every game

hm7xjk8,Coc0tte,11/26/2021,1,1589.0,People can be mad about the situation but they have no reason to be mad at Upset specifically especially his teammates who know how committed he was to the competition.

But we arent talking about the investors were talking about his team-mates.  > with maybe one of the worst medical systems in western Europe...  Whats that got to do with literally anything? You think the NHS is struggling because the staff treat each other like human beings and have some empathy or what?
hm7ehqg,Migraine-,11/26/2021,1,56.0,Yes Im currently a doctor. If I said I have to leave I have a family emergency I would be allowed (actually encouraged) to leave no further questions asked.

hm7o8fa,BBQMasterDad,11/26/2021,1,19.0,Depends what ELO you’re in honestly. Anything under Plat I’d say fuck the wave state and just take what you want. Do you seriously think some pisslow Gold knows anything about wave management? Now this being said if the wave LOOKS like it’s in a good spot I wouldn’t touch it such as your laner is walking back into lane and a nice wave is built up even if unintentional.

hm7f5mq,GiannisisMVP,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,I think its worse actually.   They are directly attacking his wife as far as we know with LS that only escalated to the level of attacking someone besides him once.
hm8654r,Empty_ManaPotion,11/26/2021,1,14.0,the fact that people dont buy GW on their own shows how bad people are and play on autopilot 24/7.
hm7dmce,phranq,11/26/2021,1,,I didn’t say he was. I said people are free to think whatever they want about him and gave an example.

hm72hq7,Lahwtiste,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Sometimes I wonder if people read twitlonger or announcement.  He said that over the course of 2 weeks (during bootcamp) there were 2 meetings with the team (which we can expect to be the staff and player on site)  and that during both of those he explained he was dealing with severe family issues and it impacted him. Its only at the last minute that the situation went worse and at that moment he felt he had no other choice but to go back home. Before that point it was just a possibility.  We dont know exactly how it happened but its safe to assume that it actually did so he didnt leave the team in the dark.

hm87igu,murp0787,11/26/2021,1,143.0,Thats fine but people dont have to respect some vague bullshitty answer.  People spent a year working towards something and he screwed them the night before.  If someone did that to me and that was the best they could offer Id be pissed and I wouldnt respect it because they dont respect me by doing what they did and not saying something more specific.
hm74whr,Helluiin,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,> Before he left he told the team that his wife is feeling bad/ in pain/lonely something along those lines.   hasnt this been confirmed to be not true?

In any company if you tell someone two weeks before the project is due that you are dealing with issues at home you get someone to help you or you are replaced form the project. either fnatic coaching and management is kinda incompetent or b he didnt express the issue as clearly to everyone given that all other players so far mentioned they only found out the night before.

hm785wi,rudebrooke,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,I guess you dont understand the word emergency then do you?   Here Ill help you out.   Emergency: a serious unexpected and often dangerous situation requiring immediate action.  If you think that a close one is in urgent trouble projects a more serious issue than there is a serious family emergency and I have to leave Ill have some of what youre on thanks.
hm7ij8b,Craftingistheway,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,They dont tho. It is none of their buisness.  The only one who have any right to know are his employeer to be able to judge if they can/want to work with him. He provided them information they go on with him.  THAT IS ALL they are entilted too. Their org checking with the player if that was a legit emergcy or not.  They are NOT entilted to know details to bascially go ahead and question their judgment. That is not how this works .     And ruined is a hard word for a french fucktard who got even put on the map and a midlaner that got screwed not by worlds performance but the org greeding for buyouts.  Besides getting still a sizeable salary. Yeah obv their ambition is worlds but there is a limit to everything and they got plenty out of that year still.      It is indeed not a controversial opinion because there is no opinion to be had. There are the fact they are NOT entilted to further informations and the judgment lies within the org. End of story.

hm7lj4j,WervieOW,11/26/2021,1,150.0,He literally shits on Jensen’s proview every time he can. What is more fun is a gold player saying how the pro view should look. Look at the fucking results instead of F1 F2 etc. spamming like any other korean player.
hm8msxb,FiraGhain,11/26/2021,1,191.0,Why would Jensen want to take a paycut? Especially to a team that probably wouldnt even be competitive? If no deal happens he sits on a bench collecting the easiest million dollars of his life. He might prefer to compete given the chance but outside of the usual big spenders nobody wants to shell out that much on a single player. He isnt by far the best mid - and by that I mean the gap between him and an average cheap mid is not too vast or insurmountable. Far more economic to split that pay across a team of above average players and hope they develop into star players.

hm6y67j,Agreeable_Junket_271,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,No its completely understandable to not reveal the specifics of the upset situation but from what fnc players have said it seems they didnt even receive enough information to get an idea of the gravity of the situation upset was in - you dont need to reveal specifics to do that. For example dire medical emergency would be sufficient
hm7rzm9,ViraLCyclopezz,11/26/2021,1,24.0,I like darius
hm7agee,Risicoco,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,>deserve some sort of explanation  They got told it was a family emergency. Thats really all they need to know. No one has the right to know details.   And Adams twitlonger and the reaction of the French community just proves that it was right to not tell them details. You just have to look at DL to see what happens when hatemobs learn about a family tragedy.
hm7b1kb,butt_collector,11/26/2021,1,115.0,>I know he cares about his rank because when I watch him play hes almost always raging at teammates or op champs or whatever   Heres your answer. He cant improve because he doesnt see that hes the reason hes not winning more.  edit: Additionally I bet its some combination of the following:  -Doesnt ward   -Doesnt ping   -Dies too much   -Doesnt consider where unaccounted-for enemy champions might be when venturing beyond safety   -Doesnt manage to keep focus over the duration of a 30+ minute game (an underrated skill)   -Doesnt know how to press an advantage when he gets one   -Constantly changing champions maybe roles too. Severe deficit of champion mastery because its easier to learn a new champ than to learn to look at minion waves differently   -Severe deficit in one or more of the following areas that he is unwilling to address: mechanics of movement wave management CS fundamentals of trading mid-game decision making teamfight positioning. I know Im bad at wave management but some people in platinum are too so that cant be it.  1000-1500 ranked games in a season is *a lot.* This person has invested a ton of their life in this game likely to the detriment of other areas. He probably has in fact accumulated a considerable amount of game knowledge both explicit (declarative) knowledge and implicit (procedural) knowledge. Some of that knowledge is almost certainly *wrong.* He probably has years of terrible habits built up.
hm7wt1v,Salvage570,11/26/2021,1,,Damn coming out swinging for no reason. Real reddit moment. They went directly out of highschool into living with a group of other people in the exact same situation and spend 10 hours a day playing LoL. It takes dedication and skill to do that but I doubt its allowed them to mature emotionally at the normal rate. The fact Adam went and took the beef public while KNOWING this was an extremely personal and emotional matter for upset kinda proves that.

hm72mq8,Odd_Play_5769,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,I guess it depends on what you value. Obviously this is a HUGE grey area for EVERY human most humans dont even know what they value themselves and they are THEMSELVES. So your perspective is fair. Generally speaking I try to be as transparent as possible with everyone in my life but especially my coworkers and while I rarely get that back from them I do expect it on some level. Whats interesting to me is if Upset simply said nothing the whole situation would have blown over in a couple days but speaking in this instance made it worse
hm70x5t,lboms1,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,not sure what you mean about yours since i dont actively participate in any community thankfully  didnt know the comments on twitter were made by redditors or the ones by KC owner or coach as well. thats interesting!
hm7hacq,the-lonely-corki,11/26/2021,1,53.0,How the fuck has no one said rumble? He has 7 main runes he can run and he can be played in every single role without being considered troll besides maybe adc and even that ain’t bad rumble has got to be the most versatile with gragus slightly below   There are several different items you can take with rumble as well the only thing rumble can do is become a tank
hm6ydog,EternalEagleEye,11/26/2021,1,549.0,Yeah haven’t reviewed League’s in forever either. Just figured I’d mention it so if you do hear that in this or another game it doesn’t always mean your account is getting deleted even if you’re well past their “cutoff date.”
hm7z2ov,Jonoabbo,11/26/2021,1,,Wunder is past his prime because of one bad split? Saying he was terrible the entire year is just not true. He was worse than his usual standard but by no means terrible.   No player will be flawless every season and if one bad season means you should never be on a top tier again the entire cast of top tier players would need to be replaced with rookies.

His teammates shouldnt need to know every detail: Adam Bwipo and Nisqy should be more like Hyil and just understand that severe family issues is enough information.

hm8nw7y,bburgers9,11/26/2021,1,13.0,If you still enjoy this game then good for you. All I know is a lot of people dont feel the same. Most streamers that Im aware of from bigger ones like Tyler1 and Faker to medium and lesser-known streamers like Nemesis Dzukill Foxdrop SRO etc have expressed some pretty serious dissatisfaction with the current state of the game. That dissatisfaction reaches a lot of computer screens. The larger streamers cant really quit because its their livelihoods but they would if they could. Many smaller streamers have.

hm71i3x,Musashis_Balls,11/26/2021,1,484.0,Buy back(essentially allowing you to 10v5 from behind. Slew of active items to deal with super fed carries even when behind. “Just to Shan and various jungle creeps”   I think league players would naturally underestimate just how important the jungle is to a true moba. They all spawn every minute in dota and are a viable way to catch up from a bad lane. They require you to control parts of the map with vision and are a huge reason why dotas macro makes so much more sense than leagues practically non existent macro. I just had a game with MK where I was 0-3 and was able to come back positive by the end of the game because they didn’t control our jungle so I was able to farm up some key items and become strong again.   If you lose lane in league it’s basically GG for you as you stand around in the back line hoping not to get picked off first.   Honestly you should watch pro dota games. It’s very common for a team to win even when they are down 10k+ net worth because they simply outplayed the other team. That would be an absolute impossibility in league. Even with dragon buffs the team that’s already ahead are just going g to grab those far easier so that ends up just being more of a “help the snowballing team snowball more” mechanic.
hm7rpcm,smashspete,11/26/2021,1,144.0,You just described 95% of players on League tbh. They want a higher rank but dont really care to play the game and think about what they can do to improve. Every game they play they focus on looking at how everyone else is playing to criticize it instead of just focusing on their own performance regardless of what their teammates are doing. thats literally all there is to it. its a maturity thing to be honest or lack of

hm7xp9h,atarasiirei,11/26/2021,1,156.0,Unfortunately your friend has an addiction issue and does not care about winning as much as it seems. He cares about sheltering his fragile self-image much more than he cares about winning.   About 40% of league players are this way. Another 40% just treat it as any other game as a means of entertainment rather than a self-defining pursuit of mastery. The last 20% actually want to win and get skill capped between diamond and challenger.   Yes anyone who is not at least diamond is in the 80% and quite a few diamond players themselves are there too.
hm773ie,blueragemage,11/26/2021,1,22.0,yeah theres a chance TL got paid money to hold Alphari for a year depending on Alpharis yearly salary and buyout

Its certainly not common but sometimes ones talent can take them to heights unreachable by most without a great work ethic.
hm81ohv,Mejalu,11/26/2021,1,11.0,If you q up and press find match play the game. Thats what Im saying. Positive attitude isnt going to hinder your performance.   Your negative attitude and your I cant do anything about it attitude attributes to the toxicity that is prevalent in this game.
hm7lz1s,AsahiMizunoThighs,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,True but ymmv on how much you view League players as celebrities and being a celebrity doesnt make invasion of privacy acceptable. We can do better imo : /

hm79gk1,Falsus,11/26/2021,1,144.0,Playing on both. Diamond on EUW and Gold on EUNE. A gold in EUNE is kinda equal to a gold in EUW but matchmaking is a bit more wild in EUNE so you get less balanced teams.

hm7c4iv,kazuyaminegishi,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,Yes I do lmao what kind of question is that? If something happens that I find far more important than what Im currently doing comes up and it requires my attention then I give it my attention. If it screws someone over I will apologize but thats all they get. My choice wont change just because they feel bad I just have to accept they feel bad.  They can think im lying all they want to it doesnt matter if they want to sleuth into my personal life so they can play judge and jury on whether Im allowed to prioritize different shit from them then thats stupid.  If they dont believe me when I say I find this more important than that well tough for them.  Again you can make it sound as complicated as you want to but the simplistic situation is that Upset felt something important more important than worlds happened. So he left to address that. His teammates dont need to know what that is and it doesnt matter if they think its as important Upset thinks its that important. If they dont believe him they can be mad about it until the day they die it still doesnt mean they need to know anything more.

hm7tuhv,LakersLAQ,11/26/2021,1,89.0,He probably still is tbh. TL wanting a better player is probably what lowered his value but he is still super valuable due to him not counting as an import. Hes still one of the better top laners to have if you want a championship contending roster.
hm7eguy,PepelaTeaTime,11/26/2021,1,70.0,We are literally in agreement on the basis that its fictional. Personally I am not offended due to not being culturally connected with any of the characters but just because you and I dont give a shit doesnt mean it invalidates others perceptions and opinions.   > I am chinese and I dont give a shit about whether wukong is not chinese enough because I have better things to do.  Okay? Some Chinese dont give a shit about their historical conflict with western colonialization some dont care about the Japanese imperialism nor the constant microaggressions the Chinese diaspora face overseas. Doesnt mean you should invalidate peoples opinions on a variety of topics although they may not hold the same weight. Different people have different priorities and principles.  > Yeah and I know that. And anyone with half a brain knows that she is not representative of what korean culture really is because its a fictional character in a game.  Her garments are very Korean with a butterfly 노리개 and traditional shoes called 당혜. She was also created to celebrate and accommodate the opening of the Korean servers.  Ahri is fictional and an Ionian first but the inspiration and intent of her character heavily skews that she was meant to represent Korean culture or at least their traditional garments since culture can be an amalgamation of a variety of aspects.  > Well let see. If a imaginary character triggers someones cultural sensitivity and they feel the need to spend time to whine about it on the internet then yes they should uninstall and do something else.  How about you improve your reading comprehension before you attempt to characterize someone you dont even know? I clearly stated that I am aware that she is fictional and that this was just an observation of appropriation that can trigger a lot of Koreans.   If you think I am whining about cultural sensitivity you definitely remind me of some conservative neckbeard who whines more than the SJWs he/she whines about.

Its not childish when people career will be gone after this. Proper explaination for absent is a given. Both Fnatic management and Upset fail to deliver a message that can make his team understand the severity of what Upset is facing.  If u cant understand it that ok.   Moreover I dont like both of them but i can understand Adam feeling more. Also another FNC management fail in their duty this tweet had last for 3 day now? Why no one in FNC say anything to counter Adam but outsider come and help Upset like they know more about it.
hm8rc5u,imjunsul,11/26/2021,1,58.0,Its most likely Showmaker/Faker if hes talking about it right now during off season lol.. or else he would have re-signed already.

hm7683w,Wizzdom,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Agree with this take. Family emergency is the most generic excuse for messing something there is. Tell that to the public but perhaps you owe teammates a little more since you are impacting their life significantly. On the other hand his teammates should have known he wouldnt miss worlds if it wasnt a true emergency. This is a matter of poor communication all around.

hm7ethg,rizefall,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,He told the Fnatic management what was going on and asked to leave. The teammates themselves doesnt need to fully know what happened if Upset doesnt want them to only the management does.  Its also not weird to ask your new franchise/star player what kind of people hed like to play with. He got asked he gave his opinion.  Adam is just being a big baby talking about stuff he knows nothing about.
hm7muqh,Craftingistheway,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Your ability to read is rather dogshit for an accountant. Upset did not say his teammates would weaponize it against him but people in general if the issue would become publicly known.  He has no intetntions of having a tradegy be used as flame on twitch chat 24/7 the entire next year.  &#x200B  And he doesnt have to trust him. He trusted key people in managment.  Tell me about your work enviroment where you can cause an PR drama because you cannot trust the judgment of your boss? because thats Bwipo for ya...

Yet the event was apparently not private enough to stop fucking Rich from knowing about it so... Teammates got their dreams dashed by Upset leaving. They deserved more than what they got.
hm7mzax,Judgejudyx,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,upset said he wanted alphari over adam thats not made up. im not talking about french social media
hm769la,Alakazaaamm,11/26/2021,1,22.0,Alphari signed 3 years. He is back in EU.
hm6y2av,Musashis_Balls,11/26/2021,1,484.0,I agree man it was a gem. If league moved toward the “brawler” style game I would play it a ton more when I wanted to just relax
hm7sy0n,ConscienceNot,11/26/2021,1,17.0,Play draft. Thats much better.
hm6z2d8,elikaweli,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,I have to keep my shit together right now because what you are writing is just dumb af. Bro is it upsets fault that his family has an emergency? It is not. Who the hell to you think you are to judge whether his decision is right or not? You are a god damn random fan without any information and yet you judge that it is upsets fault that he had to leave. Personal problems in your god damn FAMILY are always more important than your job. You clearly have never experience something like a serious family emergency. That is completely fine. But dont judge it then.

hm7k923,whydoyoureadnames,11/26/2021,1,92.0,False fnatic approached upset about his opinion on alphari and perkz. I get why he’s upset but I’m both scenarios he’s fundamentally misconstruing or misunderstanding what’s occurred.
hm7sknj,N7Bold,11/26/2021,1,563.0,Hey everyone I recently returned to playing league after not touching it for the better part of 6 years and I am trying to pick up and learn some new champions. I am really interested in Pyke but am not sure where he fits best. I have seen some people use him in bot as a support assassin some run mid and some jungle. I am just not sure where he is best utilized any help is greatly appreciated.
hm7ijc7,supejeroeno,11/26/2021,1,,Ahh yes when a family member is in a severe situation where they end up in a hospital just keep playing your gaming tournament for a bit and hope it ends well. Of course he himself probably couldn’t solve what was going on but at times like this it is often just about being there for each other. You have to be 12 to think this is a reasonable line of thought.

hm7u3hz,rudebrooke,11/26/2021,1,6.0,Well reddit has been screaming for more NA representation for a while now Id expect you guys to all be cheering for CLG next season considering this team is 4/5 NA with the only import being moved up from a year in Academy (obviously not here to retire or steal a paycheque did prove he was better than his NA rookie counterparts) the coaching staff is NA and theyve been very vocal about developing NA players in academy and the amateur scene.  Youre right that its not going to be easy but I think if people showed support for these young players it would be a good start.

hm7wedc,kenzomon,11/26/2021,1,1.0,It doesnt have to do with Ziggs hitbox but rather with elevation. Jhin is higher up on the map so the shot is actually lower than it looks in game. Its a pretty annoying feature of the game but you can go into practice tool and try it yourself.   Theres a pretty clear shot that looks like its going straight through the practice dummy but doesnt count as a hit. That being said as the person casting the spell you need your cursor to be pretty far off of the dummy when casting so it makes sense that the spell doesnt hit. Visually though it will still look like a hit.
hm8r1dn,Tocharian,11/26/2021,1,9.0,Well thats unlikely to happen given that person would have to accept your friend request in the first place for you to send them gifts. If someone stats sending me multiple RP gifts out of the blue Im writing a ticket to Riot support.
hm6yow4,Nicolu_11,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Ok so Ill admit it *might* be a mistranslation. The part that Im refering to says:   &#x200B  > Between us there is absolutely nothing legal in Upsets departure and his departure is totally unjustified (at least until he says why he really left BECAUSE until today Upset just left to join his girlfriend because she felt bad to be alone and maybe Im wrong who knows?  And I dont know  but she felt bad to be alone sounds weird phonetically.   However I doubt that upset said exactly My wife is feeling alone I gtg thats just stupid (but who knows maybe it did happen). Adam himself says in the above paragraph that the reasons were Urgent Family Reasons and he also writes that Maybe Im wrong who knows so its a possibility that he was speculating to generate drama.  P.D: I never pictured myself discussing about proplay drama. What has this subreddit done to me????.

hm7fmc9,Adleyy65,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,They dont deserve anything besides knowing that Upset had an important family incident. They dont need to know more and also dont deserve to know more. Or how would you feel if you had share some of your most private matters with your colleagues at work who you know for a few months. FNC Management knows it and thats enough.
hm7x2es,howtopayherefor,11/26/2021,1,558.0,Isnt that easier than it sounds? Based on that quote it sounds like the VFX were the only problem because the way theyre handled for projectiles is too inflexible. So once you have remake how the VFX work for every ability creating a new projectile just means you have to make it like the other projectiles.  It would be pretty future-proof but still not worth remaking the VFX for all current abilities
hm7jqmf,Ulyrres,11/26/2021,1,, “Also he says that he told Yamato what happened but from this video Yamato talks about Upset leaving. When talking about Upset leaving he said that he knows it must be super important because Upset is a competitor and would not give up and leave for nothing. If Yamato knew the reasons wouldn’t he be phrasing it as “Upset told why he considered leaving and I knew he needed to go home and deal with it.” Not to psycho analyze too much but it feels like Yamato doesn’t know much and is rationalizing that it must be super important because Upset wouldn’t just leave the team.”  From a comment earlier in this thread didn’t bother linking the video you can find it if you want. Someone who actually knew the reason would not have phrased it like that period. Its just backpedalling to cover for Upset because they are taking his side and he is the one continuing to play for them
hm7i11k,Mozartelivyra,11/26/2021,1,4.0,If win rate goes down they buff his numbers
hm72xrd,Vantablack9,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,> it’s more so he felt that he didn’t have to even communicate how dire the situation was to his team  But Upset says that he spoke with the team saying that he was feeling pretty bad because of it but couldnt tell them what it was. Now do we believe Upset that he said that to everyone? Thats up to each one but its weird that people keep saying this.
hm72xqe,ChapVII,11/26/2021,1,65.0,Finally someone get it and dont get trap by Silco fake caring for Jinx well being.

hm7iccm,Jiffyyy,11/26/2021,1,74.0,and that is fine. I dont think you are understanding that your way of doing this is not the golden standard of how every single person on earth handles things.
hm7z8o3,MrDrugnut,11/26/2021,1,11.0,the game isnt that hard to solve the higher elo you are. games become predictable assuming all 10 players arent going to be doing basic mistakes. i wouldnt say lost at draft but once the snowball gets going its pretty obvious. I mean they had to implement this bounty system to try and fix that issue and its still pretty bad assuming the winning team is just taking the objectives  you could say you are assuming a lot but throws rarely happen. hard to throw in a gamestate where you either one shot or overheal long gone are the days of slowpaced macro plays and creative teamfights - there is no way to make a proper mistake if the game boils down to stat checking. and the point is that we rather make 9/10 games go quicker than to fight for nothing because of the 1/10 being an example of aNyThIng CaN hAppEn  stop watching anime. sheer force of will isnt going to make the enemy mid unplug their ethernet cable. they will keep roaming and snowballing lanes and no amount of positive attitude is going to change that.

hm7larb,GutsWay,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,I dont think youve ever competed or done something that gives your life purpose and meaning for you to call a pro player immature for caring about the thing theyve devoted their entire existence towards.  They deserved to know why their goals and hardwork were nullified. Its fair for them to want to know the exact reason. A serious family issue can mean anything. All he had to do was specify hey guys I need to be with my family at this time because Im mourning the loss of a loved one etc. Instead you decide to say absolutely nothing. I know youre a silver/gold LoL redditor but dont insult peoples dreams and hardwork.

hm7nrzf,Mecketh,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,In my personal opinion this is something personal for Upset and his wife but that would not be acceptable for his teammates AND fans. Probably something that has no paper trail so he cant just state health/mental issues because he would be proved a liar.   Most personal problems can be resumed in a short way without affecting his privacy and of his family. Health/mental issues in my family is enough to cover almost every single thing and I dont think anyone would complain.   But Fanatic thinks is enough and did not fire him. Why would they fire their star ADC that they base the team on? The worst that can happen to them is some bad PR that can be dismissed easily (we just respected the player and his mental). Its not like fans would care enough after a couple of months.
hm78cwa,Risicoco,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Why do you say Bwipo is on their side. All we know is that Bwipo was frustrated about the situation but he never blamed or doubted Upset.

hm76rc3,HowTooPlay,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,You dont need to know that though and that is where the issue lies.

In his eyes he doesnt do anything wrong and its always his teammates or the enemy team. Until he stops blaming factors outside of his control and focuses solely on what he could have done better and nothing else he wont get anywhere near a decent rank
hm7npa0,Quaiche,11/26/2021,1,144.0,In addition of all of the other stuff he may have very wrong fundamentals of this game.  One example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fC1GHVET_s

hm6zwco,mistood,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,I want to give you some context on Upsets mentality.     Upset meets a camgirl/onlyfans girls who lives in South America online dates her for 2 months and decides to marry her. This is her 3rd marriage and she even has nudes available online. You can tell from her social media that she has many red flags.     Upset makes the judgement to commit to this used-up cam thot marrying her after only 2 months of dating. You think he is someone who makes smart and sensible  decisions? Hes obviously a huge simp that makes terrible life decisions. I hate how he keeps saying that the reason is due to family suffering as if his mom/dad is dying but its really he has some issues with his manipulative psychotic wife.      The fact that he chose to leave 12 hours before the first game suddenly makes me believe that the camgirl wife gave some sort of ultimatum. I do believe there is some truth in Adams statement of her feeling lonely. From her bio you can tell after they married she moved to Germany away from her home in South America. She is probably not adjusting well with no friends and family except Upset. The ultimatum was probably something like  I want to go back home to South America if you dont come back then I will leave. If his wife was truly sick it doesnt make sense that he would sudenly leave 12 hours before the game. The timing doesnt make sense. He knew he had to choose his wife or league and he chose league. The real reason would give him so much criticism that I believe he chose to put it under the guise of muh privacy. If he had a real reason people would understand support and respect his decision to leave.

hm7kgr0,Rikkimaaruu,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Iam german and learned basic english in school like most europeans.  But i put som effort into getting better so i could communicate with People i met over the Internet. Like the russian doctor which i met in Diablo 2 two polish dudes i met in Starcraft Broodwar or the danish girl i met in Quake 3.  We all struggled with out english but it got better over time.  If you rerufse to learn english for whatever reason you miss out like 80% of the Internet Content.  And when you play Multiplayer Games and you refuse to learn at least some basic english you are doing it wrong.  Nothing wrong sticking to people who speak your native language and mostly communicate in your native language that way.  But its mostly french people who stick out when it comes to these incidents. I heard its harder for french people to learn english that could play a role but still that should not hinder you from at least trying.
hm8c43d,TheScyphozoa,11/26/2021,1,4.0,>so i know its impossible to only play with bots  Not true. You can play with yourself + 4 bots vs 5 bots.  You will never level up your account so youll need to pay real money for every champion you want to play as...
hm73g3w,Naerlyn,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Thats normal though (your experiences with this I mean).   Part of the French people will speak French even though there are people around who wont speak that language. The other part will stick to English unless everyone is French. (You could say that about every language/nationality only with different proportions for each with obviously countries like France Spain and Germany having a lot more of the former than Nordic countries.)  The people who speak French while some of the people listening dont understand it are for the most part not exactly the most respectful. Or the most enjoyable ones to be around. So examples of the less pleasant cases.   On the other hand the ones who dont speak French in the presence of people of other nationalities... youd usually not know that theyre French. So the near-entirety of your experiences comes from the first part.

Also now we know something has been going on for quite a bit and it turned awful at the very end when he left so I dont see how Adam Bwipo or Nisqy were not aware something was going on but I also see no reason why they would like about it and feel so salty to air the dirty laundry online.

hm8s8du,ASKSABOUTPENISSIZE,11/26/2021,1,35.0,I’ve mained Udyr for 9 years and there are ALOT of things that counter him but not much in the strict 1v1 early game.   Some junglers who can duel him early-ish include: Viego Xin Trundle and Warwick.    Udyr is countered by him being fucking useless in team fights unless he is massively ahead. He has no dash lacklustre AOE damage Only 1 single target  CC and poor damage if not ahead.   Skarner should be able to hold his own against Udyr once the Skarner gets items but like you said not many champs beat Udyr at level 4 in a straight up 1v1. Take solace in the fact that Udyr gets out scaled by pretty much every champ in the game after two items.

hm7no6g,zackria_fuck,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,I havnet seen one comment about that. I haven’t seen one that means we as the public deserve to know! Because that’s just bullshit. His team deserves to know tho. At least enough information to not being able to make assumptions and they did so that means they dint get enough information and that’s on upset and the leader ship of fanatic.
hm7xwrg,karkuri,11/26/2021,1,11.0,i always play with my friend and there have been so many matches we have won because we didnt ff at 15 because enemy kata was 5/2/4. people give up way too fast

hm7dq37,3SeedsForNAisaJoke,11/26/2021,1,643.0,Oh look its Frodolas the well known racist troll on this subreddit. Imagine an American accusing others of being racist given what has happened and has been highlighted in America in recent times. Learn to read the room. The whole world is watching you shaking their heads.
hm7pfk4,Too_Many_Cooks1327,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,No. He is literally saying that there are two sides to the story and that you are calling one fact. I didnt read anywhere in that message that he chose one side over the other.

If the Ornn has half a brain and I dont have flash an Ornn ults Im slowed by the first part of his ult then knocked up then knocked up again by his Q-E and Wd followed by the empowered auto. This is just one example. Pick a tank. They can solo a lot of ADCs. I can avoid quite a bit. Its the principle that it shouldnt be a thing. If youre a tank youre a tank. You shouldnt be able to that much damage to a squishy.

hm8qpwj,imjunsul,11/26/2021,1,58.0,DK TheShy would be more hype but I have a feeling its T1 so DK dont get a top laner.. TheShy would probably perform well on a team with Canyon/Showmaker/Deokdam... I hope its not T1 TheShy tho it would suck to see Zeus not play or maybe theyll rotate again...
hm70ugt,conormcfire,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,I think some french people tend to be quite passionate and have pride in their country/countrymen but that kind of energy and in more extreme cases tribalism can really get in the of critical thinking.

From what we know of Bwipo and Adam in those regards they dont seem to be.

hm76zjk,InsuranceOne2864,11/26/2021,1,1003.0, Never thought about that but this might actually be it.    While their marriage is obviously based on a real relationship the german government might actually think it was just one of those visa related marriages considering how fast they got wedded. Maybe periodic checks on them are a thing?    A couple of years ago i knew someone who married an american just for a visa. The USA government would send someone every 2 weeks to check on them.

hm7wtqk,Angelothebaws,11/26/2021,1,15.0,Thats easy its simply because Jinx voice lines together wit other older champions needs updates. A lot of them has non be update even since the entire old lore was change Blitzcrank is the best example he still has all the murder intention voice lines when now he should not have since he is not the old murder machine Blitzcrank.

hm7i4a1,RemoteAnalysis3809,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,I mean if the consequence of this whole incident for Upset is him still earning his millions with Fnatic still able to fuck his beautiful wife and still starting as adc in one of the most stacked roster in the LEC next split then yes he is free of the consequence of **you** forming opinions about him.   The reality is people whose opinions truly matter to him have already voiced their support for Upset. Dude got the support of his coach his org his wife his (adult and non-French) fans. I say he got his priorities right.

hm74xcy,I_hate_Teemo,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,Why would he be a weasel for not telling them about his loved ones private life? I just dont understand. Noone that complained has moral or legal right to know about these private matters. It was made very clear that this was serious enough for him to leave and thats all anyone that isnt his family needs to know. The relevant people in fnc management were told confirmed it was serious enough and let him go without repercussions. Noone else needs to know.
hm8hjeh,JukebocksTV,11/26/2021,1,12.0,Theres zero high level players who would agree with this statement.

hm72363,Prottek,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,FNC required a PR to handle this if you look at the previous response considering how big the situation is it did not look well for the org and its normal for someone else to write the response for a player when it comes to that.
hm7w35q,UltraScept,11/26/2021,1,124.0,You are also similarly operating off of assumptions though? It is not like you have concrete facts of what happened. Youre basing your argument on a single statement Upset made about leaving due to a family emergency.  Its completely up to you to take Upsets words at face value but to then turn around and insult people because they are only assuming things is quite hypocritical.
hm8qors,ViraLCyclopezz,11/26/2021,1,13.0,Can we do this type of post for yorick too!
hm8emks,CantScreamInSpace,11/26/2021,1,8.0,i think the first one was just from any riot event i remember going to a convention years ago (not pax) where riot had a booth and some rioters were handing out the first ward skin and dragon slayer pantheon.

hm70p8u,Iperovic,11/26/2021,1,57.0,Because technically putting your team at a disadvantage is unfair towards the other people  If youre gonna try a new champ that is completely out of your comfort zone both thematically and in terms of the role they occupy maybe start with 20 bot games so you can at least be confident you know what their abilities are like in-game
hm8l7sf,JevonP,11/26/2021,1,8.0,Component items are significantly worse if not bought at the right times which kinda sucks but  I do think the item system is better now   One thing I dislike is how much damage there is in the game and the items could shine more if everyone wasnt so op so early now
hm84sco,Godddy,11/26/2021,1,39.0,TBF a lot of Chemtech in-game is green so I wouldnt be surprised if Shimmer mutated into a greenish color with its effect made better but less taxing in the body.

hm7jpxy,Vangorf,11/26/2021,1,,Yeah sure in a team with bot focus they had much chance to carry after their main focus player left :^) look at their first game Bwipo omegagapped the enemy jungler but since they didnt had Upset in bot they couldnt play their usual style.
hm7p0c7,maruchops,11/26/2021,1,5.0,Supports are supposed to roam if its advantageous. If theyre just routinely leaving theyre just bad.  Some support champs shouldnt be roaming either.
hm7x0jr,derreverend,11/26/2021,1,3.0,That would require extensive rewrites of code. Almost every blocking ability consists of minions. Also I don’t think minionblock is harmful necessarily
hm7cnuu,Proterragon,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,My man teammates are people who play in the same team nothing more nothing less. Thats the definition. Teammates may be professional and formal or informal and more like family or close friends. They may trust each other completely or just be distant acquaintances. You have some weird romanticized idea of the concept of teammates.  Your problem stems from the fact that you made up a different definition in your head and then that leads you to a misunderstanding with others. Cheers.

hm7fxo0,Brain_Tonic,11/26/2021,1,144.0,I think so makes his current situation even more ridiculous.
hm7x6d6,Seneido,11/26/2021,1,,it depends on the region ofc and sure there are hundreds but do people even get the biggest 10? i would guess most get around 1-3.
hm7uihs,ToasterHoaster,11/26/2021,1,563.0,Hi N7 pyke mid has seen a bunch of nerfs after he migrated to mid and he’s kinda in a weird place where he’s not the best mid or support. But with the new assassin item buffs I think he’ll be fine in either lane. Either way you’ll be playing not as a carry but more supportive. Gank as much as you can and help your jgler contest for scuttle and such. Once lvl 3 you’ll try to get picks and win 2v1s top and jg. It’s all about carrying your team since you’re not able to 1v9.  P.S. I’m not exactly the best player but I used to play a bit of him. I might be wrong but I hoped it helps you a lil bit
hm8a5k3,Krism_47,11/26/2021,1,8.0,I mean yorick can with his r but Im not sure if that counts as a minion wave. Other than that a fed tryndamere might be able to

hm74rst,InsuranceOne2864,11/26/2021,1,1002.0, Upset didnt vouch for alphari management asked him to talk to him. Management wanted adam out which is perfectly normal after his performance in finals+worlds. (dont you dare tell me troll building items losing lane hard and having 0 map awareness is due to tilt).   > one guy literally pissed 3 players in one team   I understand bwipo being pissed of but nisqy has absolutely no right to open his mouth. Maybe he should stop eating mcdonalds so he can actually press the r button.

hm8qzjl,MI8MarkusXx,11/26/2021,1,134.0,How did you get put into a gold 4 game without a duo
hm7s72b,YogurtclosetMiddle78,11/26/2021,1,149.0,The 2 events didnt happen at the same time. Jayce went down to Benzos shop and bought parts. Ekko followed him to see where he lived and went back. He then gives the tip to Vi who gets her gang together to go rob him. Which I will say the show doesnt tell you how much time has elapsed between these events so I can understand but we can assume he took those items over to his benefactor after he got home it is their gold he just spent so he would probably have to show what he spent it on. Only reason I say we can assume that is because he is coming back with Caitlyn which she wouldnt have gone down there. So the events of Ekko getting back and telling Vi Vi getting the gang and breaking in would happen between that period. Hell nothing to say him buying the parts could have happened the day before and went first thing in the morning to show what he bought to his patrons and thats when Vi broke in. Which is very plausible with the information we are given.  As far as Jayce and his decisions goes the show setup his personality from the get go he is honest and good but very naive. He wants to do right by his inventions but he keeps getting thrust into situations and leadership roles that he doesnt know how to handle. Which in steps Mel to manipulate him and the situation to her favor which he relies on because he is in over his head. You can tell that Jayce is more like himself when Mel isnt around to offer guidance.  As for Caitlyn I think she made that document and just used his stamp herself to get Vi out of prison...there is a point where they are telling Jayce what Caitlyn has been doing and the document is brought up showing his sigil on his there is a look of surprise and confusion on his face so thats the take away I got from that lol. Could be wrong on that point though not entirely sure. 😃

hm7ipnz,Random_Stealth_Ward,11/26/2021,1,540.0,Nah that was old Poppy. Ult support and kill someone else.  Fioras problem iirc was that she is already a good duelist and very mobile so when you combine that with a trapping ult you basically got a free kill on whoever you trapped and you could easily get on top of people to trap so it was too strong. Basically a rigged game..

hm7h68f,Kunzzi1,11/26/2021,1,89.0,Sound levels were scuffed and all over the place but other than that pretty great video. Give them time I just hope this team actually tries and develops future goats of LEC similar to G2 of 2019.

hm7zpyn,Dvscape,11/26/2021,1,156.0,Something that I found actually helpful is narrating out loud my thought process. Even if I am alone in game but even more so when streaming on Discord I talk through my decisions and it:  1) keeps my gameplay organized no autopilot  2) anchors my mind and makes it much harder to tilt or rage (since I have to be narrating my decision process instead of complaining about the past)  If your friend doesnt find it weird maybe ask them to try it out.
hm7djcj,Seneido,11/26/2021,1,,sometimes they are just dumb and naive like i dont get money if i dont play but why should they kick me? im the best. i also wouldnt be surprised if a lot of them are just believing and handshaking stuff like perkz/ocelote. i doubt that perkz does anything nowadays without a roster of laywers next to him.
hm7ms7e,DT-Z0mby,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,if its that easy why doesnt everyone look good when the team plays around them. the way you make it sound is that you could take any random LEC adc play around him and he looks stellar. its a bit more nuanced than that
hm77nvi,TheWarmog,11/26/2021,1,42.0,Whatever their relationship could be its not your business.    Whatever the lenght of it is and will be its not your business.   Whatever the reason they got married for is its not your business.   Whatever her past or age difference is its not your business.   Your parents failed you with the education they gave you grow the fuck up.
hm7ddoz,OvenCheese5000,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,This is why some sort of hierarchy might be needed.  After all FNC is Upsets employer and Upset is FNCs employee. If at my job I had some family emergency or something like that which required that Id be home and not working at one of the most crucial times Id have to notify my boss and tell him the reasons. He in turn would communicate this to my coworkers: both that Ill be missing and that its justified without revealing details. Thats because we can trust our boss to not give someone a pass on a bullshit excuse.   There should be a person where players are able to tell such personal stuff a person has the authority to make the call that its justified a person that the players can trust not to bullshit them if they agree with the player wholl miss a tournament.
hm7jnyp,Craftingistheway,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Adam requested to leave because he was butthurt someone even considered Alphari over him because of his overinflated ego.   Bwipo goes to a worse team then FNC?!?!? What?! I mean MAYBE but he is making bank while getting to play with 2 literall legends of the game in one of the possible best NA rosters ever....     Nisqy got fucked by FNC greeding his buyout nothing to do with worlds.  You literally dont know the most basics facts of the story for fucks sake .     Matter of the fact is that those 2 fucktards could not even accept emergency  when basically confirmed by the org as valid who have the information. What else is FNC supposed to do? They cannot reveal details they can just say he was legit to leave which they did. They didnt even look for a replacement...     Like your entire argument is based on ignorance and that full tilt children tantrum of Adam and Bwipo is anything but shameful and inexcusable.
hm743os,Lahwtiste,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,Just to clarify : Most OTP casters simply reacted with the equivalent of It sucks something happened good luck in your next team to prove yourself as a player. They didnt shit or mock upset from what Ive seen with one exception about OTP and its Karnage (cofounder and the one who manage the broadcast).     Though yeah Kcorp original founder was part of the streaming community and sadly that community has a hard time to call out someone they like. They dont understand that you can still call out someones bullshit and still be a good friend with that person. Its simply high school mentality thats being shared and reproduced by fans.
hm7rplz,Jiffyyy,11/26/2021,1,124.0,if hes allowed any personal time off in his contract you arent gonna get shit.  also what the hell would you sue him for? taking time off?

hm7wvb8,IHadThatUsername,11/26/2021,1,364.0,That was just a throwaway dig. Change that to until this year Upset couldnt qualify if you wish the point stays the same: Attila was more successful than Upset for a while and although they are quite distant now that doesnt change the fact that they had a competitive rivalry.
hm75mu4,SimbaMySon,11/26/2021,1,62.0,Welcome I’ve been in play for 4 years now. Enjoy the free skin chroma and the diamonds and above Smurf’s sprinkled with some gold shavings
hm713cx,maribri6,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Actually talking to them and explaining stuff ? Instead of saying trust me bro. Cause you have to remember that Bwipp had said in his TL he didnt understand why Upset left so the two meetings Upset is talking about mustve not led to a lot of communication.  You know communication. But hey seems FNC is bad at it since they always have drama with their players.
hm7gwga,Tabriel013,11/26/2021,1,6.0,everytime i see people discuss Arcane Vander i expect to see Oscar Bogdan and i am dissapointed over and over again
hm7ri43,ViraLCyclopezz,11/26/2021,1,120.0,What sub place do you prefer. Firehouse or Subway? Personally Im a firehouse subs fan
hm7ge1m,edgelordweeb_,11/26/2021,1,43.0,Better players get solod by worse ones all the time. Biubiu back when he was a perma weak side top and played with 0 confidence solod 369 a few times. This year Biubiu got some balls and started playing carries but was still like the 11th best top yet he had one of the highest solo kill counts in the league and those werent all on the bottom six tops either. Ale solod TheShy repeatedly in his debut match against IG in 2019 spring. Thats fucking 2019 spring TheShy. Keane famously solod 2015 Bjergsen Zed repeatedly on old Urgot. Doesnt mean much. Besides Faker has declined and is pretty washed. He used to be way better it wasnt just competition being ass.
hm7h9cs,sscyth1,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,but what is this situation can be ?   &#x200B  like there were no death involoved no major accident or shit
hm7vox0,Jonoabbo,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Beating a player in one series does not mean you are a better player than him and of course Fnatic are going to bench Adam for Wunder one has had one good split the other is the best ever western top laner.   I think making a public twitlonger trying to weaponize your fanbase to attack your former teammates and employer purely out of spite is incredibly petty especially over what is completely normal and reasonable behaviour especially your teammate who you know is going an extremely difficult personal time hence hwy he left worlds. It is incredibly disrespectful to his team and his teams staff since he believes they would let Upset leave over nothing or something trivial.    To claim he bailed on them because he had a personal emergency is ridiculous.   Also you say adam was kicked out of 1 of 2 western teams that actually have a chance at doing anything internationally. Adam *isnt* up to that standard. Hes a good player but to pretend he is irreplaceable or some elite god is insane.
hm7vocw,Young_Khalifa,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Do you think Fanatic’s coaching staff understands the game so poorly they force the team to play around bot side? Completely removed from this situation Upset was their best player. Even with everything that’s happened you should be able to see that.
hm763rn,Lahwtiste,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,What Bwipo means with they were told nothing was about the departure.     Upset said that in the last 2 weeks of the bootcamp there were meetings where it was told that upset was going through a big family issues and it impacted him. Its only at the last moment (the famous 12h before worlds start) that the situation apparently got worse and Upset decided that he had to leave.    He might have considered leaving before but didnt share that it was a possibility and just tried to still push through.     Its not that they dont have empathy or have been lied to but maybe they think that if they knew beforehand that Upset leaving was a possibility they would have asked for Bean to share more scrim time or something even if it wouldnt have happened.
hm7fdsb,edgelordweeb_,11/26/2021,1,47.0,Bc orgs are gonna be willing to pay them a higher salary if the players agree to stay for a longer period of time. They want them on longer contracts so if theyre good the orgs just hold them and if they suck the org can just sell the contract anyways.
hm7zvhh,xHansi,11/26/2021,1,10.0,I just wanted other opinions...
hm85tzr,Happyfuntimeyay,11/26/2021,1,117.0,When ruining star trek isnt enough.
hm8la2l,-Basileus,11/26/2021,1,4.0,Its also pretty clear that  Yorick or Kalista werent there for example because they dont sell skins.  Hopefully Arcane makes the higher ups respect the importance of the lore.
hm8mffk,Jragon713,11/26/2021,1,177.0,They would never they paid Yorick a non-zero amount of attention somewhat recently with the maiden tower aggro change and the lie-about-hat Pentakill skin so its time to ignore him for years again.  And while Im ranting how crazy is it that his nemesis Viego shows up as the bad guy in two back-to-back events (Ruination and Pentakill) and Yorick has to just sit on the sidelines both times? Somehow the very out-of-place Pyke and Rengar get to be sentinels and Mordekaiser is the one to take on the guitar battle? Yorick will never again have any chances like this to take on his lore enemy but Riot doesnt care. reeee

He was in another country too so its not like hes gonna be the first to react.     It was a test to see his commitment to her and he failed. Now shes got him by the balls and hell grow bitter especially if he doesnt get to worlds again
hm7blf5,Melodias07,11/26/2021,1,87.0,Oh yeah i dont take soloQ performance that much. We had Cuzz player known to be always in top 10 but in stage he is more of a hit or miss type of player can drag team down easily.

hm8ooo8,The_Cool_Mule,11/26/2021,1,13.0,Theres too much damage so tanks are in a bad spot.  Okay pretty normal reddit complaints so far.  Theres way too much CC.  Wait isnt that what tanks do?  Theres too many overloaded and poorly designed kits like Aatrox Illaoi Kaisa Soraka and Wukong  Op really threw the darts at the board on this one. Btw the games player count keeps going up every year significantly. Your anecdotes about you and your friends dont apply to the entire playerbase. Turns out people like making flashy plays and having games be sub-30 minutes instead of long farmfests. Not that there isnt fun in long strategic games there is but those games are so tiring and most people dont feel like queueing up afterwards.
hm78izr,zetvajwake,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,The problem is that League of Legends isnt a regular job and Worlds isnt just another monday. By leaving Upset directly fucked with every single one of Fnatic players career money and general success. If I was Upset I would literally call my teammates every day apologize and give everything so I know they know there was no other solution but to leave. This was why Adam was mad. And then Upset came back and told Fnatic that he wants half the roster gone and they did that.

hm6yxm6,shitlord33,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,More likely he had more than 12 hours to write a response this time. Imagine reading something like that out of the blue and having people harass you and your loved ones all of a sudden its not surprising that what he wrote was a bit all over the place. Dude was probably very emotional and had to rush out a response
hm7efqq,challengemaster,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,To add to that - if this had been going on for two weeks as a personal matter that upset communicated to the team that just worsened when they were at worlds just about to play - why did FNC coaching staff / management not properly prepare with Bean. Two 10 minute scrims is not adequate from their part if there was ever a doubt about Upset being able to play.

(Then and now)  JG: Tarzan is also much better than Peanut who while has improved from his lows is not as good (relatively) as he was when he was on ROX. Tarzan was also a monster in 2019 and still is even now.  Mid: Chovy >=< Chovy  Bot: Ruler is fantastic but so is/was Viper (current world champ) and Viper was still very good and versatile in 2019 (Bot laner that could play mages very well at the time such as vlad)  Supp: GRF Lehends > HLE/AF Lehends. imo 2019 Lehends was better (relatively) then than he is now (HLE and AF werent as complete as 2019 GRF was that had threats in JG MID Bot  and also had better team fighting than DWG (GRF were DWG boogeyman before they imploded))

hm8nznq,Eragon_the_Huntsman,11/26/2021,1,564.0,As a kayle main I am a bit annoyed that they didnt keep iterating on the flight. The problem with the ability was it made her a god tier splitpusher since the moment anyone tried to rotate on her she could just fly out of the map and away or just over a wall and I agree that level 16 kayle should not be getting upgrades that incentivize avoiding fights. Still flight is such a core aspect to her theme that I wish they did more with it.  A while ago when I heard about it I was thinking about what they could have done with it (not that she needs anything right now shes very strong at the moment.) I though it would be cool if at level 16 she got a secondary range on her ult where if cast outside normal range she would channel for a moment then fly to her target to cast her ult pretty much like Galio. It would probably be crazy unbalanced but I think it would be an awesome way to get that guardian angel dropping from the sky to turn the tide feeling.
hm8oo0h,After_Signature_6580,11/26/2021,1,9.0,The account that gets all the gifts gets permabanned.  This has actually happened before. There was actually a case of it a few weeks ago.  Someone adds a stranger to their friends list. THey start playing games together. The stranger starts gifting the account skins. The money spent gets charged back. And the persons account gets permabanned.   People have also gotten banned the same way except the stranger emails Riot and says ________ has been boosting me for the last two weeks. Ive been gifting him skins as payment.  Repeat after me kids: you. are. responsible. for. your. own. account.  Not to mention Riot also uses that anti-cheat software that comes with the client. It runs in the background even when youre not playing League. So they know. It wont take long for them to figure out youre creating fraudulent Amazon accounts just for the Prime loot.

hm7dmr2,edgelordweeb_,11/26/2021,1,97.0,It was ultimately horrible for the internet but it was pretty fucking funny to watch it unfold in real time ngl. Also making satire of it really funny is really easy bc you dont actually have to satirize it just take shit that actually happened and pretend you made it up as satire and no one would know any better. Watching weirdly misogynistic rightoid gamers battle it out with weird idpol obsessed shitlibs over vidya was fucking hilarious and produced some of the greatest comedy of the decade in spite of its overall incredibly negative effects.

hm7b4pj,InvitemetoSkeet,11/26/2021,1,60.0,>DravenVarusKaiSaTristanaAshe and Kalista were all very very good with it in either SoloQpro play or both at the exact same time and only became worse after being directly nerfed by riot  Conq always outperformed soloq on Draven Draven was invisible in pro due to bans and picked to counter tristana. All onetricks think conq is better in soloq with hob outperforming in higher levels of play. Even then they dont agree as some always went conq. Soloq players went Conq such as ChadDraven Tyler1 PSZ while people that cared more for pro like JackSpektra and Arrow went for Hail of Blades. Asian Draven mains always went HOB. Draven did not get worse with it in soloq after HOB nerfs because more people stopped going that rune his wr actually increased. I know you are surprised but then you go on lolwiki and see that he was 110% bAD ratio on his Q so it actually makes sense.  Lethality Varus was the only way to play Varus so he is obviously going to take Hail of Blades. You Seriously thought lethality Varus was going to take precision runes? Other 3 were invisible last patch they werent bullying LT users like Twitch (I know your tumor in the head thinks HOB has higher winrate but thats AP twitch) Kog and Jinx.  >for all eternity even before the time that they were nerfed hmmf yes  Here are your words  Old Lethal Tempo had the problem of being hard outclassed by HoB on the big majority of its users with a few exceptions like Kog and Jinx  This is the contested point.  There is also this  Only thing that you are correct about HoB users not being all that goodbecause the current meta is dominanated by ADCs abusing lethal tempo  HOB users are not meta in the current meta because ADCs are abusing Lethal Tempo?  I refute this by saying they havent been meta for a while. I SPECIFICALLY used worlds as an example because  you are a dicksuck for probuilds. Pro players loved going HOB/Inspiration.  Like I said HOB was not meta in worlds what was being picked in worlds?  This was BEFORE more ravenous nerfs btw I am being nice to you by using this as an example.  Ziggs Aphelios Lucian Miss Fortune Jhin. 1 Lethal Tempo champ.  So here there are no  1. Oppressive Lethal Tempo champs bullying Hail of Blades users. 2. Hail of blades outclassing Lethal Tempo Lethal Tempo was actually represented more LOL.  None of the scenarios you talked about even occurred. You are in a fantasy land.  If you cant tell all of the ADCs outside of Aphelios were ult bots.  With MF doing less than 500 damage with kraken slayer.  I dont care about your moving goal posts dont bother replying you already agreed with me anyway see here:   >They were very good and only became bad after their direct nerfswhich were caused  There it is you called HOB champs bad in the context of a patch where new LT didnt exist.  Please dont embarrass yourself talking about ADCs [probuilds.com](https://probuilds.com) doesnt tell you everything.

hm6zvn5,Iperovic,11/26/2021,1,108.0,As much as people hate hearing this the only way to improve is to focus on yourself and look at what you could have done better to win  Yes its absolutely an unfair thing because sometimes it will mean youll literally have to 1 vs 9 or 2 vs 8/3 vs 7 with someone else which shouldnt be the case in a matchmade game but thats just the nature of 5 randoms teaming up  Take it from me as someone who peaked in GM I can steamroll through lower elo and no matter how garbage the other players in my team are up until like Dia IV Im certain I can basically 1 vs 9 just on pure mechanical skill and game knowledge  The moment you hit that dead-end of not knowing what else you could have done to win and just give up mentally means youve hit your peak elo  If your friend doesnt auto win any lane hes assigned to hes at the correct rank for his skill level and its only up to him to improve
hm724pu,FaeeLOL,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Im yet to hear somebody even speculate a reason that would not only warrant such an instant ditch from the climax of their pro careers but also have the reason be such sensitive that you can not share it with your teammates whose years of hard work your situation has flushed down the drain.  If there is an excellent reason to leave then sharing it seems obvious since the teammates would understand. To me it seems a weird contradiction that the reason is also of such sensitive nature that you cant say it even when not saying it comes with exact issues like this. Seriously please somebody come up with a reason that fits? Any death in the family does not even seem significant enough imo. If somebody has passed away your urgent presence there doesnt exactly fix the situation. And even then that should not be something you absolutely need to hide. It is legitimately hard to come up with a reason that fits both criteria of extreme importance to be there instantly AND of such sensitive nature that you cant say it.

hm6yi1j,Hawkock,11/26/2021,1,12.0,How long did something like this take you to paint?
hm7dah9,Sekkarai,11/26/2021,1,12.0,Fiddlesticks horror stories of his folklore around runeterra.  Noxus how they built the immortal bastion  Rise/fall of shurima  Targon  Three Sisters  Icathias Rebelion  Rune wars
hm7z3rn,ShinaMashir0,11/26/2021,1,1589.0,Arent you the sexist ? thats just your interpretation of the tweet
hm7cs3j,joker_mafia,11/26/2021,1,157.0,u can change region(for the most part) in lol without changing account its just not free xD
hm7ewfz,henluwu,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,Considering that both bwipo and adam publicly complained about the situation its safe to assume that these 2 meetings didnt actually clarify anything. I highly doubt 3 of 4 players would go against upset if they were sufficiently informed about what could happen.
hm730bu,Tittymotorboat,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Yes ive finally recovered from that based joke I heard. Thanks for asking.
hm6yry6,SkeletonJakk,11/26/2021,1,7.0,Sett isnt OP. Or broken. at all.
hm6yhox,Mrpettit,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,If Upset had stayed and played would anyone have been fucked besides Upset? His teammates wouldnt have been.
hm75did,Odd_Play_5769,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Then call them your coworkers not teammates. Teammates is something more than coworker. Were killing language so much that even people who speak the same language dont really agree on what anything means anymore. My 2 cents
hm8pp3d,Kaiseredd,11/26/2021,1,17.0,If Srtty gets a bit more exposure in academy I can see him replacing a bottom tier top player in less than 2 years.   Guy has the it factor. EG needs to polish him good NA top players are hard to find
hm7s3iu,uncertainrandompal,11/26/2021,1,124.0,i mean it’s just facts other detectives gave us before with match history of his smurf account
hm7jjjq,JayManty,11/26/2021,1,114.0,I played with a Shaco today as Sett he was getting ambushed in river by enemy jungle and mid but he was turning it around for a victory (enemy jg was 0/4). As soon as I arrived I did my full combo only to realise Shaco still at 90% HP left and began AFKing in the nearest bush. I was first time Sett and got my shit kicked in the enemy jungler got the kill I asked Shaco why did he leave.   Shaco: Calculated gold reset  That was the only thing he typed all game. I thought of just right-clicking the enemy fountain for a looooong time after that lmao
hm7e6lh,No_Principle_4593,11/26/2021,1,56.0,Have you ever worked in your life? Where I live I would get at the bare minimum a warning for missing a day of work without a solid reason. Saying not even his boss has a right to information is technically true but you would get fired for what he did without a death certificate of a close relative (aka direct family) to justify leaving like he did...
hm72y2g,Lothric43,11/26/2021,1,23.0,And nothing. Just answering a question.
hm8dvfn,meDeadly1990,11/26/2021,1,298.0,So after we had 2-3 hour login queues for a whole year you straight up wanted it back after the Server split that fixed the issue? Hard doubt
hm7gghl,Brain_Tonic,11/26/2021,1,144.0,Baseless conjecture stop assuming owners are nice.
hm7mfw8,Chroonyx,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Not that I disagree with you but these people live together work together eat all their meals together everyday for 4 months.   It’s not just 8-16 days as we would at work.
hm7tqzk,PedroLight,11/26/2021,1,120.0,I really enjoy your presence and understanding on bug threads thanks for existing :)
hm8leto,DodgerFntic94,11/26/2021,1,3.0,Without watching the video imma guess its because most people check the skin owned tab which removes these since they arent from skins but from the base
hm7uymh,FEAR_LORD_DUCK,11/26/2021,1,7737.0,>if she didnt immediately jump into his arms just have Powder open up to Silco without that and then have Silco empathize with and comfort her.  to me it seemed more like an angry tackle before she simply gave up and confided in the bad guy. Powder needed Vi but she had left and she believed she abandoned her. Especially after what she had done to her family it felt understandable for powder to jump in Silcos arms.  She was willing to confide in anybody who would listen to her and understand.
hm7dwyw,phranq,11/26/2021,1,,Just like Upset can not say what he wants. Adam can say what he wants. And everyone can form their own opinions with the knowledge they’ve been given.
hm7hcd9,Hazakurain,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,I see nothing on his Twitter. And I dont watch his stream but he was very pg with Nisqy when they did the tier list so I prone to believe the opposite
hm8sxcl,Brad3196,11/26/2021,1,,Ill check it out thanks
hm7k3s4,Tittymotorboat,11/26/2021,1,92.0,Im sure you have a girlfriend/boyfriend /r/AITA poster.
hm8d2oz,DogRabbitCat,11/26/2021,1,166.0,You shouldn’t need someone on Reddit to tell you this shit lmaooo it’s not an indie game
hm7hlkw,throwawaynumber116,11/26/2021,1,18.0,Idk I would have to test it. Ban like Jayce/Vlad/Veigar. After that it should be pretty okay
hm7uwv9,MapPotential9009,11/26/2021,1,243.0,You know you could just invade him lvl 1 and kill him with ease?
hm7ingw,killerlu45,11/26/2021,1,,Ssshhh no one must know
hm8b880,Jiffyyy,11/26/2021,1,150.0,im not blaming people for feeling bad about the situation its the stuff people try to make up to fill in the gaps of information they dont know. they simply need to accept its a shitty situation and move on its not their place to demand answers.
hm7o7kk,KawaiiMajinken,11/26/2021,1,120.0,Gatekeeping bug reports is probably not one of the things Id have expected to see in a thread. Ever.
hm7rsdf,Cordobra,11/26/2021,1,1.0,Got a link?
hm7ctjv,AlphaTenken,11/26/2021,1,39.0,Holy bad title. I was going to say Liquid WTH!! if they got both lol.
hm7389w,BigBadDogLol,11/26/2021,1,24.0,No the comments specifically “countering true damage” not “vaynes true damage specifically” man you need to READ the comment and what it’s responding to
hm871pw,zombtachi_uchiha,11/26/2021,1,12.0,Leena leave Doublelift...his ego is big as well

hm8meud,JoeBrow123,11/26/2021,1,1.0,i got it instantly
hm8dmtn,False_Passion295,11/26/2021,1,333.0,6 years and yall created a MASTERPIECE I just finished it today and WOW IM MINDBLOWN. Now i will live in my cave of a room for the next 6 weeks because my emotions are unstable right now and that is a good thing i guess.. it means that yall did a great job!!😭❤
hm7b3ov,Ok-Nature-4563,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,Literally 3/5 of FNC team are not on good terms with upset over what he did that’s all you really need to know that upset is a grub.   I agree with Doublelift you lose the right to privacy when you grind with a team all year to accomplish a single goal leaving just before the most important thing event in a league pros life with no explanation is unacceptable.
hm6zdc1,FantasyTrash,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,How is it a straw man? He is literally blaming Upset for circumstances that were not in his control.
hm7pne1,wotad,11/26/2021,1,89.0,I mean sure but these contracts just mean big buyouts so if you under perform or have a bad year then enjoy finding a team.
hm7cgdd,SnooChickens7571,11/26/2021,1,50.0,Being angey is different from publicaly speculatinf that he didnt have a good reason.

hm720j8,Yidaxir,11/26/2021,1,49.0,Dont worry like in game... /muteall! 😁
hm7i8cg,amroth6464,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,In what world Bwipo and Nisqy are against Upset ?  They just said they were kept in the dark.  Nobody from the team or the management defending him ? This thread is litterally about a fnatic manager posting to defend him. Prior to that Yamato defended him.  The others teamate just said they dunno what happened and that situation sucked. And yeah it really does.  Seems like you build some weird stories in your head then come on reddit and start shooting nonsense again and again.
hm8cied,Kadaj22,11/26/2021,1,3.0,I honestly can’t be done with playing normal or ranked. I just play TFT and the rotating game modes like URF and ultimate spell book.

hm71bfd,dabmin,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,i support his right to privacy and not having to tell anyone anything about his life but what could have possibly happened that needed to remain so private and under lock and key???
hm7j4or,steve_pays_me,11/26/2021,1,104.0,it must be nice to walk through life in a black and white world.  makes things super straightforward and easy.
hm7pec6,MVISCANp,11/26/2021,1,15.0,The Du Couteau family. Think it could be interesting to watch would also connect to Noxus vs Demacia.
hm7wovh,TargonBoi,11/26/2021,1,,Are you aware that there are already thousands of Eastern Europeans playing on EUW? There is barely any ping difference and EUW being the more prestigious one atracts a lot of people. Not to mention EUW is already full of flaming French EUW players are (in)famous for a reason.
hm8m3wx,SocialistScissors,11/26/2021,1,26.0,Pickrate doesnt matter when ego is taken into account. (ADC players wont play non-marksmen regardless of strength)
hm7ev62,edgelordweeb_,11/26/2021,1,97.0,I remember watching Big Brother for a few seasons and then it just got old. Everyone is trying to play themselves up to launch a post-Big Brother career and its kinda cringe. Its fun and funny for a while but after a few seasons I was so done man.
hm7g85h,Fgame,11/26/2021,1,1301.0,Like Ive said the rest of the teams anger is justified but taking it out on Upset is childish as fuck. Yamato knew what was going on and either a) didnt communicate to the team it was actually a serious issue or b) the team didnt care what Yamato said. Depending on which happened determines who really looks bad here. But Adam and Bwipo both look like stooges for insinuating Upset left worlds for a booty call or some shit.
hm7sbae,EmilianoR24,11/26/2021,1,5.0,Hopefully low elo players will learn how to deal with it by learning to fucking sidelane
hm7sz4h,FireDevil11,11/26/2021,1,144.0,Wouldnt help if he is still the one typing and from the post I am assuming he is the one typing.  Imo he should just full on disable it so he cant even type.
hm897g2,LeagueOfWeeb,11/26/2021,1,16.0,sweeper has a much lower cd than wards do do you even play this game?
hm810t1,Dondurand,11/26/2021,1,166.0,u/savevideo
hm7xxy1,vegeful,11/26/2021,1,,Make me realise the person you comment never face a corporate politic before. If he taste what Adam get i bet he sing a different tune.   Yes Upset deserve privacy but at least had some decency and moral. U already screw your team the least he can do is stay low and offer no comment on anything. Or at least protect your team. Not backstab them because Adam is below my standard.   If u are a normal guy its common sense to do that. Only asshole did what Upset did. Even if Upset had emergency the least he can do is be kind to his team.    In fact the cause and effect of Adam tweet is just because of Upset backstab. This tweet will never happen had Upset not backstab him.   If Adam an asshole and immature he will post it during world.
hm7zttp,Spicy_Pineapple_,11/26/2021,1,3.0,Smurf queue?
hm7cfbs,Reddit12btw,11/26/2021,1,39.0,The only thing inspired secured with that mentality while extending with RGE was ticked to NA.  Players that have real value should stop signing 2y+ contracts.  Imagine Hans was stupid enough and extended at the same time as larssen and inspired but im glad hes smarter than that.
hm7drz3,JamisonDouglas,11/26/2021,1,166.0,Thats absolutely fucking spot on hahaha. Makes me feel better to read that from someone else.
hm731sn,Hrkeol,11/26/2021,1,42.0,Get a life and stop being a bitter misogynistic. Its better for your will being.
hm8n8s2,IndepthGuides,11/26/2021,1,320.0,If it happens here is a biased guide by a dane who plays both servers:   If you see French or Spanish in champion select you have to dodge. Players from these countries from my experience arent worse or more toxic but the ones who refuse to speak English tend to be able to actually communicate and its an ego thing.   Romanian and Polish people:   Extremely overrated how toxic these two are from my experience but they do tend to limit test a lot(?) as in I see them go for the most outrageous plays. Maybe its a cultural thing but they are not afraid to fight lmao.   German people:   Depressed broken English even more broken German.   Arabia. (Mostly Egypt from my experience EUNE mostly.)   Sweaty tryhards yet always loses. Extremly bad mental the moment anything goes wrong. Cant play for scaling yet intstalocks Kassadin 90% of games but not toxic just bad mental.   The UK. Oi mate waer can I mid bruh Im not actually bad XD Im drunk and smoking W33d 420.   Sweden:   Their meatballs arent even seasoned ???   Denmark:   Turbo chad best sigma yoghurt male best gamers (not biased) top of all time best in world beat kr cn every worlds just giving them a chance lulu imagine lål æøåæøåæøæåæø
hm7cgwq,Rumbleinthejungle8,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,A family **emergency** is not something minor. The definition of an emergency is the complete opposite of something minor.   Why does it matter what the actual emergency is? I trust that it was a serious issue because it wasnt just Upset but Yammato and people from Fnatic management that agreed with him. Thats all that anyone needs to know. Who cares if its because his uncle is sick in the hospital or because his wife broke her leg?
hm6yv2t,LionePRO,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,fnc haters g2 fanbase who are saying shit like fnc management benching nisqy or [shit like this](https://twitter.com/Dintitan_G/status/1463914355016318984)
hm6yhok,SkeletonJakk,11/26/2021,1,24.0,Comparing 10% phys damage and 10% true damage is vastly different.  Cant build armour vs true damage.
hm88kar,Far-Abroad8185,11/26/2021,1,8.0,>Both teams will be drafting around synergy with soul point or just generally whatever buff the drake gives naturally.  Personally i think thats cool.
hm8184a,After_Signature_6580,11/26/2021,1,2.0,November 30th
hm7rrgi,Kurumi_Tokisaki,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Yeah some loud upset defenders seem to firmly believe management 100% did what’s needed but it seems the biggest issue was management not getting the message across  to players like Adam and Bwipo so that while it sucks ass for them at least they can be sorta understanding and maybe follow up on it when Adam dropped his twit
hm6y1u8,puma271,11/26/2021,1,74.0,Well ye dk wont get nuguri since he said he wont play maybe theshy but thats doubtfull +i wouldnt say theshy is s tier player - he had rather bad 2 years so he has to prove me wrong before i acknowaldge him  But ye geng isnt a super team they have s tier botlane and z tier mid but jungle and top are not regarded as s tier players  In fact i think that t1 is closer to super team than geng (although they arent one unless zeus and oner level up)
hm7p1wp,yonangks,11/26/2021,1,120.0,Excellent list I wish someone would make a similar one for Katarina. Ever since her rework in 2016 Im fairly sure shes also one of the most buggy characters in the game.
hm7si4b,SovereignType,11/26/2021,1,2.0,Its basically to distract Riots toddler playerbase from their sexual harrassment scandal lawsuits.
hm730yq,xgt99,11/26/2021,1,141.0,There is also quite a lot of beef and cool insults to throw to other countries tbh...  Also very easy to attack their country economy or historical events...
hm8qhjr,The_Cool_Mule,11/26/2021,1,13.0,Its not just a popular game its the most popular game in the world. Technically there are some Chinese games that have more players but theyre almost exclusively played in China. League is played everywhere. And again your personal anecdotes are meaningless against the rising player count. Its not stagnant its increasing in every region including NA. The game is already part of the culture in places like China and Korea. Its not going anywhere. You dont have to like League maybe its not for you anymore. But that doesnt make it a bad game or the current direction of the game wrong.

hm7edyl,DestinyMlGBro,11/26/2021,1,115.0,Good advice i got was you need to have 8.5cs a min with atleast 3 deaths avg across your games not inting but limit testing so that way you know what you can and cant do and how that effects your farming.
hm8layw,Clark-Kent-76,11/26/2021,1,3.0,That was nuts not gonna lie. Nice side steps
hm8qma9,bynature123,11/26/2021,1,2.0,There’s only 1 from twitch that you can get. 1 Arcane capsule but you get 2 chances to get it for the people that missed the premiere. The other capsule was from the Arcane X browser flash game thing.   If it says you have 2 claimed in your twitch inventory then that’s just a bug on twitch.

hm7e7vz,Btigeriz,11/26/2021,1,4459.0,Notice how people like Rich/Thorin havent said publicly the reason he left. Meanwhile you have Adam come out knowing absolutely nothing sending hate towards Upsets wife because hes butt hurt that Upset was asked his opinion on Alphari joining FNC.
hm87jd4,sleepy_as_fk,11/26/2021,1,175.0,CHILLS
hm6zaci,Cereaza,11/26/2021,1,83.0,G2 barely felt like G2 without Perkz. Now without Wunder it just... hits different.
hm701jx,puma271,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Well the only good way to handle it is to make your team feel that this was neccessary they didnt do that so they misshandled it - that seems clear - and obv everyone who doesnt fully trust upset (and upset doesnt fully trust them so it seems fair) felf like they werent  communicated clearly and was hurt - the only purpose of coaching and management staff in this case is to make the team feel the opposite... - there is no entitlement here 5 people have commuted entire year to one goal and one of them dodges with bearly any explanation - you do deserve some explenation if not from upset then at least coaching staff  management to rnsure that players understand the urgancy - and since they didnt either upset or management or coaching staff failed in passing info along
hm85puz,WelcomeToTrollTown,11/26/2021,1,92.0,Does jungle really get flamed more than other roles?
hm7g67e,amroth6464,11/26/2021,1,1301.0,Upset absolutely didnt say that.  Its adam resuming a probably 1hour long conversation by that. He litterally said he let me understand im not up to his standards.  What he said was probably far from that harsh. And seeing how bitter adam is about that alphari situation It was probably not insulting at all.
hm81qod,Pintulus,11/26/2021,1,103.0,Wouldnt suprise me at all if the mental boomed considering how their spring (reverse sweeped) summer (choked in playoffs) and worlds went and just doesnt want to play together anymore.

hm8po0t,infinityoncorktree,11/26/2021,1,3.0,Its a grind for sure but its better than the old system. Best way right now is to buy an XP boost and play a bunch. Next time they do a pass buy that and use all your pass points on random champion shards!

hm7x11t,Karpeeezy,11/26/2021,1,103.0,And in 1990 it hit its low of 47% against the current 59% in 2020. Still a long way to go for anything to change and as long as theyre the #1 market (and they are by a huge margin) their money is going to go a long way.
hm73mde,throwawaynumber116,11/26/2021,1,85.0,Idc about gamergate but that shit sounds hilarious.
hm6z6zq,f0xy713,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,It is absolutely within his rights but this is the kind of reason I would give to complete strangers (AKA my fans) not my teammates. The fact that you only trust a single teammate and your coach enough to disclose more details than family emergency seems kind of insane to me.  So yeah to me both sides are at fault here - Adam for lashing out and Upset for not being able to trust his teammates enough to give a better reason why hes ruining their chances at Worlds. Adam might never make Worlds again so its completely understandable that hes upset.  Hyli is a bro for not wanting to know the reason but hes also the best player on that lineup who already had good Worlds runs in his career so its probably not as big of a deal for him.

hm70dtg,Laheeee,11/26/2021,1,141.0,Ive used to play a lot on both and totally agree. I feel like toxicity and competition are related KR is also (if not even more) toxic. EUNE is not that competitive
hm83qmc,Earth-Red,11/26/2021,1,291.0,Eune has just as much English speaking as euw. The Nordic countries for instance are faring a lot better in English than say France Germany or Spain.
hm8isy9,JukebocksTV,11/26/2021,1,26.0,Youre getting very emotional about this. The truth is you will probably never reach a high enough elo for any of this to matter to you.  It sounds to me like you lost one game to a vayne who got a lead and now your conclusion is that the champion is not balanced. This is not how high level players think.
hm6y29c,mi-0-0,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,So what does it indicate?
hm731az,CoogiMonster,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Fair enough. At the end of the day you can’t say a whole lot as management anyway.  Their hands are mostly tied because they have to respect players and so I trust the players takes on this a little more.  I’m also surprised how much these players don’t seem to like/trust each other.  I haven’t been on a team in anything sport related in a while but even the players I didn’t trust I respected enough to be upfront with them so from the jump this has all seemed odd.

hm8sbk4,De-Lit,11/26/2021,1,8.0,Ah yeah in that case I would go for the most expensive one as your free champ as it will save you time and materials as you play more. It might be one time but saving 7k essence now is a few levels later one when it takes a bit more time
hm7e32a,mrmorzan,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,From my perspective Adam Upset and Fnatic management all come off badly in this.  Adam made a post that directed angry fans toward upset and fueled speculation on a topic that was starting to die down.  Upset is either lying or terrible at communicating given that 3/4 of his teammates seem unhappy with how he handled his departure and how he acted after returning. Yes he was in an awful situation. Doesnt change the fact he is still partially responsible for anything that went wrong due to him being absent.   Fnatic management seems to be the only ones given full information and they failed to convey the seriousness of Upsets situation to the rest of the team.   Also informing Adam that Upset was involved in the recruiting process was incredibly stupid. Anyone should be able to see how awful it is from Adam and Nisqys perspective to have the person who was absent during worlds be responsible for deciding if they should be replaced. Either leave him out of the process entirely or keep the fact that he was involved under wraps.

hm6zr2o,Intensolo,11/26/2021,1,93.0,Udyr hecarim and olaf all taught jungle fundamentals and how if you establish a win con and play to it you can win every game its just a matter of refining that process from there.  Shaco taught me how to solo carry games and make myself the win con it also taught me how to adapt my build to suit my champion identity that game (assassin/dueler/zone control). Shaco also taught me how to think ahead to find a moment when the enemy either jgl or laner is vulnerable and exploit it.   Rek sai taught me how to gank correctly a lot of ganks are can result in nothing or only summs if your micro and champion tethering is sub-par.

Im talking about Juggernauts specifically.  Mind you 16/17 of the divers which are the less tankier bruisers can utilize Thornmail at its fulf potential.  In comparison 9/14 of the juggernauts can.  I am taking every potential CC for this so even Shyvanas R or Trundles pillar is counted for this aswell as lets say Rengar empowered Bolas.  Its especially surprising it works this way when Fimbulwinter has a specific clause that indicates that melee champions can activate the passive with slows aswell not just immobilizing controls.  NB : I see this FBI flair so much on this Reddit it feels like I know you xD

hm70gz4,-LostInCloud-,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,To anyone that has compassion and 3 braincells this should have been obvious:   Of course its neccessary that Upset leaves otherwise he would have not missed it.
hm709gy,KonanTenshi,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,It’s pretty obvious that whatever reason upset left for he doesn’t think that everyone (at least on his team) will agree that it is justified for him to leave.

hm814hq,NiixxJr,11/26/2021,1,569.0,I agree. As a Renekton player Teemo was a rough matchup...

hm834gc,castrozaka,11/26/2021,1,92.0,why not? No one takes NA seriously even in its own playerbase. Im not trying to be too antagonistic but it feels like these feat AMA posts are mostly from NA nowadays. It gives the impression people dont do the biggest feats anywhere near as often on EUW because of the skill disparity.  The term big fish in a normal pond applies no?

I cant speak for you personally but people will choose family over their job if something devastating enough to leave the team happens.  you are no different than the rest speculating because you dont know the truth but want to keep prying away to get it and will attack him because you want answers you are not entitled to.

hm8nphk,Initial_Length6140,11/26/2021,1,29.0,Ima hope youre joking  but just in case you arent.  Pick rate does matter when looking at win percentage. A sol has been hovering a 53% win rate for 2 years now... does that mean hes broken? Of course not if you look at his play rate its stupidly low and you realize that the reason a sol has a high win rate is due to him only being played by one tricks. While a 2% pick rate is pretty average and swain does need a small nerf that doesnt mean hes broken. If you look at swain players who pilot him into ranked you realize most of them get shit on bc you cant just keyboard smash on him.
hm8mjph,Pileae,11/26/2021,1,174.0,Can you elaborate? My understanding of attack-move is that itll have you autoattack what your champ is nearest to. Does it autoattack whatever is closest to the cursor?

Like if I say Enkenz gf should just stay in the kitchen instead of on twitter then even if its obvious I am not saying it seriously there will be tons of people who seriously echo that sentiment.   I dont even think Upset was in the right in how he handled it but there has been too much hate thrown his wifes way. If its only thrown at him it sucks but he is a public figure. His wife isnt a pro and shouldnt be even mentioned by other figures unless they want them to rain hate on her.

hm82dhe,DomFreecss,11/26/2021,1,85.0,Adc right now are so weak because games end so fast. Also its the only role  that you can get solod by literally any champ in the game. It was my secondary role for years but its just so unfun to play now.
hm7uqyo,MapPotential9009,11/26/2021,1,243.0,Pretty much. Unless you play an AD Assassin Riot doesnt care about you. Playing Ivern is troll at this point and is hindering your own team. Such a shame that Riot wont address Iverns issues.

hm7l5nq,jixxor,11/26/2021,1,555.0,Ever since season 12/ pre season started my game is stuttering like crazy for the first 60-70 seconds on Summoners Rift (havent yet played any other mode). Basically it is 1-3 second screen freezes every 5-10 seconds. The FPS before the freezes start is stable 144 then after the freeze ends the FPS counter jumps to 40\~ and immediately back up to 144 where it stays until the next freeze. I did the client repair and re-installation both had no effect. Windows and drivers up to date no other game having issues League also had no issues before the pre-season patch.  Does anyone have any clue as to what is going on?

The implication being that as he wasn’t kicked out he must have given a proper explanation?  I’d also like to re-emphasise that my example would be the same whether it was the quietest time of the year or the busiest. Life doesn’t stop happening when you hit critical moments at work.  Equally if my colleagues who were left working after I’d left threw a fit and sulked rather than professionally doing their best *they* would be the ones more likely to be forced out for a lack of professionalism.

Edit: the comment I’m referring to said you can’t build against true damage like your can do physical with armor. I said you can counter both with health items as both will be as effective against both types and even magic. This wasn’t SPECIFICALLY FOR VAYNE. Also to beat vayne you lower attack speed and hp will also work but not as much vs most true damage
hm7jvl5,Miyaor,11/26/2021,1,,Upset leaving without telling them is also not decent.  He has basis though. Its literally what he was told.  I will say Adam posting it definitely wasnt the nice thing to do. I am defending him doing it because I dont see it as any worse than what Upset did and I hold Upset at fault for the full thing. Do you think Upset didnt know what would happen to his teammates if he left them like that? He obviously knew it was important to tell the teammate he liked which is the only teammate who doesnt dislike him now.   I dont think what Adam did was a nice thing or that it should really be commended. I just fully understand why he did it and think his anger is fully justified. I also think Upset is at fault and blaming Adam for posting this ignores the first half which would have prevented all of this in the first place.
hm6z3pv,DickerDave,11/26/2021,1,83.0,Hes at KCorp
hm7q62t,AlphaTenken,11/26/2021,1,551.0,Thats actually beyond funny
hm707mg,xavyarog1,11/26/2021,1,73.0,What do you think about Zhuo?? I think he had potential but idk if hes good enough for a star studded roster.
hm8ow9k,FCalamity,11/26/2021,1,4457.0,Exactly. My take is that people including Upset are conflating its his right to prioritize his family and not share private info (true) with therefore he should be free of any negative consequences for doing so (false).  Given that he hasnt provided a full public explanation he should honestly count himself lucky that literally anyone in pro LoL is willing to work with him at all. Who wants to risk their chance at worlds on something-they-dont-even-know-what-it-is happening again? Upsets very good but hes not THAT good.  And speaking of its his right is it not also Adams right to discuss a situation publicly?
hm72x65,SecretIlliad97,11/26/2021,1,4.0,how is it still down wtf?? i just want to gift some skins man :(
hm88xsh,Luciforreal,11/26/2021,1,110.0,What does BDS stand for?
hm715yn,Migraine-,11/26/2021,1,42.0,> This is the problem when you arent at least a little forthcoming...  Lol shut the fuck up you child.  Nobody has a right to information he doesnt want to share. Nobody. Not the community not his teammates not even his boss.  Him not sharing does not give anyone the right to start making up rumours.  Your attitude is absolutely disgusting.
hm7pu0q,vegeful,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,If i screw up a big project and its hurt your company brand the less i can do is to be quiet and stay low. If management ask just say no opinion. At least your team deserve some mercy after the setback.  But he say Adam did not reach my ambition. This already make me dislike his personality. It come of as Jerk guy and very selfish.
hm7kba3,zUkUu,11/26/2021,1,540.0,Vis charged Q initially had like double the range but rooted her. lmao
hm7czrj,Lifodd,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,no one even knows what the fuck that is and it has no influence on society. twitter has.

Apparently every fucking one that appears to know the full details sides with Upset and FNC even people notoriously known for hating Fnatic and its management.

hm727wi,jaguar317,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,They are allowed to be frustrated but to publicly bash him (and direct a shit ton of hate in his direction) as Adam did when you know that Upset is going through a hard time is the biggest douche move I have ever seen.

hm7zlm8,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,55.0,Thank you! College eports is definitely still new and growing a lot. I really like where its going with teams popping up left and right. I think therell be lots of pros and cons every year but overall its a good experience.
hm72cip,Zerwurster,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,> but the guys who got him there deserve an explanation  Well they got it now if it wasnt communicated clearly before: Emergency in the family please respect my privacy.  Upset has been working closely for months with his teammates and still thinks he cant trust them with such sensitive details. Maybe they warrant this kind of mistrust? Like bwipo having no filter for sharing... well just about any kind of information or like adam being a heated defiant teenager?  They deserve more details! No they dont and their behavior shows as much.
hm80x1u,Kripperino_Pasterino,11/26/2021,1,110.0,> People just see the scoreline & think it was close.  Funnily enough you just seem to remeber the Fiora at the nexus instead of the rest of game 1 & 2.  >  KT vs IG was IGs closest series by far. I think IG stomped every other series.  The other poster is absolute right even if IG wouldve couldve 3-0 the games were way more competetive than FNCs or G2. Ive given up to argue whether that meant that KT was better than / would beat G2/FNC but I always disliked shrugging off KT having a competetive series with IG as 1 auto from 3-0
hm7uixu,Identical64,11/26/2021,1,1.0,Is this a case where you can provide evidence of the enemy team being ahead or close with bounties or is this anecdotal and you only think the game was close. Players aren’t the best at figuring out gold leads IMO.
hm7a147,Falsus,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,I wouldnt be surprised if Ocelote rather paid his salary for another year than sell him to FNC. Or at the very least quadruple the BO price.
hm849xk,TH3RM4L33,11/26/2021,1,159.0,Uhh could you elaborate?
hm7y12c,BakaOfTheHunt,11/26/2021,1,23.0,I didnt watch CK much but I gotta imagine Keria and Guma would still have a easy lane against them right? Or where they actually that good in CK?
hm8m8fy,Qew-,11/26/2021,1,2.0,I have awareness for it. Thats why I gank top lane ans watch my bot suffer. 😎
hm7n9zq,uncertainrandompal,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,sure buddy “needed my immediate attention” and played this whole day and days later as well arams with his wife.   yamato said he didn’t know the reason as well in time of this event.   this whole post is exactly what expected from him as damage control - nothing new.
hm7utho,hearthwave,11/26/2021,1,30.0,shaco is sad
hm6y3yz,ArsenixShirogon,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Yeah Upset offered Hyli more details but Hyli trusted Upset that it was important and told Upset there wasnt a need for further elaboration
hm7ugn2,MapPotential9009,11/26/2021,1,243.0,Pretty much. Hes a forgotten champion that will never see a rise in play because Riot simply doesnt like niche characters. They would rather everyone play assassins
hm6z78y,maribri6,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Yes he did. A bad performance at worlds decreases the chance for players to go to good teams. Both Bwipo and Adam are going to teams that are worse than FNC and Nisqy doesnt even have a team next year.  No just saying emergency isnt enough for most people cause why would they trust you if you dont trust them. Therefore its managements job to make sure reactions like that dont happen. How do you not get it? Managements job (I include coach in management) is to take care of players and also make sure they dont do dumb shit. At least thats how it works in all sports except at FNC apparently...
hm86th2,lostn,11/26/2021,1,54.0,we know who got the best of whom in 2018 worlds.
hm7cc7u,MyHeartsMistakes,11/26/2021,1,523.0,That’s literally what I just said? They commenter above said “cries in Samira and Gwen” originally so I was asking why he thought Gwen W was a windwall.

hm861p1,Tuft64,11/26/2021,1,11.0,I mean if you want to call a team filled with some of the best academy talent from the last two years a bunch of nobodies and hate on your own team then thats your prerogative but personally I think this team is way more exciting than last years where every player was thrown together without much thought being given to team identity with no focus on development while expecting a handful of solid players to somehow perform at the level that they did in their prime under a rookie head coach.
hm7wlix,MapPotential9009,11/26/2021,1,246.0,Im sure theyre aware of the issue they just dont care about Ivern because he isnt played much and doesnt sell skins.
hm7ww43,Adventurous-Sport-45,11/26/2021,1,,Still I have also heard some theories suggesting that she might bear some relationship with Leona. Mel has an inordinate amount of sun imagery in her design and the scenes that she is in and her mothers name sounds a bit like the Amharic word for lioness.
hm7kbrm,NUFC9RW,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,No offense to him but so many people have to keep working through family members dying. I had a family member pass when I was in the middle of exams away from home in my first year of university and had to continue to the end of the exam period but Im sure others have gone through worse. The public dont need to know but his teammates careers were affected and they deserve to know more than family emergency.
hm7du7i,phranq,11/26/2021,1,,Cool story. I said people are free to think what they want. He isn’t free of the consequence of people forming opinions about him.
hm78obv,Kierenshep,11/26/2021,1,518.0,The best part of this is that Sunfires used to stack so youd go all tanks or all invisible Champs (evelynn used to be permanently invisible even next to champions and twitch was pretty much permanently invisible with q max) and just sit on the enemy til they died.  It was hilarious as eve because you did like 200 damage / second just sitting on someone with like 4 Sunfires. I still remember being in top lane and walking with this poor sap whos health just kept draining and draining until he died. Sucker.   5 tanks was hilarious because you now had like 150 dps * 5 meatshields = 700 dps in this clumped meatball. Teams melted. And since the only way to beat that was to split push fortify / teleport shored up that weakness.   Was disgustingly fun
hm7764s,pinkspott,11/26/2021,1,2.0,Paging u/Caenen_ for help here (if theyd be so gracious as to bless me with their presence).

hm7kaux,Tittymotorboat,11/26/2021,1,,>The question is why is your first idea.  Because Upset is a hot stud and I am sure hes been slaying Icelandic chicks all year. Now thats projection because its me im a 10/10 irl 200lbcs 185cm.  What about you chinlet? Post a picture of your chin I dare you.

hm7uc9b,Young_Khalifa,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Oh but you can.  At the end of the day esports is a business. Treating teams like something more is foolish and naive. They aren’t friends or brothers just teammates and coworkers. If you think someone would be better at a job especially when we’re talking about a job with only 5 spots for players its in your best interest to get the best player.  Does Upset have the moral high ground? Probably not but that’s pretty irrelevant given its a business decision the kind of thing that happens all the time in other fields of work.

Who knows that Upsets wife went through? She could have been through any number of tragedies. This isnt the time to be a braindead gamer who just shit tweets about her.
hm7wqa1,xkap,11/26/2021,1,1589.0,Its not about friendship. Its about not being an asshole. Being unhappy with your team is fine. Trying to push roster changes behind your teammates backs is not.

Im a jungle main and dont like playing against kayn at all but when I play him I feel like he doesnt have much impact compared to other junglers. For me it just comes down to how annoying he is but less of it determining the outcome of the game.

hm83kg2,LazerFruit,11/26/2021,1,13.0,2 games a week is equal 104 games in a year. You can pretty easily hit gold in that amount of games if your near that level and actually improving. Its even possible to hit plat provided your improving enough each game. However 104 is very few games and thats not taking into account that the ranked season doesnt last the whole year so realistically you have even fewer games and considering you are casual your probably not watching things like vods and high level streams so unless you are already at that level then its pretty unrealistic to climb much higher than what your current skill level would be

hm7giwm,FrostyPoot,11/26/2021,1,1301.0,Real life? These players frontload their entire livelihood into their careers theyre intertwined...  Most of these players only have 1 chance at worlds dont diminish its importance by claiming its just a job and theyre just coworkers because theyre not.   &#x200B  The entire point that most people are making is that Adams POV is mostly defendable. His speculation was very dumb but the rest of his point makes a lot of sense. If you fuck over your teammates you dont have to tell them why but you need to make it clear to ALL of them how important it is that you have to leave. Ditching without a word to them yourself then kicking them off the team shows 0 respect.   &#x200B  And to all the people claiming that Adam posting this proves that he wasnt to be trusted feels silly. Does anyone think Adam would have posted anything like this if Upset had sat down and told him how serious it was? I absolutely dont. Seeing someone react negatively after you wrong them (in Adams POV) doesnt prove they werent to be trusted...

He doesnt have to let the public know but the guys who got him there deserve an explanation
hm82pgb,bns18js,11/26/2021,1,55.0,Its not what they want to hear. Its just the truth. Support is still the least played by far globally. If nothing else we know for sure statistically we have the least amount of total players in the support position and it is autofilled the most. On top of that people who play support are the least competitive. Like if people get your mom/dad/girlfriend/boyfriend(who arent hardcore gamers) to play the game with them what is the role they gravitate towards by far? Its support. These combined means support mains has the least amount of competition to go up against and climbing in that position is the easiest.   And the above is true even if we assume support is as hard to play as the other roles which its not. Basically everyone(not just DOPA lol) agrees supports are by far the worst mechanically. Their champions do not need high precision nor high speed to function. They dont have to last hit and contest enemy laners at the same time(do not tell me last hitting is easy you have to do it while PvPing too. there is a reason chovys CS numbers are not attainable by everyone even at the pro level). There is some decision making to be made but its not any harder than jungle or mid. The vastly easier mechanical requirements still put it at the easiest.  Nobody is saying a gold Yasuo main deserves D1/masters. But its quite possible that a mid diamond Yasuo main can do it if they switched to support. But D1/masters support mains(esp enchanters) likely cannot even stay at mid diamond if they switched to yasuo. Support mains are simply the worst compared to others at the same elo.

hm7muha,c9haiondrugs,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,How is it pathetic? He not only abandoned him for cloudy reason thats can be respected but after doing so he talked down on him and tried to get rid of him from the roster? Imagine someone misses work beacuse of an emergency so you pick up their slack for the next 2 weeks and when they return they want to replace you.  &#x200B  Petty is a matter of perspective.
hm7mz2c,TheSilenceMEh,11/26/2021,1,44.0,Yah 2015 PAX really scaled down the LoL  representation compared to previous years. I think 2013 was the best representation of League at PAX. You had NA qualifiers Dominion booth with Phreak shout casting and Teemo hats everywhere.   In 2015 I remember being in line for Halo 5 and hearing that Faker was there and leaving the line to take a look. I think they chose people from the crowd to play a game with him was really cool.

hm7t9s6,TH3RM4L33,11/26/2021,1,120.0,I know what youre talking about it happens to everyone but its not a bug. Its usually caused by using R while basic attacking which cancels the stealth right away so you just have to be mindful about it.
hm7me44,OppaiTaichou,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,youre just an idiot lol. is it that hard to tell someone you dont want to play with them anymore? lol.     cant be talking about winning and financial gain when you abandon a team 12hours before the start of the biggest tourney and at the same time plotting to replace one of your teammate without actually telling him in his face.
hm78v4z,HemoTalon,11/26/2021,1,108.0,I will say older accounts that have been stuck in lower elos find it incredibly hard to get past where they have been for a few seasons Ive been playing for a long time like 2010 and have been bronze to silver the entire time I took a two year break a few years ago came back and got gold but I needed to have a %70 win rate because my MMR was soo unbelievably fucking terrible and thats just unfair. This year I didnt make it back to gold cause I have had other issues but even so I was at 150 games and %60 win rate stuck in S1/S2 for over 70 games.
hm8ktwf,Amsement,11/26/2021,1,187.0,Hes hit Masters in Korea so idk where you get this gold player stuff from.   Hes criticized Jensens proview yes but he criticizes anything he thinks is bad play and compliments good play when he sees it. Its not as if LS has it out for Jensen or something.  [His criticisms of Jensen have primarily been in laning.](https://youtu.be/py9uQ5zYf0I?t=718)  But this is also his criticism of most western mid laners when he compared them to eastern ones at worlds.   LS gave his thoughts on Jensen not playing [here](https://youtu.be/r6XahZDXoYA?t=2524) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4e3cgTIoD0&ab_channel=LeagueofLoL).  I would say that its pretty clear his stance is that its not worthwhile paying the large sum teams would have to pay to get him when there are other options that do not cost as much. That doesnt mean Jensen is bad or that he thinks Jensen is bad. I dont know what his thoughts on Jensen are from previous years but I would say that this is a fair statement to make based off of how Jensen performed this year overall.
hm8t10d,barub,11/26/2021,1,182.0,Any tips on how to help the jg?
hm7sec0,IWouldLikeAName,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,And if you think Upset would leave worlds after trying so hard for years for something miniscule then youre beyond stupid.   Could Upset and FNC hace handled it better? Of course. But at the end of the day Adam is just being an immature teenager.   Being mad about the situation is completely normal. But hes overstepped his bounds.
hm7mivl,FuujinSama,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,I was always hopeful about Adam maturing and at least starting to play normal champs before the meta turned. No Graves Awful Kennen at worlds is not legal and his Jayce was pretty terrible. And I understand that Upset was not there and everyone was tilted so Id 100% be all for Adam another year. Let him mature at FNC. Caps first split was pretty mild (much better than Adam imo but not *Caps*.)  However he always had a few takes that people found funny and I just found kinda disrespectful. Like how he didnt know the playoff format and thought they couldnt play finals. Or the multiple times he implied he didnt really care about preparation and just played his own game. It just stroke me as fairly immature and unprofessional.  And some pros are like that and its okay Im sure there are pros like that and they can be successful with the right team but I can also see how these things might rub players like Bwipo Hyli and Upset the wrong way. These are all players known for going very hard into preparation stats and the tactical side of the game and Adam gave the feeling that he just wanted to lock in a bruiser top and go at it.

hm74285,Rektile7,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Its a 2 way street he told them fuck all why should they trust that he had a legit reason?

hm7yldk,ap0st,11/26/2021,1,130.0,You are absolutely not entitled to the details of your coworkers family emergency. Are you literally 14?
hm7hzid,Miyaor,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,Why not? What takes that right from them?  He said what he heard. If he had been told the truth or atleast give some more information then I woulda agree with you.  He was frustrated about not finding answers. He literally didnt know it was that serious and neither did Bwipo or Nisqy. It wasnt just him who was completely confused about the situation.
hm7acdy,Salvage570,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,You be an emotionally immature league of legends pro whose life is dedicated to the game to the a degree they cant understand how something could ever take precedent over it Id assume
hm7g9fw,Kaztiell,11/26/2021,1,1301.0,it is illegal to say some stuff Ive read people say about Upset / his girlfriend in some countries yes atleast in the country Im from. I guess youre from a country where its not illegal and tahts why you think its such a funny comment?
hm8o29k,tanezuki,11/26/2021,1,,How does it makes sense then tell me with facts rather than just : its made this way and thats it.
hm6yk1h,KnitCat99,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,I still feel that the drama could have been drastically reduced if he had commnicated better with his teammates especially Bwipo and Adam. Yes I understand that things have to stay private at times but he obviously failed to bring any kind of support to the team.
hm76pgs,Vantablack9,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Yeah it seems like they werent clear enough about how Upset situation was justified and they were behind him. But if Fnatic was clear enough (which I doubt tbh) with everyone without revealing details then honestly looks pretty bad on Adams side.

hm7u9n5,PorkChopALaMolotov,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,>So yes we can respect not feeling good or family emergency but it does raise some eyebrows and if you want to keep it private you need to do it in a way that comes off sincere to the people who put their trust in you.  The org and the coach who knew more chose to trust him and bet on him again this year. Hilly chose to blindly trust him.   Its a few people who think they should have been told more because *they* dont trust everyone else judgment.   And its their right to do so and choose not to work with them again but taking things to the public wont ever help.
hm822jx,studiousAmbrose,11/26/2021,1,55.0,How does the mid meta look during preseason? Whats strong and what do you think will probably continue to be strong once s12 starts?
hm7f6o6,xCammo,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,So you are actually thinking that Adam saying publicly on twitter idk why he left so as far as Im concerned Im gonna say his wife felt lonely and he went back to her. Is it true? I dont care is appropriate.  Really fucking wish youd re-evaluate your thoughts.
hm7c8cw,Angry---train,11/26/2021,1,60.0,> Conq always outperformed soloq on Draven Draven was invisible in pro due to bans and picked to counter tristana. All onetricks think conq is better in soloq with hob outperforming in higher levels of play. Even then they dont agree as some always went conq. Soloq players went Conq such as ChadDraven Tyler1 PSZ while people that cared more for pro like JackSpektra and Arrow went for Hail of Blades. Asian Draven mains always went HOB. Draven did not get worse with it in soloq after HOB nerfs because more people stopped going that rune his wr actually increased. I know you are surprised but then you go on lolwiki and see that he was 110% bAD ratio on his Q so it actually makes sense.   HoB quite literally always outperformed pissqueror on him in terms of winrate because conqueror is an awful terrible runeespecially for ranged champions like him which take a decade to stack it and dont even get good benefits from the small amounts of stacks  >Lethality Varus was the only way to play Varus so he is obviously going to take Hail of Blades. You Seriously thought lethality Varus was going to take precision runes? Other 3 were invisible last patch they werent bullying LT users like Twitch (I know your tumor in the head thinks HOB has higher winrate but thats AP twitch) Kog and Jinx.   His lethality build had a piss shit winrate in comparison to his on hit one yet HoB remained way higher in terms of power because you dont lose your rune by trying to poke the enemy team the same way you do with lethal tempo  AP twitch is a shit tier pick thats played once for every 100 AD twitch games.  I get that the fungal growths are making you unable to see it but enormous majority of those HoB games are AD twitch with it being deflated further down by the awful AP build   >Here are your words  >Old Lethal Tempo had the problem of being hard outclassed by HoB on the big majority of its users with a few exceptions like Kog and Jinx  >This is the contested point.  >There is also this  >Only thing that you are correct about HoB users not being all that goodbecause the current meta is dominanated by ADCs abusing lethal tempo  >HOB users are not meta in the current meta because ADCs are abusing Lethal Tempo?    HoB ADCs arent meta because they either got nerfed or switched to abusing lethal tempo which can be very very blatantly seen with shit like Draven and Ashe going up while using lethal tempo which they previously completely ignored  >I refute this by saying they havent been meta for a while. I SPECIFICALLY used worlds as an example because you are a dicksuck for probuilds. Pro players loved going HOB/Inspiration.  >Like I said HOB was not meta in worlds what was being picked in worlds?   >HoB is massively overrepresented  >HoB users get nerfed  >less HoB users in pro  >actually HoB is terrible and bad
hm75inm,DrawDecoder,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Upset probably thought he was being transparent but in reality didn’t communicate it well with his teammates at all.  If multiple FNC players feel slighted by Upset then it really does bring into question the way Upset himself has handled this situation legitimate as his issues may be.

Steps:  - Get Oracle Lens  - Obtain eye of the herald  - Summon it anywhere  - immediately use oracle lens after rift herald channel  - done
hm7na2i,ice_wallow_qhum,11/26/2021,1,4.0,Well part of the game is destroying towers so it alwaus is a goal and it would always be your goal to defend them
hm7h1b6,I_am_not_Serabia,11/26/2021,1,1301.0,Some people here are like:  Upset? Leave him alone hes got family issues.  The rest of the team? Fuck them upset got family issues.  Why is it so hard to understand that the whole team got fked by the situation. Sure people should be angry how adam decided to handle the whole stuff but they shouldnt be surprised and angry that his is mad. Really you all guys are so much supportive and all but if something happened to you and everything you worked on went straight to the trash bin you also wouldnt be pleased and would like to at least understand why.

If we really want to look into history then all I can say is to not call someone who on average is Platinum-Diamond if you got your Silver rank with 3 wins and 7 defeats.  I will still gonna shitting on your post because I never look at the username but only at what its in that post (and I really dont want to waste energy on remember your username and avoid it).

hm74esu,DomiekNSFW,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,A perfect example of Upsets concerns is the murder of Doublelifts mom. Years later people still make jokes about her getting stabbed and nickname Doublelift based on some anime where the character faced a similar experience.  I have no idea if Upset handled this matter with his teammates in a good way but I absolutely support the notion that teammates/coworkers are not entitled to know the details of your private life. Especially with the potential for a leak to millions of people.

hm8erbr,hpl2000,11/26/2021,1,121.0,Maybe in iron. Above that people at least have a basic idea of the game in my experience. Idk I don’t touch ranked it’s the shittiest game mode plus I’d probably get banned for the champs I play lol.
hm71ooq,Daimonfire,11/26/2021,1,133.0,Can I say I absolutely love Acapella. Here is no exception. This was absolutely wonderful. I just dont think the mood captured here fits the show/opening.
hm76h64,Lambisexual,11/26/2021,1,23.0,Whats wrong is that unlike literally every other objective in the game (Baron and Elder included) its a literal game ender by merely possessing it. Its just not fun at all nor do you rarely get rewarded for playing well against an enemy with said soul. Because they will just revive and most likely get a revenge kill. One time we killed a fed enemy Katarina first thing in a teamfight she got revived and then got a quadra kill because most of our stuff we used to catch her was on cooldown.   Baron and Elder are meant to be game enders. However they are both timed and its not always an insta win by just possessing them. You can play smartly around it and try and stall until it runs out. Chemtech soul has no cooldown and it will remain for the entire duration of the game. Theres really not much you can do against it. You just have to win every teamfight twice.
hm6z6fs,isle99,11/26/2021,1,141.0,That one got moved iirc.
hm7r2h2,The_ChosenOne,11/26/2021,1,1267.0,I know I’m late to the party but I think Fizz and Gnar are the eldest Yordles. Fizz was a Yordle from a time when the oceans made up most of the world and Gnar is a Yordle from like an ice age or dinosaur type time period.
hm8b3zi,MuffinSundae,11/26/2021,1,8.0,Im enjoying Flowers stream the most. Classic Flowers casting with additional input from a pro player perspective.
hm7ib0p,DankMasterJake,11/26/2021,1,196.0,> C9 roster has a much higher ceiling   Lol what. In what world does C9 have a higher ceiling? Cause it definitely isnt this one.

hm7qlqn,DangerousSeaweed0,11/26/2021,1,1569.0, he said that prior to worlds  he would always leave because his wife was lonely.  so upset already as the precedent of leaving for that reason in upsets eyes. he also said that hes not certain its the same situation again  but as i said....precedents

hm7oqzm,Broken_Reality,11/26/2021,1,,What does he have to apologize for? Upset did nothing wrong. He gave his reason for having to leave and thats where the matter ends. Nothing more needs saying.  Adam is the one who needs to apologise.
hm84n04,swellbaby,11/26/2021,1,291.0,There are variations?
hm8fer4,IndesirableSouls,11/26/2021,1,7.0,I hope so tmrw or before dec
hm7ijra,No_Principle_4593,11/26/2021,1,,France so its not even because we dont have laws protecting the wokers I still remember getting a warning for being 1 hour late at work the day my uncle died when I was flipping burgers at Macdonald during my time being a student even after providing legal documents proving I lost a close relative. Not saying it is how it should be just explaining how the real world works.
hm7fzvx,brdlee,11/26/2021,1,144.0,Honestly if Jensen is as bad as LS says he is he’s legit just the clutchest person on the planet.
hm71oub,WarMan1005,11/26/2021,1,188.0,where will this be streamed? will it be free to watch ? :)
hm8b0ak,zoewarner,11/26/2021,1,166.0,No.  Start another thread and dont try to hijack this one.

hm75jxw,Vantablack9,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,I can think a lot of reasons. Miscarriage abort suicide attempts STDs etc. Of course not saying that it has to be something like that but it could be.   In those cases can you imagine something like that being public? In those cases isnt just some guys hating on them on Twitter/Reddit it could lead to family problems or anything
hm8l4sm,Ace_OPB,11/26/2021,1,24.0,Gumayusi was monstrous when he was on ck. Dude absolutely hard carried t1 to their championship. Anybody could see he was on a different level. Envy while not on the same level still is amazing and honestly is much better than berserker atm.
hm85rxa,no_please_no_not_now,11/26/2021,1,15.0,I must ask you do you work at Riot? How can you have so much knowledge about the game and the mechanics? You are basically the  pannenkoek2012 of League
hm750uk,Suspicious-Bus6351,11/26/2021,1,73.0,Hes the new head coach of GENG.
hm8bwav,Toplaners,11/26/2021,1,165.0,Its so true sometimes. I know what my problem is and I know how I could fix it but I just dont.  Ive been duoing with a friend lately and its really made me aware of it.   Ill see the enemy jgl on the map walking toward me and my friend will say on voice coms hes coming top.  Ill go I know I can out play it because the enemy laner is half hp and Im 3/4 hp.  Fast forward 10 seconds and I go 1 for 1 instead of killing both and go I woulda got them both if I just landed X!  I guess in theory if I keep doing this eventually Ill keep improving until I can make the play even though playing safer would make me climb faster.
hm72p68,LAndLight2,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,He wasnt asking. They asked about his opinion and Adam and that was that
hm7wvzw,FOXShaS,11/26/2021,1,204.0,That would be Mel  she has Solari item as her outffit. Pretty obvious in the flashback scene where she was young. And also it was shiny when jinx ult abt to hit.
hm7zilf,SilverPrincev,11/26/2021,1,12337.0,Yeah there were plenty of writing mistakes this act. I got downvoted pretty hard but I just saw TBskyen just released a video that shares our opinion. People will start magically agreeing that writing was pretty subpar
hm83o29,Moonmight_,11/26/2021,1,126.0,I do want Lillia mainly so I can enjoy her on anything outside of League itself
hm75nkh,CoCratzY,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,r/Fnatic or r/leagueoflegends you still post more on French people than on FNC. Rent free in your mind
hm7ehiw,russlinjimis,11/26/2021,1,22.0,Lux supp is busted af rn. No skill champ that just needs to land 1 q for a kill lmao. doesnt need to cs fucking Riot
hm7izk7,Craftingistheway,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Yeah you like a bit more but you aka the other players are not entilted to AT ALL. Not even the tninest bit giga hard and 1000% NOPE. You are not owned jack shit for an explanation further that the org approved of Upsets reasoning and resulting action to leave. They have the information to judge it.  THis is literally just 2 immature kids being butthurt that someone didnt deem them trustworthy and oh what a surprise he was right to do so.
hm7m55q,RemoteAnalysis3809,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,But would you still be fine with it if somehow your traumatic experience that you told your coworker in detail about made it to the front page of this subreddit ready to be dissected memed and joked about by 16yo league players?
hm72qpm,Karukos,11/26/2021,1,133.0,The piano is tuned so the 8th of each note is in tune and I think every 5th is in tune and the discrepancy is then evenly spread out on the rest so nothing is really off of.   But the thing is that perfectly harmonized is a really tricky topic to begin with and its true in some ways and wrong in others but that is like... a big discussion
hm88w3o,BlueVestGuyisafraud,11/26/2021,1,15.0,The house is galio the warhead is centuries worth of extremely powerful magic.  Sylas needs to absorb the magic before he can use it. But thats easier said than done when you need proximity to a football field sized fist going onto you at 90 mph
hm7honq,Usual_Research,11/26/2021,1,43.0,Lol was both bigger than DotA 2 and HoN by 2015.
hm7twsk,xkap,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Respect works both way you know? How do you expect them to respect Upset when he without adequate explanation single handedly destroyed everything they worked entire year for? And on top of that Upset tried to replace his teammates behind their backs because they lack ambitions lol.
hm6yd3y,ghostytemppc,11/26/2021,1,10.0,Exactly. People are bitching that its unfair but it helps to combat snowballing cause your team has a weak link. And a lot of the time the people bitching are people who lost a game cause the enemy team got the gold and it became a skill diff instead of 5 levels over 2 items up
hm8kwtf,UnhealthyDeath,11/26/2021,1,4.0,Season 5 updated map and the base gates exist which were added in 5.1
hm7469a,whydoyoureadnames,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,Yeah not how it works. If my wife got cancer I wouldn’t tell me coworkers I’d explain to my boss I have a family medical emergency and then my boss would handle it. I don’t think you understand that privacy on these matters is deserved and you aren’t obligated to share anything that deep with coworkers.
hm7c002,Sushi2k,11/26/2021,1,125.0,Damn take that TL flair off. Slandering Xmithie like that smh.
hm7oj3z,eddeadcosta,11/26/2021,1,22.0,It is a bug but dragging the champ to top of scoreboard fixes it

hm8njbh,Calipup,11/26/2021,1,4.0,Awesome. Was always interested in the Zac chromas never thought to look them up during this.
hm7jvpo,PinkPurpleBlueBoy,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,TIL that being mature and a decent human being to others is “Mother Teresa.” We truly are fucked as a society huh?
hm70vhg,severin29,11/26/2021,1,141.0,Isnt it in Utrecht?
hm8b4yo,LeagueReddit00,11/26/2021,1,180.0,It certainly isnt that bad in the context of gaining an advantage in video games. There are of course times when ddos is something that causes actual harm but a hit to a virtual rank in a game does not register even a tiny bit as something that would get you prison time.
hm83d7f,ShavedDragon,11/26/2021,1,23.0,Theres this guy named Vander in the first few episodes and I think he may be twitch. I missed a little bit of the end of episode 3 but he seems to be hiding for the rest of the show. Reminds me of what twitch would do
hm8onxp,JankeeUwU,11/26/2021,1,188.0,this has been eye-opening ty so much for posting this!
hm7ai63,hutre,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,From what Nisqy/Bwipo/Adams POV it doesnt seem like they got that though. No sorry but I am dealing with severe and serious family emergency. He just left without saying anything.
hm771ro,GodMadeMeByMistake,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Youre obviously a mentally underdeveloped child.
hm8rgpm,GutsWay,11/26/2021,1,165.0,Can you elaborate on what you think the main difference is between a masters adc and a low diamond adc (csing positioning macro?). Thanks :) and also congratulations super impressive accomplishment.
hm7qwun,arcunii,11/26/2021,1,225.0,So obviously theres many splash arts but in all of them the birds have 6.
hm7p93f,BigB_porter,11/26/2021,1,5.0,Alright that makes sense thank you for the response
hm74zed,Idothisformoney,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,Fanatic has never been a team thats like a second family. They have always just been coworkers. Some might be better friends. But most of them are just coworkers. They are not like the mad lions and G2 where they live together eat together and do everything together.
hm7mjs8,RevolutionaryBricks,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Bruh they went after LS’s grandma I’d say that’s significantly more effort than SO
hm7m5ti,BurningApe,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,He could have at least given some category of what kind of issue it was Family situation is extremely general. Ill say this again its totally fine to leave for an emergency family situation. However there are only very specific situations where you must leave for an emergency situation and not be able to tell anyone (he didnt even tell all his teammates) we dont matter were the public but it has to be something so specific that he was not even willing to give any information to teammate who was impacted by it:  1. Its an extremely controversial family situation that he wants to hide  2. It was not actually a controversial situation but wasnt something worth ditching the team last minute for - something embarrassing etc. and so he has to hide it in order to save his reputation  1 is far more likely given that based on all the info we know it was serious.  In either case its great for reddits daily dose of drama gossip.

hm8esi5,CuteLittleGirI,11/26/2021,1,169.0,He doesnt know how to improve. I had the same problem stuck in silver for years. How can you improve on something you dont know about? Like ask him if his favorite champion beats x champ in lane... if he has to think about it then thats the problem he should know that becuase he probably played the matchup over 100 times. He doesnt know he should know that (obviously anyone gonna say I should know that... but why didnt they)
hm7nqvu,Karpeeezy,11/26/2021,1,89.0,Imagine thinking the USD isnt the worlds reserve currency lmao
hm7u6b7,DieserMastro,11/26/2021,1,551.0,She made the whole game fall asleep
hm72buk,PeanutPotPlant,11/26/2021,1,1616.0,Is there an approximate date for the announcement of the new adc?
hm80ldq,Lethioon,11/26/2021,1,150.0,Hit the Nexus if its a Ranked Game.
hm7s3ie,NeoDestinyy,11/26/2021,1,124.0,Was this the 5.5 fucking k guy?
hm7487y,Craftingistheway,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,Most french people are just as trash as you would imagine. Sad but some steoretypes are not without reason.
hm6yt9p,MoriartyParadise,11/26/2021,1,518.0,The Yasuo players in your team are minions that gained sentience
hm8avez,EmilianoR24,11/26/2021,1,7.0,I still think we have better items now at least they feel impactful. before it was just the same but you have more stats now you have way more interesting options.  90% of the time you where building your same 2 core items every game just like you do now so dont pretend the mythics actually changed anything
hm85tia,-Daksh-,11/26/2021,1,107.0,Good for you man  congratulations
hm7chox,joker_mafia,11/26/2021,1,157.0,i love those Ls sequels xD
hm7fufz,Esmi_Esmenet,11/26/2021,1,147.0,I didnt look into this but it sounds...unlikely because they (Riot) did say they are keeping full control of Arcane. Not sure if Netflix was giving them money to give to a 3rd party animator (that Riot worked with for 8+ years on game cinematics only) for 6 years...and then Netflix basically has nothing. Riot can probably just bugger off and not even deal with NF for season probably + NF doesnt get to change a single frame during the making of...next parts (like it was for this one).
hm71luw,misteryon22,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Youd think the emergency part of family emergency would show that its serious but no we need to spill the tea i guess
hm7eq90,--------V--------,11/26/2021,1,56.0,It absolutely is scummy they are teammates 5 of them depending on one another to win worlds. And you vanish and abandoned them without telling them at the most important point in their career
hm8np4f,Wrsow,11/26/2021,1,9.0,You right. But what with this what i typed above. Lets assume that someone does not like someone very much and I want to ban his account then he sent him a lot of gifts in this way and.. BAN. What in that case?
hm85c4i,iamraskia,11/26/2021,1,159.0,I think if you want to attack you should input the attack… lol
hm7f3q4,Forged_by_Flame,11/26/2021,1,,Even if they are homophobic they will get banned if they show it.  I play on EUNE Ive rarely met homophobic slurs on the server unless someone is doing homoerotic roleplaying in the chat. And if you are doing that in LoL all chat then you are certainly not any more normal than they are.
hm7xme5,Sirouz,11/26/2021,1,277.0,I was there and have wanted it back ever since the split.
hm7m539,ShinaMashir0,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,funny
hm7yrdj,ViraLCyclopezz,11/26/2021,1,27.0,Hopefully new void jungler has at least some dinosaur resemblance
hm7bgqt,RiotRayYonggi,11/26/2021,1,65.0,Koyuncu hero
hm7neka,nighthawk475,11/26/2021,1,,Definitely a good reason :)  I tend to keep quickcast on for every champion and use those shift+ability keys more often on characters Im still learning until I get the hang of them. Certain characters like blitzcrank I tend to use the shift+ability normal cast more than half the time even now when I main him. Its just really helpful but when Im doing that Im taking my time to line up the shot anyway and I dont mind the fact that theres an extra keypress. When Im combing someone with e>q>r (or q>r>e) I can do it without the normal cast and get it out faster instead then making it easier to do without leaving time for them to flash away.
hm758uf,Kentori,11/26/2021,1,73.0,Yeah he’s going to be the head coach of GEN G
hm7xhna,No_Virtue,11/26/2021,1,,closing gold gap makes bounties disappear and champ bounties also dont have a time limit so 2 ways they work differently.
hm7izn1,nitko87,11/26/2021,1,114.0,Riven taught me animation cancelling playing losing matchups slowly and how to snowball when possible
hm79c4g,Hexporpora,11/26/2021,1,4.0,thank you <3
hm78ibe,YoungHeartOldSoul,11/26/2021,1,105.0,You know I thought it did but it only happened in one game and I couldn’t tell you why
hm8ek0v,tanezuki,11/26/2021,1,11.0,The thing is if any skirmisher attempts to use shieldbow theyll be given the entire items value the lifesteal isnt locked to be available to ADCs only.   Like imagine if shieldbows lifesteal would be dependant on being a ranged champion. Thats the similarity here.
hm8kky7,ChonkyMonkey91,11/26/2021,1,6.0,Thank you so much for pointing these out and for making a detailed list AND video displaying these bugs. Great job hopefully Riot sees this and fixes the changes accordingly!  Ive definitely noticed 145 and maybe even 6 (W cd feels longer at least).
hm7vj5o,Pretty_Airline_5063,11/26/2021,1,17.0,Tyler2
hm7ne58,HuaRong,11/26/2021,1,,This is a talon thread. Dont hop on a Riots comment just because theyre here for one thing.

hm6y6uk,iLLuSi0NN,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,IDIOTA He didnt play on 1st game day
hm8ihkq,Fluid_Highlight2035,11/26/2021,1,,Some of the scenes were so drawn out I had to skip forward. Like how many goddamn romantic scenes do we need of Jayce and that girl. I’m all for a thicker story but they needed to trim some of the fat out especially since we get to see it one year at a time…most of this stuff we already know as well. The last thing I want to watch again is Vi and Cait fucking talking about absolutely nothing for three episodes while we just get told over and over the arcane stuff is “dangerous” like no shit.
hm8d6iw,Kripox,11/26/2021,1,29.0,Ye and I cant remember Vi ever being all that dominant lvl 4 so this isnt new. Its possible she has gotten slightly weaker at that point still this season I wouldnt really know but I really felt the need to point out that overall Vi is really good.
hm7xezc,Axendil,11/26/2021,1,1.0,I guess you can always look at the patch notes which Im fairly sure are accessible but I literally never look at them myself so maybe it would be a good idea to make it more obvious
hm7ta53,Ahrlin4,11/26/2021,1,61.0,>Why do people like you refuse to listen to pings about bad items? When other people just want to help you learn the game.  Yeah but lets be honest spam pinging an item isnt about helping anyone learn.  If the person doesnt know why Maw is a bad pick pings wont help. They wont know if its a bad item for their specific champ against their specific opponents in their current game state or just in general. Its just flaming someone and expecting them to read your mind as to why.  Also while Maw is indisputably trash people are terrible at accepting even the more viable non-meta items. Ive been spam-pinged for building Randuins on Urgot when there was a hyper-fed Yasuo on the enemy team. Getting pinged is just as likely the other guy being stupid as you making a mistake.

Or youre passing on the info but in French when from the VC everyone else is using English.   Basically so long as youre playing and communicating properly most people wont care if youre talking with your friend in French.

hm7i2vj,Gaarando,11/26/2021,1,144.0,Ok and now rewatch EG vs C9 and see how poorly Danny did. Also 100T improved while TL got worse and thats why 100T won the split.
hm72n5x,nozozo_y,11/26/2021,1,76.0,Yeah maw is fine. Its main value is hexdrinker being a strong component but the full item isn’t even bad. Only problem with it is lifeline passive not stacking.
hm7anbl,Melodias07,11/26/2021,1,84.0,To add to that in DRX worlds run it was more of pyosik 0830 show.

hm8bcpx,-SNST-,11/26/2021,1,17.0,WW Q kinda somehow casts even after dying if you hold Q while dying right? Since rework
hm7z89p,Poluact,11/26/2021,1,277.0,I think it would be less. English vocabulary has more words in general. I tried an online tool and it found 22k 7-letter words. I skimmed through it and it also includes multiple grammar forms. I dont know how large is vocabulary this site uses though.  But ok lets err on the side of caution and say its 100k words. Now calculating the probability is tricky because words and letters are not all equal some are used more often some less there are other rules like amount of contiguous consonants and vowels you can typically have in a word etc-etc. But lets say theyre all equal for simplicity. Russian have 33 letters but one of them is usually just ignored and replaced with other similar letters.  So we have 100k 7-letter words consisting from a combination of 32 letters. We put 7 letters in random order how do we calculate probability we hit one of them?  ----------  Edit: ok the amount of completely random 7-letter words we can do with an alphabet of 32 letters is 32^7 = 34359738368 right? So the probability would be 100000/34359738368 ≈ 0.0000029 or 0.00029%. Is that correct with all the assumptions made?
hm71p4x,frenkli_h,11/26/2021,1,49.0,ik i just forget sometimes i still won the game and carried tho all good idk why people in these comments are these mad and try to judge  every single right click i had
hm71atm,piotrj3,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,That is exactly why i question it because i doubt it or maybe I dont know something other people do.
hm7tvcg,TheDiabeticGM,11/26/2021,1,68.0,Now thats a huge part of it. I dont think that Silco didnt genuinely care for Jinx. The issue is that Silco is a bad man and even when he is trying to care for somebody he will still twist and manipulate them to do what he wants because he knows whats best. And thats how abusers work. And thats why its such good writing. Because they show all of that all fifty billion different shades of this very complicated and nuanced relationship. The more I think about it the more I am happy to overlook the couple of sloppier and tropier things going on with the show and hop aboard the Its A Mastahpiece! bandwagon lol. It is NUTS how much they can fit into a mere nine episodes.
hm8qsj5,Bobandjim12602,11/26/2021,1,48.0,Yeah they ruined Jinx for you. Personally I prefer the Arcane version. Shes definitely not the PG I love blowing up shit for the Lulz shes far more terrifying and sad in this rendition. An actual psychopath. Personally I think the show will transform her from her current chaotic evil self to her far less depressing chaotic neutral self featured in the game. She just needs to go through the character arc that gets her there. Arcane is all around far darker than the game itself. So its possible that shell never become the PG Jinx from the game but well have to wait and see.
hm7bhdj,TH3RM4L33,11/26/2021,1,65.0,Nope its still there. Rare though.

hm7s076,IWouldLikeAName,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Yes. I do in fact mean the trolls how could you tell? Who says it doesnt make a difference. It can still heavily impact a person. Performance can be controlled and is usually on you. Something like a personal emergency is out of your control and can make you feel helpless. Having random trolls making fun of your parents death and that your brother that you loved and looked up to was the cause will still sting especially when DL was finally starting to make amends with his parents.   Why even have a chance at being harassed by trolls when you can just keep the matter to your inner circle.
hm8nypc,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,165.0,rakan will always be a champion that engages in mid ~ late game. He can sometimes just go for the enemy flank and 1 man ult him vs trying to get a big ult on their 4. In lane he can play as an enchanter poke engage or sustain. I had the most success when I had a lot of divers on my team. The beauty about rakan is that hes so versatile in lane and can impact the map at the same time.

hm7bqxc,jaguar317,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,You do realize that if Upset were to tell Adam the full details he would be sharing someone elses private struggle with Adam has absolutely nothing to do with that person right?   I do feel bad for Upsets teammates and I understand their frustration. But I think two things are very clear. First publicly bashing and sending massive waves of hate towards Upset is 100% the wrong move. Second there is no way Upset is obligated to share someone elses situation with Adam who he isnt very close to and who certainly isnt at all connected with the person who is close to Upset.
hm74zs4,libvn,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,Youre either very young or not very creative. There are a ton of things such as sexual assault where its not up to you to if you want to share it with your team mates.

hm7mjf6,Zuldak,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Most people are ok releasing general information eg death in the family serious sickness etc.   Leaving worlds 12 hours before it starts really whittles down to only a handful of circumstances that could justify his leaving.   Frankly it looks like he has some lame excuse like Adam says and upset is trying to hide because he knows how pathetic he will look
hm70c89,xxxtrafalgarxxx,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,She’s … what ? If thats the case then the reaction from the community isnt unreal lmao
hm6zmw5,SaulJoker,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Reddit can’t take no for an answer.  I can only imagine what Upset and his family is going through especially his wife. I truly hope they’re doing alright.  Also fuck Adam for his unprofessionalism. Yeah I understand he must he frustrated with the situation but “I’m not trying to start drama” after writing 3 paragraphs which do exactly that is not the way to approach this.  Seriously man how could you possibly ever think that Upset leaving right before the most important tournament of the year is due to a petty reason?  Do you seriously think Upset wanted the team to crash and burn? Or Fnatic management? Bwipo has expressed his frustration but he certainly didn’t seem to think Upset was lying. Neither did Nisqy or Hyli. So why should you?  Praising himself pointing fingers at Upset and badmouthing both the org and his former teammates.  Pathetic.
hm79gew,Melodias07,11/26/2021,1,84.0,TBH canna > Zeus now we didnt saw much from Zeus and he didnt look that great.  Might change if he get enough stage experience with the team.
hm7oy4h,Roberto410,11/26/2021,1,156.0,Yeah Id definitely prefer to see them recording in the studio and not lip syncing.  Its be cool to see the effects chain in each of their voices as well.
hm7jnih,TrixieH,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,His post in French was already a mess grammatically speaking so Id not be surprised if the english translation is messed up too - didnt read it. Anyway Adams post was a big dick move.

hm7mlyj,c9haiondrugs,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Serious question. Do you not see the parallels between this and being sick?  lets not pretend when someone says im not feeling good before an important day  theyre not looked at in the exact same light.   If a kid says hes feeling good and fakes a cough are we going to burn the parents at the stake for not buying it knowing theres a 50% chance they just dont wanna go to school?   So yes we can respect not feeling good or family emergency but it does raise some eyebrows and if you want to keep it private you need to do it in a way that comes off sincere to the people who put their trust in you.
hm75etc,Zerwurster,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,For real. Upset worked closely with them for months and decided he couldnt trust most of them.  Somehow that means Upset is in the wrong because 3>1.  Isnt it more likely in their time together Upset made a couple of experiences with his teammates that justify his behavior?  Like some young and heated guys without any real filter like Adam and Bwipo simply being not trustworthy to such a great extend?  3 teammates are mad at him and only 1 is on his side that means they are right! Or maybe 3 teammates had their tiltlevel exceed their capability for empathy and now we are where we are.  FNC wouldnt keep Upset if they had reason to believe he was unreasonable in his decisions and is likely to repeat what happend at worlds.

hm7m6yc,Spitfire836,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,My personal views on them are irrelevant. Even if I don’t think Doublelift is a celebrity he still is. Millions of people still watch and follow League esports and when millions of people follow you then you lose privacy. It’s just something that happens. Same reason why “normal” celebrities have no privacy either.

Hey guys uhhh so I need leave at the most critical moment....yeah yeah I know our first match is 12 hours away......I told you family issues......what issues? you dont need to know just trust me.

They chose which champs to be part of the skinline and then forced a random flimsy story that connected them together without any regard for established canon.  They saw that the dating sim style with the Spirit Blossom events was successful so they thought people would like a self-insert rookie character. However that works for the former not the latter. Especially when paired with cringe dialogue.

hm7qh6y,JamisonDouglas,11/26/2021,1,252.0,Yeah dude this has been common knowledge for a while now. If your account is fresh (as in 0 ranked games played) and you spam normals as a 5 stack while grinding to and try hard you will have stupid LP games/minimal losses and be able to climb like a rocket ship even with a sub 50% win rate. Same for flex. As long as the account hasnt played ranked your non ranked games can alter your MMR. Tarzaned released a guide on it right before he stopped trying at all in soloq and basically said your first 20 normal games drastically alter your MMR and showed the effects.   Just look up normal game MMR exploit and pick a sauce that looks to your taste theres many to choose from. Has been this case for at least a year. Yamatosdeath got found out doing it like this time last year for doing it which is when I think the general populatuon learned about it. God knows how long its actually been the case for/how long people have been using it. They claimed to have fixed it at the start of the season but it still works just slightly less effectively.
hm8amki,NaranPol,11/26/2021,1,16.0,Yeah CLG hate is at full steam these days so I dont think so (Just look at your other reply. I dont even get what its supposed to mean lol). Beating the shit out of a dead horse in hope of some easy attention clearly takes priority over supporting the region.   Regardless of all the braindead takes Ive heard this last year Greg Kims plan has looked super smart so far so Im really happy with our offseason. Hope the org stays communicative through the split and we as fans we can understand the roster we are fielding support it and watch it grow.
hm85zdu,mazrrim,11/26/2021,1,92.0,Every role has harder and easier champions support has few extremely high skill cap ones but that doesnt make the average player much different.   Seraphine is all skillshots apart from a high CD shield obviously more to keep track of than Annie or twisted fate even. But because one is a support role (and frankly because one is a cute aesthetic character) its considered mechanically easy by people who have never played the role.  It only becomes a gap in role skill in extremely few picks like Akali or azir but 99.999% of the people calling support easy cant play those champion at a master+ level either

hm79zzv,Conker184,11/26/2021,1,84.0,Im sure the players care a fair bit about it but you cant seriously compare these results with any domestic league and MSI/Worlds when its a 3 day tournament with a bunch of random Bo1s with different teams strung together parading as an overall Bo5 you cant exactly view a team/player performance based on the region results when they only get to play a few games for instance 2017 all 3 of SKT/SSG/KT finished 2-1 but they were runner ups b/c you only guarantee a single Bo1 in the final per team and they had the crutch that was MVP that year

hm7336l,infamousspammer,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,The thing that is really the saddest part about Adams twitlonger is the fact that he thinks that Fnatic would have performed better at worlds with Upset under these circumstances. I mean if something so bad happened in Upsets private life that he is even considering to leave his team and the chance to play at worlds he would surely not be able to properly focus on the game and perform up to his normal level.  Has there been some issue with the communication inside the team? I dont know but it seems like it. I can understand Upset not wanting to tell his teammates about some issues of people in his private life. I mean imagine his wife was suffering from heavy depressions. Would there be any reason to tell this to his teammates especially if they are just that - teammates? I for sure wouldnt and that would also be the case if it is just me having depressions. I would probably only tell my closest friends. And lets face reality just because you are on a team doesnt mean you are even friends. So there is no reason for the other guys on his team to expect anything more then some standard phrase. And if they are not satisfied with that it would be the job of Fnatics management to ensure them that there is a valid reason for Upset to leave.  That there also was some miscommunication around the thing with Alphari at least based on what the two twitlongers state surely doesnt help in calming Adam. But nonetheless it is a very bad fashion to air your dirty laundry in public...

hm79fy5,TH3RM4L33,11/26/2021,1,55.0,Yep the spell just has to hit. Its kinda the same principle with bug #7. You just have to press the button but the spell doesnt have to cast.
hm8asa0,IWillNameMyChildZoe,11/26/2021,1,2.0,I believe those are meant for champions with high base mana.
hm7hq1i,ApplePitou,11/26/2021,1,2.0,Sounds very cool and epic :3
hm7rd0b,Mejalu,11/26/2021,1,15.0,I dont know either. Its only this community of all the games I play.  I think its because League is such a technical game that requires a lot more calculations than raw mechanical skill like most other games. On top of the fact the game has a lot of downtime where they can watch everyone elses mistakes and theres so much surrounding the game (LCS Coaching vods Youtube channels op.ggs lolalytics) that they think learning the game is like learning an actual skill in real life.   I also think most league players dont have much of a social life since it takes a remarkable amount of time to be good at this game. They get most of their social interaction from the internet stuff like reddit and game chat.   Also I think most league players only play league so they think this behavior is tame or normal when its actually psychotic
hm83y2x,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,92.0,I wont fight the logistics of the skill level of NA compared to other regions since I dont really think its relevant. I might be a big fish in a small pond but I can still help and answer questions for fish smaller than me.
hm7y9lb,karkuri,11/26/2021,1,11.0,i still remember one match about half a year ago when we won against illaoi that was 55/7/21 because i stole baron infernal soul and elder. never give up
hm7g278,Over-Cranberry-1808,11/26/2021,1,36.0,Hey glad you answered!  To be fair you are right I did rewatch the scene (after commenting) and I gotta say it doesn’t bother me that much although I do not like the art style and the music choice I should leave that to personal taste and ofc respect it. (Still think the fireflies rap introduction was not needed)  Not sure how you feel about the music choice in the series in general tho do you only disagree with me about the bridge scene? For example you think jinx shot with sting’s music worked? Or that scene where imagine dragons materialize?  It feels to me that the overall aesthetics of the series does not match highly produced modern pop like they should have went with some industrial sounds punk something gritty and loud? I also work with video and animation although not on this kind of high end production far from it (motion graphics mostly)😔   Thanks for the reply!
hm8k87o,Loki3z,11/26/2021,1,4.0,As they should. Hopefully next time when theyre about to make a big event they should take as much time as they need to give us some good quality shit
hm8ol9e,tanezuki,11/26/2021,1,24.0,Technically not a Juggernaut but a Vanguard.   Unless they changed his class ranking since they mini reworked him ? Would make sense considering how he lost his two supportive abilities.
hm7rfmg,DangerousSeaweed0,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,ure kidding. messing with someones work and livelyhood is probably the least proffesional donezo manifests we ever got in league. its a legitimate reason to be pissed at considering how short esports careers are.  adam was kicked out of 1 of 2 western teams that actually have a chance at doing anything internationally  and he was kicked for a player he clowed on in their series....as a rookie with a lot more potential to grow.  thats a slap on the face for him  even more so when the decision had upsets involvement after he absoultly bailed on them and had the audacity to tell them face to face that he doesnt trust them or that hes not up to his standards.  that situation alone would be enough to break the team  without including the worlds fiasco in it. If u think that was unproffesional from adam  what do u call upsets behaviour ?
hm7hmtw,Jiffyyy,11/26/2021,1,74.0,> but his teammates sure as fuck did  no his teammates wanted to know. they had no right to know into his personal life.  would it make things easier to understand for them? yes.  does that mean he is forced to give any details of his personal life? no.   Hell if you were to call in to work because of a tragic death in the family would you say hey boss my mom got ran over yesterday while crossing the street after getting some groceries I dont think I can make it?  no you simply say there is a serious personal matter you need to tend to.  if you cant respect peoples boundaries and attack them for it Im not sure what else to say.  and he gave them the reason. they simply are not in the need to know of the details.
hm83jzy,waltzingwizard,11/26/2021,1,92.0,what are the biggest solo queue mistakes you see from adcs below masters?
hm8j9gp,doglop,11/26/2021,1,26.0,Lmao dude you dont know how to play the game and yet you shittalk a lot get good please and stop making your support life a nigthmare
hm7ase2,lppur3ps3,11/26/2021,1,4457.0,But its not even about not wanting to divulge too much you shouldnt need to do that in any sense. The statement of a serious urgent family matter is more than enough. Usually that can mean Death extreme harm etc etc. It doesnt take a genius to conclude that. Its common.  He clearly didnt try? Says who. Being angry/Upset at the situation doesnt imply that at all. So people including bwipo in this .... I just dont know unless theres something I missed. So you have Adam and possibly Nisqy. Everyone else is either a ? Or disagrees.  Also companies are just as similar key stakeholder leaves due to that and a project cant go ahead and you lose A LOT and possibly your job? Very similar. But we have a level of decency that if they have to leave for a seriously urgent matter and others who do know have said yeah. (Such as the coach etc) then thats not for me to question let alone making a post flaming him publically and now getting hate toward him and family lmfao.  I dont care if its worlds or something greater urgent family matters come first and you have no right to know unless you are the employer just trying to verify if its true. Simple as.
hm869eh,--------V--------,11/26/2021,1,143.0,But will tell the internet? They aren’t work buddies
hm7zb5k,Emotional-Passage454,11/26/2021,1,103.0,US is fading like a once brightful star. The poverty grade and inequality is very noticeable.
hm7ly59,Fuhreeldoe,11/26/2021,1,47.0,Yeah thats exactly what I told you I was going to do. Because your personage is of someone who cant be argued with in any beneficial way. And again I dont know how many times I have to point out what you already said but if you want to blast me for being judgemental you should understand that conjecture about how someone feels why they feel that way and tell them the type of person they are all qualifies as judgement. I know what you came to do but Ive no intention of engaging with an attitude like that of the one youve presented here. Would venture a guess to say that you were already aware of that.
hm7fn14,Artcxy,11/26/2021,1,100.0,I dont think this is a good assumption. Whether something is a realistic personality archetype and whether or not the personality is attractive isnt necessarily the same thing. Sometimes its enough for the character to be a mesh of different fetishes though most of the time it turns out disastrous. Mels mom is an extremely rare case of this working and I love her. Her character just works in this case and the fact she isnt an archetype doesnt break her so calling her for what she is isnt degrading.
hm8a7oe,Psychic_Joker,11/26/2021,1,8.0,How are the captain flowers/corejj and blaber’s team perspectives? Because Spica’s stream has been absolutely fucking hilarious so I’d highly recommend it
hm74kac,moroheus,11/26/2021,1,42.0,Your insecurities
hm8kyje,Initial_Length6140,11/26/2021,1,26.0,His pick rate was like 2% tho...
hm7srn2,snowflakepatrol99,11/26/2021,1,144.0,If he wanted to improve he wouldve. There isnt a person in the world that can unironically be stuck in bronze if they are trying to improve. You just need average IQ to not be fully blind and to have semi working arm/arms/leg/legs. Theres players with no hands who play with straws and racing pedals in diamond. You cant tell me he is seriously trying and is still in bronze.   He likes the idea of being higher rank but he is never putting in the work required to get there. Raging at teammates and op champs is most likely because he refuses to accept that he is there because of himself and denies the fact that he needs to work on his mistakes in order to climb. Bad mentality is about the worst thing you can have when you want to improve.  Another red flag is playing 1000+ games and not improving. This only happens if you autopilot and dont think about anything in the game. You are just doing. If you win you win. Just taking random engagements here and there and relying only on muscle memory to carry you. Well when you are bronze not only do you not have any muscle memory to rely on you also arent improving because you arent playing to improve you are playing to play and waste your time.  Ive tried coaching a gold friend of mine because he said he wanted to improve and hit plat but after a few games it was obvious he didnt want that and hed rather argue back pointlessly and pretend that what I pointed out wasnt a mistake that he needed to fix. The biggest things in your improvement journey are mental and not playing in auto pilot. Most players that are stuck are lacking both of those.

hm7doox,Horizon96,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,Because the German Spanish Swedish Norwegian Dutch and so on all learned English and it makes for an easy way for everyone to communicate. I get your point but realistically a person cant learn every European language and English tends to be the common ground for most Europeans.

hm7wj2o,Sciipi,11/26/2021,1,558.0,I remember playing some weird IOS game where one gun changed its properties based on the performance of the stock market the previous day. It was one of the weirdest things Ive seen in a game.
hm8e4u5,hpl2000,11/26/2021,1,,Except the average person isn’t a preschooler lol. Are you better than the average person that took maths all the way through highschool? That’s a fair baseline to see if you’re better than the average.

hm7lar5,drkdragon1017,11/26/2021,1,2.0,Expect them to happen every game and trade the best you can. And if the trade is *always* getting no kills in return I can’t help but think champions aren’t being piloted correctly (assuming it’s a towerdive)
hm8bza5,1000baby,11/26/2021,1,4.0,I think this is a brilliant change for both teams.   Zoom has always been more of a tank type of player with good map awareness and lane management. I think it fits perfectly well with the more aggressive mid/bot focus of TES. While JDG lacks hard carries. 369 definitely plays more similarly to how TheShy plays for IG.
hm7qla9,HNIC1995,11/26/2021,1,110.0,I like both for different reasons.  It is really fun to follow a BB season through the live feeds.  I think overall Survivor is the better show and I wish they could rework BB in some way to bring back some of that old magic.  Ill keep watching though because I can pretend is better than other reality tv.
hm8m4v8,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,140.0,It depends on the ranks. I will just speak for under masters. The diffs are kind of half true. Example youre playing jayce top and are forced to leash + weaksided. Of course youre not going to be able to play the game so in that sense it is jungle diff but at the same time you can do things to minimize your deficit when put into certain scenarios.

Its my fucking speculation holy shit I even said we probably wont ever know what happened and providing deaths in the family is ruled out. Thats the most logical thing. I even said it could be Upset who cheated.  Whats wrong bud did you get cheated on or some shit? Did me bringing up that scenario trigger the ever living fuck out of you?  >So that is 80€ for the first session and 50€ for every additional.  I dont use obsolete currencies sorry.
hm76dws,SP3EDI,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,what has upset to do with nisqy not having a team ? Nisqy wanted out and go to c9. C9 bailed fnatic wanted a new mid and no one wants nisqy. so he played his cards wrong and is  ha no team because of his own misjudgement. Why is that upsets fault ?
hm7i0sv,--------V--------,11/26/2021,1,74.0,Clearly you have never been a part of a legitimate team and it shows.  No I would call in and say I had a death in the family.

hm8tp7r,SpiralVortex,11/26/2021,1,20.0,Theres a lot of weird vision bugs going on ATM even for champs that dont have stealth in their kit at all.  Luxs E reveals her location (including FoW and brushes) but only if her E is actively on them. Like...how/why?  Seen multiple people mention bugs on Eve/Rengar/Pyke especially starting with pre-season. Hopefully a Rioter sees this vid and they can assign people to try fix these things. Its frustrating locating bugs writing up detailed reports on things you can replicate 100% of the time and months later the bugs persist because you werent lucky enough to get a Rioter on your reddit post that day.

Anyone who thinks those guys dont deserve an explanation doesnt deserve a shred of empathy from anyone.

hm759c5,whydoyoureadnames,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,That’s on fnatic management then not upset. Again not hard to get. They don’t deserve to know more. Simple.  These people aren’t owed details into his private life his wife had a family emergency that’s all that needs to be said. Them feeling they deserve more info is a them problem and management failing to communicate not upset.   And that doesn’t excuse Adam aiming his fans to harass upset.

hm7bvkg,pinkspott,11/26/2021,1,7.0,Thank you so much for the quick reply! Thought it might end up being this way.       Its almost intuitive at this point: the reason for ability behavior is the reason for lots of inconsistencies just the usual this is what happens except for these edge cases but theyre not gamebreaking so its not going to be standardized any time soon sort of thing. Basically it is how it is and it is what it is.    Still doesnt hurt to check with the resident *Sion-aea muscipula*. Thanks again.

hm8s918,Pure_Void,11/26/2021,1,18.0,a good center for both is conqueror so if u dont know which one ur gonna want to go even if u see there comp just go conqueror but most of the time its champ select that u think of it since with most jg ur supposed to have a game plan based on ur team and enemy team comp but id recommend just devoting to one before u get in the game and try to plan out where ur gonna start who ur gonna gank for from etc before the game

hm8u1x9,SoDamnToxic,11/26/2021,1,182.0,Basically easy to play is not the same as easy to climb.  People confuse the two because they are dumb.  You can do well on support easily but to climb is not always up to you.

hm7ezi1,ChaliElle,11/26/2021,1,184.0,The size of servers are the reason for separation. EUW is 2nd biggest singular server after KR (China have MUCH more players but they are spread out across 29 servers) and isnt really well known for stability. Merging it with EUNE would further increase the population by 50-60%. At that point you would have population equal to about 7 CN servers. It would be just asking for server issues.
hm8elrp,barub,11/26/2021,1,118.0,Now im interested in knowing how can I help my jg without being a nuisance or falling too behind. I wanna try it in my games
hm84f83,Dvscape,11/26/2021,1,159.0,But arent Diamond players roughly 1-2% of the ranked population? If you factor in players who dont even touch ranked this percentage becomes even smaller. If Diamond rank is your threshold for players who truly want to improve & win then 20% is way too generous of a share.
hm7lvt3,Jeremy64vg,11/26/2021,1,148.0,basically knight was offered more money then the LPL pay cap. So basically there is a limit as to what LPL can offer players and if the contract is above that it can be shut down

hm7x938,ILoveWesternBlot,11/26/2021,1,,support in lower elos is not as easy to climb with because you cant consistently rely on your teammates to carry with the advantages you spoonfeed them. Having done my time in low elo playing support I can tell you that spoonfeeding 4 kills and a turret to your vayne wont stop them from tumbling forward in every fight and getting blown up instantly.   Once you climb higher it gets a lot better though
hm8sl15,Pure_Void,11/26/2021,1,104.0,ofc there gonna look terrible when they have an academy top laner and i legit watch all the games the shy yea he does get kinda camped but he also doesnt respect any jg and never backs off like compared to all the top tier lpl tops the shy is near the bottom maybe he changes next season but thats all its been looking like and with lwx his in a top 3 team no one is saying his the worst but compared to the teams his competing against  his bad

hm7iio7,scapefiend,11/26/2021,1,,  Whatever it was Upset presence wouldnt help the existing situation. Its selfish to have him sacrifice his future just for emotional support. I would be hard itd require some emotional maturity and selfishness. But that would be the right thing to do.

hm7jx1m,LakersLAQ,11/26/2021,1,63.0,Sign a one year contract and one bad split/year means you are making much less next year. It goes both ways.
hm7dsqa,-LostInCloud-,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,The point is that Upset is to decide who he wants to share these things with. He did share with Yamato he would have shared with Hylli.  I guess he was right not to share with Adam and Bwipo
hm7r9zr,ConscienceNot,11/26/2021,1,15.0,I tried to beat him as panthen with full mythic item and he literally had just tabis. I couldnt beat him even when he started at 50% of HP.
hm7mdlg,Miyaor,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,He didnt tell them enough.  Its one thing to tell them like how I did in the first bit you need to give some information and 3 member of FNC didnt get enough. Adam and Nisqy (based on Nisqy liking Adams tweet) and Bwipo (based on him literally saying he didnt know) didnt know enough. All three didnt think it was serious enough to warrant him leaving based on what they knew.   He needed to convey how serious it was. He didnt. The way you say things matters and if three members all feel similarly about it it wasnt just one person misunderstanding. It was one person not giving them the bare minimum of information.  Even if you think Adam is a shit person you think Nisqy as well? Bwipo too? Nah he didnt convey the message properly and betrayed his teammates due to that.   I am not pissed I just feel strongly about this. I quite literally do not care if Upsets father was the ringleader behind 9/11. I just feel strongly about the situation because I have been in two similar situations one where the teammate apologized properly. The sense of betrayal you feel from a teammate ditching you is very very high and not something I would wish for anyone to feel. The time my teammate properly conveyed his feelings sucked but we are still close and all of us on the team never held it against him.  The thing Adam gets from knowing more is Closure. Closure is important for EVERYONE not just Upset. Upset wasnt the only one who was impacted by this but he only thought about himself and his friend on the team.

hm71uu9,Agreeable_Junket_271,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,I challenge anyone to think of a possible understandable reason for Upsets departure (I am hoping to be proven wrong) that satisfies:  1) Required Upset to immediately relocate in the middle of a career defining moment  2) Is so privacy-sensitive that the best explanation you can give to your teammates is that its a family emergency without being able  a single additional piece of context even a month after.  2.5) Not a medical emergency.

hm83uhj,Mazsi1201,11/26/2021,1,3.0,If you want to gain XP youll need to queue for COOP vs AI this will match you with supposedly 4 other real players on your team against 5 enemy bots. In reality a lot of the people playing this gamemode are just bots that are used to level accounts (to be sold later) so a lot of the times it will just be like 3 bots on your team against 5 bots on the enemy team. You can also just create a custom game where you can add as many bots to either team as you like (up to a maximum of 5 total players ofcourse) so you can play with 4 bots on your team against 5 enemy bots (but you can do fun challanges as well like 1 v 5ing bots and such. These become trivial after a certain point but if you just started they might be interesting). But keep in mind that you dont get any XP for custom games (which you need to level your account up to recieve resources to get new champions as well as new summoner spells and gamemodes)

hm71jv3,HeckAryan,11/26/2021,1,141.0,What if somebody did ask huh what then? Im sure they were quite satisfied with the answer. But you no you cannot for the life of you find a way to somehow think about what someone else thinks or feels. When you imply that nobody asked youre talking solely about yourself. The world doesnt revolve around you. Try to find the simple joys of life instead of wasting perhaps the best years of your life away sitting in your shit smeared cheeto dust covered cum bespeckled ergonomic office chair. Maybe start working out think about somebody other than you secure yourself a date anything will work so long as you get the fuck outside and stop asking who asked every 2 fucking minutes because quite frankly nobody asked for your opinion as well. Youre but a speck of extra stinky shit in a pile of manure thats all the significance you have in this world but you can change that with 4 simple words: Shutting the fuck up. Thank you and have a good day

Nerf to all the bruisers benefit him since now the only thing that can keep him in check is Camille and even she needs help to duel nasus post 6. Also people that say that nasus is useless lategame are half right and half wrong sure he cant reach anyone on teamfights but if his team is decent the pressure he makes by just running at the adc with ghost and requiring at least 3 people to kill him fast is really valuable (if his team can utilize it).

Upset just needs to tell them there is a personal problem and he needs to leave to deal with it. they dont need to know the details because all they would do with them is judge him and determine if they personally feel that he should care for his personal life which is pointless because they have a biased view being the players on the team wanting to play so they would want him to stay.

hm8epjr,Odd_Play_5769,11/26/2021,1,6.0,While the initial learning curve is unbelievably steep once you learn the game you can play forever and its very very fun win or lose if you know what youre doing.  Most other sports are the opposite: extremely easy to learn and understand but you cant really play at the dame level forever since your character (your body) eventually breaks down.   There are assumptions that League players will decline even FASTER somehow than physical athletes where I think the opposite is true. If were to define mechanics as mechanical skill displayed through sharp/quick inputs (which is trackable) relative to opponents inputs (basically fancy way of saying reaction time) then  DOPA displays relatively average mechanics especially for his rank. But notice he hits rank one basically every season at some point except this season. Even then he was high 1k+ Challenger on Chinese Super Server and KR server the two servers with the reputation as being the most skilled difficult to climb in and competitive.   The jury is really still out on aging e sports since the whole industry is still in its infancy. But it seems most names I remember from Season 1 are still playing and at a very high level at that. They may not be pros but they are still challenger+ on servers which isnt a joke thats very impressive idc what server.

KT 2017 was a super team you take arguably the best player in each role and bring them together GenG has only two players you could argue are best in their role (Ruler&Chovy) and even then I think its not the strongest argument when you have Showmaker and Gumayusi or even Teddy or Deokdam. This is a good roster but this is not what a super team is by definition.

[https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/main-stats](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/main-stats)  What I am hearing is that shaco and Katarina should have 55% winrates. I respectfully disagree.  Anyway swain is not as hard as you make him out to be. I played swain during the middle of this season and he is by far the easiest botlaner I have played. He may have significantly less carry potential than most marksmen but he really isnt that hard to win with. The main skill in playing swain is landing your E and that isnt even required on botlane swain because your support can just CC them for you. Because of his ease of access he is probably balanced around a 52% winrate but he should never have been able to hit 55% for half a season without being hotfixed.

hm73v61,BHowe1205,11/26/2021,1,42.0,are you saying that short of death theres *literally not a single thing* you can think of that could have happened to Upsets family to justify him going home? im not speculating on what happened but if someone in his family had been assaulted or was suffering mental health issues (among many other similar bad things) then i fully understand his decision  &#x200B  also its really shitty to judge a woman based on her past relationships that you know nothing about or for the fact that she did sex work and then to use that judgement to influence whether or not his reasoning was good enough. legit just the type of harassment and speculation that Upset asked people not to do
hm81lj4,learclow,11/26/2021,1,18.0,Thank you!! 🥰
hm81j8w,Kripperino_Pasterino,11/26/2021,1,110.0,Usually Faker sacks his lane to get his team ahead so to me it is not clear how he compares in a true 1v1 setting. Tbf though faker has had better players to lift up than chovy so idk. It will be a very interesting LCK split and I hope we have some bangers even though I have this gruesome feeling that T1 is just gonna roll over everyone again.
hm8cm87,kevinroman63,11/26/2021,1,16.0,Thats crap plenty of people care about NA talent. I for one am excited about this team.
hm74w7m,UniqueError,11/26/2021,1,141.0,Ive just found both pretty much equally toxic its just that people speak different languages. On EUNE its usually Polish Slovene and Slovak and on EUW its French German and Spanish.
hm8nxdv,GWFOSER,11/26/2021,1,9.0,Link to where it says the new champs aren’t from arcane? That just seems like such a bad idea from riot to not make them from the show that is just doing insane rn
hm79zsv,Seneido,11/26/2021,1,189.0,but the same is true for europe and china? look at ibai and tell me you cant be famous internationally as a european streamer. the difference is that there are multiple reasons and that is just one of them. with how badly NA players perform and get thrown out for imports its no wonder player take the easy route and stream. in eu the players have hope to actually be relevant and may retire streaming.

hm73s04,RemoteAnalysis3809,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Im part of the community and I think Upset is a Chad for not succumbing to the public outrage and prioritizes his loved ones health and privacy over internet bullshit.  Adam and Bwipo can stay salty. Theyre not the ones getting backed by their employer.

hm7bp88,lKyou,11/26/2021,1,3971.0,Pls family emergency is what I used to say in highschool to dodge a test.  He didnt miss a day at school he bailed out on the freaking worlds possibly the most important part of all their careers. So yeah respect for the work accomplished to get to this moment calls for something just a bit less hazy than a generic family emergency(keeping in mind that he for sure doesnt need to share details if they are not close) But in the end we dont actually know what he shared with them.  Still if what Adam says is true then yes I understand his anger and yes you are right exposing this kind of internal matter on a twittlonger is uncalled for unprofessional and downright immature.
hm7pgew,Cyredvia,11/26/2021,1,7.0,Classic end if gay
hm79y1v,lppur3ps3,11/26/2021,1,4455.0,Yes it would but hes made clear multiple times its not directly about him its about a family member/something similar. Its literally not his to share and hes stated that. Sure it will make them feel better but it will also result in people harassing said people a lot (Happens a lot online twitch bots and even people just being terrible people). I dont give a shit about making my coworkers feel a little better if they cant trust the people Ive confided in that its a serious matter then thats even more justification to not tell them.   &#x200B  Im not saying to not be upset by it like bwipo clearly went through a lot hearing the news but I also dont see bwipo publically calling the decision into question.  I also dont see Bwipo saying it was for other reasons speculatively.   I also see people who literally hate fnatic and know more than us (Rich) defending fnatic. And I see people like Thorin also defending fnatic.  Everything points towards it being justifiable by Upset and what he did being for the most part correct. Yet somehow everyone is getting riled up about this and defending Adam for god knows what reason.   Be upset hes gone. Dont be a cunt.
hm7vynp,Cyanide-ky,11/26/2021,1,3.0,As a support main I hate when they get away I’ll give you a chance to get it but if it even looks like  they might get away I’m gunna kill them

hm762eu,rudebrooke,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Youre talking to teenagers most of the time remember.   Anyone with any kind of critical thought would understand that the situation warranted him leaving. If it didnt Fnatic would have released him because theyre not in the business of paying someone for a year in order to make worlds and then just have them leave last minute.   Anyone who thinks Adam - a guy who Upset has known and played with for about 3 months at that point - deserves to know the intimate details of Upsets familys personal life are completely out of touch.

I’m not sharing if my wife got cancer with my coworkers if that ever happened I’m any capacity.   A bunch of children on this sub that don’t understand privacy in any capacity and Adam is just as much of a child.

hm7un96,derbyt,11/26/2021,1,17.0,Youre relying a lot on your teammates being good enough to capitalize on advantages you give them as support (vision pressure peel lockdown). That simply doesnt happen in lower ranks. Once you get high Plat and higher Support gets easier. Im sure for someone like Dopa who rockets to those high ranks its an easier role. Personally I play a carry role until I get up to those ranks then return to being a support main.

hm6xsvn,maribri6,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Adam only wrote that because he wasnt trusted with anything and no one would tell him anything after the fact.  Its like a firefighter not putting out a fire and justifying it after by saying everything burned. Well yeah everything burned cause they didnt put it out.  In IRL sport you kinda abandon your privacy towards your teammates why? cause trust means telling people things. Not hiding it from them. Im not saying thats how it should be Im saying thats how it is.  Upset didnt wanna tell his teammates what was the problem therefore  the situation became super complicated for him and FNC management to explain to the others in the team. Especially cause you have hard time trusting someone who just said they didnt trust you enough to tell you things.  IMO the reactions weve seen show that FNC management were not able to handle the situation at all.
hm79ozb,Tittymotorboat,11/26/2021,1,84.0,Its just cringe. People use HLE as evidence that Chovy is always on bad teams while having a playbook of excuses for him being on giga stacked teams like DRX/GRF and still getting BTFO in quarters (3-0 and 3-1 not even competitive).

Is it Better way to learn the role? Do you think it limits learning due to lack of playstyle? ect... Also since you were just doing it for fun i assume you did not care about the pace of your cllimb. I think if you stuck to a smaller champ pool you could of avoided of lot of wasted games especially on jungle and climbed much faster. Thanks.

On the other hand I empathize with Adam because Ive played sports all my life and I would never question a teammate leaving in the conditions upset left. My problem is that upset then wanted to change the entire topside of the team without being upfront with them after pulling what he pulled at worlds he should have at least been honest about that.   And if you ask my opinion to me this simply seems mostly an org fuck up Im not even blaming the players

hm7r71e,Gilthoniel_Elbereth,11/26/2021,1,12336.0,This last week I’ve been so surprised and disappointed at the number of people gushing over Silco’s textbook manipulative behavior. He lied to Jinx gaslights her isolates her from her other loved ones tries to have her other loved ones killed makes her reliant on him etc. I think by the end he genuinely loved her as a daughter but that doesn’t mean their relationship isn’t extremely problematic bordering on abusive
hm8tqa1,w00ms,11/26/2021,1,10.0,They said that the next 2 champs are from PnZ but are not in Arcane that’s why they were pushed back because they felt releasing unrelated champs during the premiere would be weird. They did say they wre excited going forward to make champs out of characters in Arcane though.

hm7g9b0,Rumbleinthejungle8,11/26/2021,1,644.0,What? Making finals isnt useless. NA fans wish an NA team could get even close to smelling Worlds finals.   And no NA has never won MSI. EU won MSI in 2019 destroying NA in the finals.   You dont even know what you are talking about.

Insanity is doing the exact... same fucking thing... over and over again expecting... shit to change...  Your friend probably dosnt realize how bad he is and how many things he has to improve so he keeps trying the same thing over and over again.  &#x200B  You can see that happening at many different levels that why people get stuck in silver/gold/plat and even diamond.

hm785uy,moroheus,11/26/2021,1,42.0,You immediately jumped to the conclusion that Upset got cheated on but there is nothing that points to that. So that idea must come from somewhere else. Youre projecting you fear of being cheated and your misogyny into that situation.  So that is 80€ for the first session and 50€ for every additional. You wanna pay in cash or by card?
hm8sly1,Forward_Weakness8733,11/26/2021,1,20.0,i reccomend sett garen darius for starters yorick and nasus for splitpush lovers for begginers. Learn how to lane first before trying jungle as well. Maybe try more interesting champs like fiora riven irelia as they are known to be very good solo champions when you improve at the game. If youre willing we can stay in contact for consultation ^^

hm7dmhs,V1pArzZ,11/26/2021,1,17.0,Kayn and yi are both farming junglers. Both should probably fullclear then look to gank or take scuttle or invade then back and clear again. Yi has decent 1v1 early but shit ganks pre6. Kayn has shit 1v1 early but decent ganks pre6.
hm7qnuh,Odd_Play_5769,11/26/2021,1,11.0,Probably nothing more annoying than dying to Ekko Qs return even after hes dead. Whereas iirc Talon W comes back to him even if he dies but jt doesnt so any damage to the target (could be wrong about this one though)
hm8pjy6,Kilash4ever,11/26/2021,1,188.0,Just leaving my upvote lol. This is so well redacted  looks like u already got attention nice. Hope the best talon is really fun.
hm7mll9,Spitfire836,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,If I were in Upset’s place then yes I would expect to lose a portion of my privacy and would have told my teammates at the very least that there was an emergency and gone into a little detail about it (something that he did not do). You don’t have to go into every possible detail but a little more than just “family emergency” which is not even what he said to his teammates.   And also this could have easily been avoided if he has just been honest with his teammates from the start. The whole reason this blew up is because he was being “shady” about it. If he had just told his team what happened then they would have told everyone that he had an emergency and none of this would have blown up.

hm74jmc,swellbaby,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,There are people everywhere in the world who have little going on their lives and they handle that in some of the worse ways - by attaching themselves to something far greater than themselves. It happens with everything: political causes celebrities sports media literature hobbies whathaveyou. Easy access to echo chambers is some of the worst things internet gives society since it enables it and social media actually encourages it. Northern Europe is a tad more ambient when it comes to the mood of the masses and the amount of people compares to a handful of Southern cities but Im sure youd easily find some Swedes pulling this shit as well. Just the way some people are.

hm6yrng,Chao_Zu_Kang,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Even if that is true it has no relation to the issue at hand. Hopefully. But lets not get into some weird conspiracy theory about someone blackmailing Upset with something she did in the past to not play at Worlds...
hm713ol,Naerlyn,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,1) Lmao yeah no he doesnt give a fuck he left Worlds to go back to his girl   2) Lmao youve already got someone in the team who hovers his girls main for 30 seconds during every draft stop that bro its Worlds respect your teammates and the most serious one ends up teamless for 24€  Those are Kametos tweets the other three were deleted.

hm7tzw3,Lahwtiste,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Bwipo and adam say that they got told of his departure 12 hours before the start. What Upset said doesnt really contradict what they said since he said that he took the decision to leave when the situation got worse which was the day before worlds started.   They were probably aware that he wasnt well because of some issues as it was told in their worlds BTS video then again by Upset and again by dardo but they probably werent aware that it could end up with Upsets departure.   Unless Ive missed something where someone says word for word that at no point they were aware till the last moment what they all said still checks out.

hm8qew6,maidboy,11/26/2021,1,134.0,no they dont. i coach semi-professionally and i can tell you no one has a clue about the core mechanics of the game generally up until s11 euw master 500lp on servers like LAS etc no one has a clue except the very best pro players (average latin american pros are worse than your average euw/kr/cn gm player). ofc there are exceptions and ofc its not as black and white as understanding everything and being completely clueless but the game isnt played properly up until that point in terms of soloq. game quality in d1-500lp was a lot better in earlier seasons but elo inflation lowered the skill levels of all tiers. there is absolutely no reason to feel good about duo preseason dog server pisslow rank and the shiny badge shouldnt be enough to make this person post it to reddit.
hm87gmy,Nocturnezbreako,11/26/2021,1,106.0,Congrats you learnt that league rank means jack all in the real world hence your friends reacted like most would
hm8ohcl,tanezuki,11/26/2021,1,,Honestly I do not play her so I couldnt tell the twos I play in this class are Nasus and Sett (Mordekaiser and Trundle once in a while) and on Nasus specifically I prefer Thornmail for its defensive values.
hm8nzg6,LazerFruit,11/26/2021,1,17.0,id be shocked if a team with Spica and Tactical was serious in a setting like this. not to say they arent trying just that they are both huge memers its like expecting Meteos and Sneaky to not meme in game
hm7gl5n,--------V--------,11/26/2021,1,74.0,Fucking answer then? What could possibly have happened he won’t tell? Got cheated on? Ok almost everyone has been through that. Wife miscarriages? Ok well I’ve been through that also and would tell people. A death? Ok well the news reports on that also that’s life.   I can’t think of anything so devastating that you can’t even say the smallest of details to your teammates.   Yes I truly question his desire because if it were legit he could be vague and still let people know especially his teammates what happened.

hm7i07m,Hazakurain,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,There is no hate there? He is just laughing at Bwipo locking Kaisa and Upset supposedly leaving his wife when the whole persona of Kameto is being a loser nerd.   Thats not spreading the hate.
hm8fzxl,SageSpliter,11/26/2021,1,17.0,2 barrels will kill any champ that isn’t a 6k hp tank (pretty close lmao) so if you can just walk up and double double single combo 5 people you would get a penta. Not really easy/realistic but possible.   Ima say vlad or GP (perfect case scenario)
hm7q1yy,yonangks,11/26/2021,1,120.0,Probably the one where her R insta cancels for no reason after using your rotation too quickly.   She also has one that insta cancels her R when used after being hit by Sylas E Kassadin Q etc. Kassadins Q should act like a channel cancel but not in Katarinas case it completely silences her from using R for like 1-2 seconds after being hit with it.
hm7rkiy,CoalaRebelde,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Right? Adam and Nisqy arent just a name they are real people and got screwed by something they had no say in. I dont get why people are so against them venting their frustrations.

hm7lnn6,Odd_Play_5769,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Appreciate this response. You make a ton of points I agree with. On a few there is slight disagreeance between us but not opposition. I definitely have a romantic (here meaning unrealistic but in a idealized and pretty way) view and idea about teammates. And youre right that even in my professional life experience has taught me something different than the conception j had in my mind. That said I always did try to be sincere and honest with all teammates and coworkers regardless as to our standing personally or professionall. I suppose its easy to judge based on what I think should of been done especially in this instance when we have so little information.  I definitely think everyone could have handled it better but in my mind  the onus is on Upset to make this right at least with his teammates. And that even jf what Adam did was fucked Upset could have handled it way better. Appreciate you adding context to this point though: these players and frankly-at least as it seems to me- those in upper management in the organization are children. Lets be honest gamers arent the most socially well-adjusted people in the first place. It almost felt like no one at FNC took them all by the hand when Upset first brought up him leaving to the team and said here js how we handle this professionally especially for our teams public image. Most big offices have a person in HR and PR whos entire job revolved around this.   I also should say that some redditors insult another for writing a dissertation but I actually love reading someone complete thoughts like this for me the more details and clarity i have the better especially when debating that which is not neccesarily physical. Some things are not so simple sometimes you have to open up the idea and exhaust it from end to end with someone else so their is no ambiguity. I think we basically dis this. Take care friend
hm7z9ot,SkyFormal,11/26/2021,1,164.0,That’s why I really like URF. Usually much faster to finish the game and toxicity isn’t so bad because it’s just urf..
hm8p9wp,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,165.0,the lower the rank the more necessary. I usually mute the person the moment they say something not useful+toxic.
hm7czby,AlphaTenken,11/26/2021,1,39.0,I hear ya.  But would you want someone who doesnt want to be there play on your team. Maybe eventually if they were that good but with such a small team and season Id be more concerned their attitude would hurt us.
hm7q43y,DangerousSeaweed0,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,honestly  it just feels to me that most people here never worked hard for anything during their entire life  to understand just how shit it would feel to have that one dream uve worked hard towards  taken from you with no reason given

hm8pjkf,Psyr1x,11/26/2021,1,5.0,Hey always great to see someone interested in Lore.        [League Universe](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/) is the official site has all the stories bios comics and cinematics.        Theres an option to explore region by region thus reading all the champs and stories associated with each. Thus giving u a cohesive storyline. Theres also an option to read champion by champion.        An Explore option is also there for you to see the stories by release date.        You can also hop on the [Lore of Runeterra Discord](https://discord.gg/EbFjyvy) server bunch of people who are invested in lore who are always happy to welcome new people and help them along the way. There are intense discussions as well with theories abound. It is also somewhere you can choose to be notified when new lore drops. (We have a bot monitoring it.)        We also get the writers and members of the Lore division of riot so we sometimes get the inside scoop haha. Regularly communicate with Lead Narrative as well. Pretty big community and is honestly the best discord server Ive had the pleasure of joining. Ask for Aether or Taco (or anyone u see typing really) if you need help navigating.        In terms of where to start... honestly start with whatever interests you a champ a region. etc. Its best to go Region by region to get the whole story in context. But pop by the discord to get a read as you go type of vibe.

hm8tswl,butthurt-fanboy,11/26/2021,1,14.0,Sett is kinda strong a pretty usual juggernaut/bruiser.   But tahm he s a tank who doesnt have anything tanks have going for them in terms of lategame tahm has one of the strongest lane and if he s fed he will be a beast and u need 45 seconds of constant fighting to take him down but if he isn t fed he s the strenght of a super minion.  So imo definately tahm is more broken the max HP dmg on hit and the lack of dmg else where makes him hard to balance and a bad design

hm7tvkx,IAmDaleicious,11/26/2021,1,105.0,Regular season ROX Tigers Peanut was seriously one of if not the best jungler I’ve ever seen. Now when the playoffs came along he got out jungled by both Blank and Score in both those finals. He didn’t perform to the same standards at all.  In terms of raw peak junglers he’s easily in the convo with Canyon Tarzan Dandy and Kakao. Difference being that Canyon and Dandy carried their teams to world championships.

They and many legitimately think Jojo is that good.  &#x200B  With these things being said I hope Jensen can land on a team and take them to worlds. Hes one of my favorite players.

Literally the only reasons to justify his departure that I can off the top of my mind think of.  Dude legit just continues to say the exact same thing over and over and over again and hiding behind privacy  90% + people will move on with a simple but no details given explanation until he does fans will continue to bash him and his wife because so far the only details anyone has given is wife is lonely and until he refutes it with something legitimate this will continue to be contentious.     The fact that he helped remove his teammates using their performance as a reason after abandoning the team while not giving an explanation is what is truly stirring the nest.

hm81o1s,SterbenVII,11/26/2021,1,53.0,Smeb wasn’t undisputedly the best top for 2 years though. He was only the definitive best throughout the entirety of season 6 and half of season 7.   Summer 2015 - Ssumday wins split MVP and performed just as well as Smeb did.   Worlds 2015 - MaRin outperformed everyone.   Summer 2017 - Khan storms onto the scene and destroys the LCK.   Worlds 2017 (didn’t attend) - Cuvee peaks.  Spring 2018 - Kiin debuts as the best top laner in the LCK all the while TheShy smacked everyone in the LPL.  Smeb is obviously in contention for GOAT top laner but there are so many different variables to consider which makes GOAT top laner subjective due to the closeness of the best top laners. TheShy was the most dominant Smeb was the perfect top laner Khan has the most accolades and Impact has the longetivity.   Hell Impact could’ve snagged GOAT top laner status had he stayed in Korea IMO. He’s still a very good player despite the champion pool issues (which were a product of bad SoloQ so NA super server could help him). He’s played professionally since season 2 and has outlasted Smeb and Khan despite starting earlier than they did.

hm7c2xx,rudebrooke,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,Youre wrong again. His coach and the management of the teamkbew exactly what it was and they deemed it to be a sufficient reason to leave. This has been stated multiple times and its also been shown in that the coach and management chose to retain him despite him leaving.   Even if this wasnt the case your point of reasoning is illogical anyway.  Youre saying he could have said X instead of Y but shouldnt the same issue of subjective experience present its self in both cases? It sounds to me like youre arguing with yourself at this point.
hm81wnt,Whatvre,11/26/2021,1,2.0,pve? you dont need anyone in your party to play any gamemodes. If you mean having people on your team like random people just about every player who plays in bot mode are also bots because they are botting to sell accounts. Also if you just want to 1v5 the bots just make a custom game and add 5 enemies or however many enemies you want. Anyways you just dont need anyone to play
hm7thf3,hiccup333,11/26/2021,1,12336.0,Totally agree.  Act 1 was superb but I felt like the show didnt deliver on what it set up.  Felt very shortchanged at the end of the season.  Especially no resolution between the sisters thats what I stayed to the end for like they dangled that carrot all season then want you to to follow into season 2.  Individual seasons should be satisfying on their own
hm7cp54,Jonoabbo,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,Normally there isnt controversy because the people involved in professional sports are adults and not children so when people choose to keep it private their teammates respect that and dont post twitlongers about how their gf was the coach of the team or how despite Fnatic management agreeing the reason was good enough for him to leave he apparently left for no reason.

hm722k5,aithosrds,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,No you’re completely not understanding at all.  I could not possibly care less about “juicy details” or Upsets personal life.  My point is that the way it was handled caused more strife and drama than if he had given a vague statement as to the nature of the situation *WITHOUT* any specifics.  Something like “a family member is gravely ill and I need to be there” would have been more than enough.  He wouldn’t have had to say who or what or how serious or anything else.  We can assume that was the situation anyway but saying a “personal family issue” without any context created more strife and drama.  I personally don’t care but it’s undeniable that the situation was handled poorly and created hate and drama.  That’s negative for the team and I guarantee it was a factor in Bwipo leaving the team.  Oh and I’m in a position of leadership at my job and I’m *very* successful at it because I communicate openly.

hm8i2s1,WintersEnvoy,11/26/2021,1,307.0,When the server schism happened riot defaulted you into correct regions but you also got 1 free swap and basically everyone in sweden swapped EUW (there were memes surrounding why mostly like not liking playing with poles/russians although I had a friend say that and no spanish because apparantly swathes of spaniards swapped to euw not sure if true)  I was one of the last guys who even went to euw (of the old guard anyway) I had friends who insta went to euw and then back to eune and back to euw within 2 years but in the end every friend I played with went to euw except some finnish guy. Default creating accs was always in EUNE after the schism  &#x200B  But if you ever started to play league after this schism those players were mostly invited by old timers to play euw. So there was never a chance for most people to main an account on EUNE unless you started playing by yourself or through someone who did since everyone who joined the game via friend would eventually go to euw since thats where 90+ % of swedens playerbase is. I did have one friend who managed to play on eune until I think the start of this year before he finally swapped probably since his OG was one of those rare groups where people played by themselves rather than get invited by old timers
hm8gqwe,bad_at_riven,11/26/2021,1,7.0,Its not abnormal for supports to roam but there are specific times when they should try to avoid roaming unless the lane is really doomed (like if a big wave is crashing to ur tower they should avoid roaming incase of dive n u loose all gold/exp). Try to look at your map before you go in so you have an idea if you have back up or not. You can never control what the 4 other teammates do so the only option is to adapt yourself.
hm7a6eb,Latarnia40,11/26/2021,1,519.0,I remember when riot buffed galio in season 7. After they reworked him people played him as a tank so they buffed his ap scalings. He became the most broken champion in the game. His Q got a scaling % healt damage that scaled ridicolously. His orther spells got of hand too. After buing some ap your Q could oneshot enemies just by one tick without even being fed. It some how even got to the live servers! After a day they hotfixed him and it did not change a thing. Funniest s*it ever. Here is the Dumbs video on it: https://youtu.be/6PKKFfaPipU

hm8kl6j,tanezuki,11/26/2021,1,17.0,But marskmen CAN use AP items ?  They have the full value and the full passives of the items they take.  I really like AP Ezreal and its such a fun OTK burst build in URF and all the items works on his AP scaling abilities aka W E and R.  Youre mistaking items being class locked and just items not being worth due to AP/AD scalings.  Remember when Hydra was classlocked to melee users only ? They changed it.  While they didnt change Runaan for some reason (probably because itd has some very weird/broken implications) it shows that theres been cases where they decided to unlock classes restrictions. There is no set rule.  And if an Ezreal is allowed to use Ravenous Hydra as an ADC which is not at all a role close to being a bruiser why wouldnt the closest role to tanks shouldnt be allowed to use tank items ?  A juggernaut like Nasus can use literaly every tank item without their passive being locked except for Thornmail. By your logic he shouldnt use Spirit Visage as effective as tank and the passive increase of heal should be idk halved ? I could go on for every tank item like that as I said the vast majority of these items isnt having their passive locked for a good portions of the Juggernauts.  Edit : I just remembered another thing relevant here.   The newest tank item that we got Fimbulwinter has this specific close : Immobilizing or **slowing if you are Melee** an enemy champion consumes ...   They specificaly adressed the same issue for this Tank item so that Juggernauts witout hard CC can use it. Its literaly the exact same case except they thought about the issue and solved it for the item.

hm81hun,EnvironmentalBook,11/26/2021,1,11.0,Ive won so many games where a bunch of babies said its over. Its so annoying watching that guy spam surrender anytime something bad happens to him. Seems the only feeling people like from this game is completely smoking the enemy they dont want real challenge or competition. If they lose lane or even have a minor setback they are ready to quit. It doesnt help all coaches and guides teach selfishness and most people want the game completely balanced around having zero teamplay.  Just because you are doing poor doesnt mean the game is over all the time.

hm7ldap,Rikkimaaruu,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Yes its one of my all time classic games which i visit again and again.  I mean after Diablo 1+2 Starcraft and Warcraft 3 who would have thought that Blizzard would be in such a bad State in 2021. I never played WoW but i enjoyed Hots quite alot.  Realy a shame what happened to that Company.
hm8mw2s,AssetJason,11/26/2021,1,12.0,Zoom also mentioned that Yagao is the only player stay in JDG. Will Kanavi go to TES with Zoom?
hm729ao,Ok_Dot9858,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Should be sufficient that Fnatic management let him go. They are in charge and it they deem the issue big enough then it’s a sign of professionalism to trust their judgement.   In the end as they said they don‘t care about what happened just if it’s valid reason. There they should have been capable of getting their answer. But they didn’t and blamed their lack of maturity and professionalism on someone else
hm87gih,fschiltz,11/26/2021,1,15.0,What about Nauti ult? I feel its inconsistent and counterintuitive what happens if you or your ennemy died before it reaches the ennemey.
hm75p1s,Tittymotorboat,11/26/2021,1,74.0,Nope and they havent been all year.  Stop riding Chovys name
hm7azmn,Newfypuppie,11/26/2021,1,66.0,As a hard stuck 5 year plat good job and welcome to hell
hm7polj,LolWhatIAmDoing,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Bruh somehoe having 19 yo is not longer a child.   It amaze me how people seems to forget that at the age of 18 kids still partying till 7am with school at 8am giving 0 fucks. And miraculously 1 year later they are the most professionals dude out there.   Adam ate too much shit from upset and blew up pretty normal I would say. Your first year and worlds run get fucked by one dude 12h prior the tournament and you get the impression that that same dude is trying to change you saying you are not up to my standard (ofc we dont know this for sure yet it was Adam povs anyway).   And you tell me that you could do something better? Honestly as big as this blew up. All Adam did was speculate his gf felt lonely and honestly thats nothing too harsh in my book.   I would personally fuck upset myself but then I am no pro here.aaa
hm7nw4g,Pedobear2000,11/26/2021,1,,i mean... stuff always leaks. And someone from FNCs management might be more willing to share a rough outline of the situation with someone like Rich since he can be relatively certain that Rich wont run around blabbing about it atleast not to anyone who would go public with that info.  People always seem to be amazed how long-term industry personalities like Thorin Jacob Wolf or RL still get so much behind the scenes info but it is in part due to being viewed as someone who can be trusted with sensitive information.
hm816c9,thicccdaddyxd,11/26/2021,1,166.0,cuz that sweet sweet karma
hm7jck7,Jiffyyy,11/26/2021,1,92.0,and where I live my employer cannot ask for a reason its like things are different. are you not reading the same point I am saying?

hm78c3q,ACertainUser123,11/26/2021,1,42.0,If hes allowed his privacy then they should be allowed to be angry at him no? Same with us we dont need to know but it still sucks and some people get angry at that and thats okay.  I dont think we should know though.
hm8h200,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,118.0,what a coincidence. I am a big fan of you as well. When Im on a decent schedule I may consider streaming again but consistency is key and I havent been consistent. 💀
hm78869,killerlu45,11/26/2021,1,51.0,Mmm yes the the 49% wr champ is overturned...
hm75ytp,pseudolemons,11/26/2021,1,108.0,I think this behaviour is also related to League being a changing game. New champions runes and items make some of our (older players) acquired knowledge completely invalid but to us that feels like the game is to blame it is actively going against us and if we cant accept the games current reality it really hinders our improvement.  Ive actually felt this type of way recently because Ive been playing a lot with friends which led me to play some off role lanes like mid which I used to main back in season 3. The game has changed and my understanding of some of my favorite champions for that lane have also greatly changed. Suddenly I am not such a big bully with Leblanc and I can get pushed in easily. Vision is better across the board and so is survivability so my knowledge of whats lethal and how easily I can roam is also greatly outdated making me sometimes insanely frustrated with the game because my expectations were not met and my mental isnt as fluid to accept those shifts in perspective.
hm8hdwa,Sejjy,11/26/2021,1,169.0,So Im Diamond in ranked and have never played normals till a few days ago so my mmr there is like silver and bronze level. One thing i noticed from players there is just the emotional ability to deal with problems. Many are incapable of seeing what they did wrong let alone have the mechanical and situational awareness to achieve the correct decision.   Assuming this person is somewhat mature (kinda doubting since the raging) then the only thing he can do from there is rewatch his games. In the heat of the moment you dont know what could have been done better and just tunnel vision on what you think is right. Hiring a league coach is honestly pretty cheap compared to how much time he spends on it and Im sure even just a game or two would help his fundamentals a lot.   He needs someone to objectively tell him what he is doing wrong and probably to shut up in game. You can easily carry yourself out of low gold on a good champ (solo) without saying a word. The fact he is putting money into it is probably the one thing that will make him take it seriously so it be worth it. If not then hes a lost cause who just wants something to vent.
hm7x4l2,JackoRecko,11/26/2021,1,8.0,Level doesn’t relate to skill just hit level 30 and play a bit of ranked and see what elo you’re put in
hm75p10,AsahiMizunoThighs,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,like adam about upsets wife?
hm8jnxn,Zophixious_,11/26/2021,1,12350.0,Happy I watched this not knowing a thing about LoL because I thought anyone could die at any given moment. Apparently a lot of the characters are in-game champions that were unlikely to be killed off. But... now that I know that I guess that ignorance for the second season wont be there. Whoops.
hm78tn3,Neeroodle,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Because it’s unfair to their teammates? You don’t exist by yourself in a vacuum when you play a professional sport. Also find me an example of a teammate leaving in a high profile case where there is controversy like this over the reason why they left being unknown.
hm84l39,moody_P,11/26/2021,1,3.0,is this the we pretend we didnt buy the same items on everyone in season 10 episode again? Im tired of this rerun

hm86g8v,RedditChad420,11/26/2021,1,1.0,typical lazy rito honestly theyre just pandering to mana players really

hm8doat,Jiffyyy,11/26/2021,1,150.0,its no ones place to demand answers if he has already stated he wishes to keep his private life private.
hm7gmj3,Fgame,11/26/2021,1,1301.0,I trust them both. I trust that Upset told Yamato what was going on. I trust that due to the sensitive nature of what was going on Adam Bwipo and Nisqy werent told WHAT the issue was. Now if they were completely in the dark thats on Yamato IMO. But in no world does Upset have to reveal all that information and in retrospect it was a fantastic idea not to since I HIGHLY doubt it would have been good enough of a reason for them.
hm7e1cs,Rhadamantos,11/26/2021,1,42.0,Betrayed!

hm7brf1,Barfmeister,11/26/2021,1,1095.0,Its definitely not the only thing that makes any sense. For example my most likely interpretation is that he feels the details are not actually for him to divulge because the tragedy happened primarily to his wife and he is protecting her privacy not just his own.
hm77fmb,Agreeable_Junket_271,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,no you dont got it lol. youre deliberately being obtuse.  yes syntactically its slightly different but semantically it takes a whole other meaning. one implies life threatening danger the other implies basically nothing.
hm6zo4n,Exclarius,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,> It is the teams responsibility to inform the fans and as a member of the team it is Upsets responsibility to make sure the fans are not left completely in the dark.  From the linked tweet:  > Over the course of two weeks there were two meetings where I had expressed to the team that I was dealing with **severe family issues** that have impacted me deeply. It was only on the night before my departure that the situation at home took a turn for much worse leaving me with no other choice than to leave. I have always been transparent about the severity of the suffering my family was going through.  You do know why he had to leave. Severe family issues should be enough. You do not need to know the exact details. It is not relevant.
hm7hqum,sscyth1,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,like what this traumatic shit that could happened there was no deathi nvoloved like what his gf got into  fight with his family or what

hm7d5cr,Sycherthrou,11/26/2021,1,64.0,Youre not meant to be looking at the overall winrate which includes people that are running aftershock for all I know. Look at the winrate of the rune.  Fair point on different site. everyone seems to use u[.gg](https://o.gg) and I forget.
hm8fwk4,RobinsEggPoacher69,11/26/2021,1,3.0,This is Reddit. Contact riot. All we can do is shitpost.
hm7h264,Tweddlr,11/26/2021,1,47.0,Hey your career is most likely going to be over in six years do you want a $5m 3 year contract or a $1.5m 1 year?
hm8fk4o,redraz0r,11/26/2021,1,183.0,Throwing money away for a buyout when your team is already bleeding money every year simply doesnt make sense. At the end of the day the teams are businesses. It sucks that hes stuck in contract hell but it makes sense why hes teamless. Its really easy to say LCS doesnt care about winning but the top teams are throwing millions at players and not getting an ROI. You can only do that for so long
hm70yaa,galop1337,11/26/2021,1,133.0,Super talented people. Especially the bass-guy! Is there a live version of this as well?
hm7udxz,EH0_0,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Noone is saying thay people and management do not care about other people in the team as well. Obviosuly everyone is still affected. But if some emergency happens and you need to deal with it on such a short notice you cant do anything about it but to deal with it. Do you want to be in Upsets situation and affecting your team like that while also dealing with a very important family emergency? Or do you want to be his team member in that situation? It just sad all around
hm83scn,Suspicious-Bus6351,11/26/2021,1,,He isn’t.

hm6xt9k,bluesound3,11/26/2021,1,119.0,Almost every NA player gets slaughtered internationally thats a really bad reason. Theres like a handful of NA players that dont get clapped at worlds or MSI. Also Xmithies laners very often fucked him over by just hard losing lane or getting outroamed.

hm7sds8,DeeWongsta,11/26/2021,1,253.0,Ye that’s fair. I can understand that. I’ve liked jinx from the beginning her personality and character design. Then Arcane came out and revealed she had a tragic childhood which resulted in how she is now. It makes sense completely understand how she went from Powder to Jinx buuut I would have liked jinx more if they revealed her as always being crazy instead of giving her a tragic past. It reflects real life too much which to me personally is not as interesting. I do get that people don’t just become crazy out of nowhere but Jinx isn’t a real person and so she wouldn’t NEED to have a reasonable explanation as to why she is the way she is. I tend to be drawn towards the crazy/psychotic characters but as soon as their life starts to reflect real life I lose a bit of interest in them I guess ?  I’ve had this discussion with friends and they all  disagree/ think my opinion makes no sense. I think the majority have the same opinions as my friends so it was refreshing to read your comment :)
hm7g6nx,Dann93,11/26/2021,1,1301.0,Why dont you start sharing first then?

hm7lkeu,calife89,11/26/2021,1,13.0,Think he meant to say some people manage their waves so taking the farm disrupts their strategy. Some people just get mad though. As support if I don’t have item gold I’ll just stay in lane and last hit to gain exp or freeze lane for adc when they get back supports are usually always behind in levels so it helps) but some adcs/laners get pissed just for last hitting. Same vibes when I push a wave that a laner abandoned “you’re a support why are you pushing a wave”.. cause it’s crashing into our tower while you roam for kills and there’s this thing called laaate game
hm7wsx2,MapPotential9009,11/26/2021,1,246.0,He shouldnt even take damage at all going off what his character is. It should just cost mana post level 5. Its dumb
hm734qj,PacMannie,11/26/2021,1,119.0,What makes me think Jojo can succeed is a lack of competition. Now that Jizuke/Jensen are out of the league what mid is going to punish Jojo in lane? I do think it’ll take time for him to adjust but I wouldn’t be too surprised if he ends up the 3rd-4th best midlaner in LCS.
hm7sc6l,12thBlessing,11/26/2021,1,1546.0,[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Le1IvjEbXQ) for the curious. I wouldnt take this as Tyler saying that he knows exactly why Upset left but that he knew about a lot of drama happening within FNC.
hm71t60,Rektile7,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,To be fair FNC management is a... special breed
hm7ls2x,camcrazy00,11/26/2021,1,13.0,Heres what youre missing wave management has nothing to do with the laner being there all the time the best time for setting up waves is when there NOT there. The last thing most laners want is there minions pushing while there not there.   &#x200B  If the wave is frozen then when they get back they get to be there and push an even bigger wave under the enemy tower if you push it however by the time they get back the wave is just gonna be in a stalemate it doesnt hinder them perse but it takes away from the protentional push under the tower.
hm7g13u,dkoom_tv,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,illegal for harassing HAHAHA I mean yeah its illegal now enforce it
hm8njbb,aglimmerof,11/26/2021,1,165.0,Thanks for the reply!  Also you mentioned Rakan in another comment. I’ve never known if he is intended as an enchanter with enchanter items or a kind of tanky engage/disengage champ. What gave you the most success?   He kind of feels like Taric in that sense.
hm8opmb,WintersEnvoy,11/26/2021,1,128.0,I forget which year but back with DL being in the roster and TL winning every other split TL was like top 3 worst spending compared to results roster in LCS according to Travis (comparing the wage of a teams players to actual wins)
hm6ylr5,Mohikanis,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Youre forgetting Rekkles was under contract in G2 so theres like 0.05% chance he was on the market available to Fnatic lol.
hm79fdm,TSMShadow,11/26/2021,1,3.0,I will say the new “prismatic” aesthetic of their thumbnails recently is kinda cool.
hm7n4ag,EmilianoR24,11/26/2021,1,6.0,Well it isnt like skarner is the best duelist out there either and jg is the least 1v1 role there is

hm758bs,jalf99,11/26/2021,1,22.0,Its obvious why. Money.  Imagine youre a 20 something adult and youre told by an org they will give you thousands maybe millions of dollars every year for 3 years?  Especially in a business like e-sports where who knows when youll retire?
hm7fb8d,alasca_sugar,11/26/2021,1,75.0,congratulations )o))
hm6zo2m,Exspyr,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,The thing I dont get is that as far as Im aware he never talks from the perspective of how gutted he was personally to miss what hed worked so hard for. Same goes to his team mates just doesnt seem to be any passion for words like its just yeah sorry calling in sick today kinda shit. Might be a massive misread by me but there doesnt seem to be much personal drive or understanding of the drive of his team mates. Like its the biggest fucking thing and this seems so reserved. Idk.

hm6y62p,elikaweli,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Already said it somewhere else but: Upset didnt ruin everyone. He has no reason why he should say sorry for making such a tough decision. In the end it is not his fault that a family emergency happens. Could happen to everyone.

hm7d7in,Grothas,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,I dont think so. Adam brought this up hes pretty much the childish person here theres no special obligation to share your familys personal problems with team mates - you dont tell other peoples secrets to a third party just because someone worked hard.

hm6z9pc,197326485,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Peoples issue with his teammates not knowing is that they want the teammates to spill the beans so they can know. Its just morbid curiosity and hes taking a lot of heat over it.

hm7jowx,idobrowsemuch,11/26/2021,1,540.0,Its not that crazy and i wouldnt want to see it on morde but maybe on another champion?   Mordes Q (rather than a big bonk) used to be that his mace would turn into a flail and hed stick it into the ground. he could then recast Q and the skill would change based on the position of the mace head relative to morde. Like if you were standing to the side he would do a massive sweep standing in front would make him do a massive slam like current Q etc.
hm77sbj,Old-Position6876,11/26/2021,1,85.0,hey remember how funny it was when literal fascists weaponized a bunch of stupid teenagers on the internet to uncritically spout their propaganda under the incredibly flimsy guise of fucking journalism ethics  hilarious
hm7yuvs,northerncass,11/26/2021,1,130.0,>Ok almost everyone has been through that. Wife miscarriages? Ok well I’ve been through that also and would tell people. A death? Ok well the news reports on that also that’s life.   yup because youve experienced it and dealt with it your way means that other people should react in the same way you do.   god americans are so stupid its comical.
hm7d5b0,zaplayer20,11/26/2021,1,,Perkz when he left G2 said what was the reason Mikyx when he had wrist issues said what the reasons where many players even if they lie say some reasons to justify their absence. Upset claimed family issues which can mean many things or nothing at all. Anyway at least now some players know learned about Upset and Adam and Bwipo and Nisqy conflicts that resulted in Fnatic having a trash worlds participation. I also do feel Upset made issues harder for fnatic fans to understand by suggesting the change of almost the entire line up for him to be great. Had a similar team in 2020 and managed to poop himself in the end. I must mention i dont have twitter nor reply to him or his family i post here where i know he wont read nor he would care about my opinion. So dont hate me for having an opinion.

hm7yryu,nizzy2k11,11/26/2021,1,277.0,idk what the network is like but a much bigger factor is how easy it is to deal with the laws around the data and commerce of the server. they might be able to get much better ping somewhere else but the cost of moving/taxes might make it impossible from a business standpoint. the RU server has a massive problem retaining players already they have given away loads of shit there for years to get more players to play there and not on EU.

hm7g73b,Amsement,11/26/2021,1,144.0,Doesnt mean he thinks Jensen is bad. Could mean he doesnt think Jensen is worth the price youd pay to get him which is something he has said before. What youre doing is just putting words in his mouth for no good reason.
hm8br6c,After_Signature_6580,11/26/2021,1,2.0,Thats a great way to get your main permabanned
hm84573,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,92.0,ADs dont sack early enough and dont farm enough later. Most ADs will just die to a jungle gank to get a couple of minions. Later in the game they wont maximize their farm. AD is all about income since you spike HARD but at 3 items and most ADs cant even make it to that stage to carry.
hm7apm9,moroheus,11/26/2021,1,50.0,Now look at it. There are 100 things that could have happened. The question is why is your first idea... yoyoyo wait you havent even paid the previous session. Wtf is this youre trying to screw me over or what
hm745zg,Odd_Play_5769,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,Stop creating imagined scenarios: if I were in Upsets scenario no situation could possibly take me away from the obligation I gave my teammates. If though I simply had to leave because of it 12 hrs before the biggest game of our life given what the word teammate means to me and given everything worlds means to them there is nothing in this situation I would not tell my teammates and every detail they could ask Id give. I dont know hardly anything but I know this
hm77cj0,Melodias07,11/26/2021,1,74.0,Thats only what they do tbh even back in GRF days Chovy wasnt the star on that team.
hm758jd,Grandmafelloutofbed,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,I mean what else is the reason? If a family member died why not just say that? Like ya know? Why is it such a big secret if its something that cant be solved with.  My mom passed away I need to go home or something along those lines.
hm7vy0h,vegeful,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,My friend had use family emergency as an excuse for waking up late to his boss. Family emergency is too broad and overuse.  People from 21 until the day of retired had use family emergency and their emergency can be as small as waking up late still drunk or the real emergency.

hm7s7cw,ConscienceNot,11/26/2021,1,21.0,I think this is very in line with that kind of thinking. With that shit you can directly finish the work and delete Rengar altogether.
hm7pih6,-LostInCloud-,11/26/2021,1,,>as it stands  to me personally  this looks like upset knew that those players wont be on fnc next split  so he didnt wanted them to have info that they could use to shittalk him when they are thrown of the team  even more so if he had a hand in replacing them  Even if thats the case that would be a perfectly reasonable decision to make on Upsets part. The chance of getting the stuff leaked is just ... too big.

hm8no31,saltyfruitz,11/26/2021,1,5.0,[Map](https://map.leagueoflegends.com/en_US) of Runeterra. I used this a lot when I first started getting into the lore.  [This](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/champions/) website has all of the champs and their related stories. Just click on one of them to read their bio. Most champs also have a story to read along with them too.   [Comics](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/comic/) are really interesting and easy to read as well. I recommend the [Lux](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/comic/lux/issue-1/0/) comics or the [Zed](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/comic/zed/issue-1/0/) comics.

hm7z4q0,Soleah,11/26/2021,1,55.0,Depends on your elo.  Supports do prepare cs for your adc under tower for example so they should/do know how to cs.  Couple that with a roaming champion and supports can do just fine in mid.  Its really not that hard to play a predator malz or veigar for example.
hm7j60p,PresentMiddle8974,11/26/2021,1,92.0,No its just not justifiable he wouldnt share atleast vague details with his teamates who he fucked over after they had worked so hard for a chance of a life time. And then behind the back trash talking/replacement of the top lane after he single handedly ruined their worlds. Doesnt sit very well with me at all tbh.
hm836kk,SocialistScissors,11/26/2021,1,3.0,I checked and it is true for both Astronaut Veigar and rammus. Im guessing it is true for the other ones aswell.  Both have rise  trying to figure out the rest.  Edit: Veigar is To their Surprise He returned
hm8crbg,ajkeence99,11/26/2021,1,1194.0,No thanks on Jensen and EG would be dumb to give up Danny for DL.
hm8l23r,DankMasterJake,11/26/2021,1,205.0,Thats fair I guess. IMO I just think the gap between Bjerg/Fudge and Core/(Winsome/Isles) outweighs the potential ceilings of Summit and Berserker.
hm71njn,Sarazam,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Also he says that he told Yamato what happened but from [this video]( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jJQqz80qF2w&t=1366s) Yamato talks about Upset leaving. When talking about Upset leaving he said that he knows it must be super important because Upset is a competitor and would not give up and leave for nothing. If Yamato knew the reasons wouldn’t he be phrasing it as “Upset told why he considered leaving and I knew he needed to go home and deal with it.” Not to psycho analyze too much but it feels like Yamato doesn’t know much and is rationalizing that it must be super important because Upset wouldn’t just leave the team.

hm7vib1,RaiseYourDongersOP,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,I mean no joke its pretty disgusting. So many people on Reddit focusing on whether Upset should have told his teammates or not but the most fucked up thing that happened was Adam making this public and saying shit like maybe his gf was lonely? or something like that.
hm7c3oa,AkosThe,11/26/2021,1,3.0,Honestly most veteran players hate on it but download facecheck or the u.gg app. Sure it will have a negative effect at the beginning cause you have preset runes and items but you can learn why thats the current meta while playing and shopping and getting used to the new items is way easier if you have a crotch. Just dont lean on it for too long.    Now adcs are pretty much the same. If you get fed you are the strongest thing in the world like twitch one hitting the enemy team. If you arent fed... too bad you are pretty much useless.  Are tanks meta? I dont think so. You have enough items to counter them. Im not into that type of league enough to tell you whats The Meta but in my experience bruisers are pretty great like olaf trynda gwen yone etc.
hm7dgry,Epamynondas,11/26/2021,1,29.0,idk if this is what he means but since LPL is on every day of the week with different teams playing each day each team has a different schedule of training days/days off i would assume for long breaks like the lunar new year schedules line up more
hm8503r,Jiffyyy,11/26/2021,1,143.0,I dont have any opinion on the matter what is it you are referring to?

hm74qvb,Aparter,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,I do not feel sorry for any of them both did things that harmed the other party. It is not like one case is more redeemable than another. Time for everyone to admit it and move on.
hm7z19o,sieer,11/26/2021,1,277.0,Would love it I switched over to eune cause a few friends who aren’t playing anymore and I’m stuck here cause it’s hard to convince my friends that I dragged into playing league to spend that much money to go to euw. :D  Pretty much gave up playing ranked lately too much people spamming in their own language from lobby with no regards for anyone else and then just afking if they die 2 times

hm810h8,Odd_Play_5769,11/26/2021,1,3.0,Also they cant show it before draft because it will dictate draft. Both teams will be drafting around synergy with soul point or just generally whatever buff the drake gives naturally. Its too game warping. Besides j like the RNG-lite we get with it

hm7a791,mit_dem_bus,11/26/2021,1,121.0,You think TL want him to sit on the bench for 2m a year?   Theres a chance Jensen doesn’t want to lose $1m a year to play for a bottom tier org.   There’s more than just the buyout here. Teams would have to pay Jensen close to what he’s actually making from the bench for him to be interested too. Plus he’s already stated he doesn’t want to play on a shit roster

hm76bv2,RemoteAnalysis3809,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,For real people need to stop re-hashing this point and accuse Upset or Adam of lying because anyone with reading comprehension can understand that one side gave only the severity of the situation while the other wanted specificity.

hm721jg,Seneido,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,> Is Upset the one who convinced Fnatic management to go for Perkz / Humanoid?  we cant know the future and ofc nisqy is to blame for his performance as well but with upset decision the team imploded and looked terrible. ofc the same could have happen if he stayed but giving the circumstances we can assume that upsetts decision was the nail in the coffin for 3 members.

If your reasoning for needing time off isn’t sufficient even as a burger flipper plenty of people will dig you for it.  Anything that remotely complicates someone else’s life gets met with pushback and support it’s the nature of humans and thinking the world revolves around them.

hm77a7k,Random_Stealth_Ward,11/26/2021,1,51.0,Guess The visuals of the passive may be tied to the spells hitting Champion rather than the spell actually affecting the Champion but that is kind of a weird situation then.  There are some cases of effects ignoring stuff like blocks because the only condition is that they hit something but its usually not just visually. For example soraka hitting Spellshielded targets with Q activates her Q passive even though the spell didnt affect them.  Maybe a similar case happens with Talon P and while the passive assumes every hit counts the condition itself remains as damage the enemy and so only the visuals appear.

If he is going to start making twitlongers and going into meltdown every time either of those things happen its going to be a rough career.   He is well within his right to be upset or frustrated with the situation but he is hardly justified to be mad at anybody.
hm7ftr0,babylovesbaby,11/26/2021,1,,Indeed I get that but you cant really justify being angry at someone for not speaking English if you dont speak *their* language. It certainly makes communication in some games harder when people have the ability to speak a common language but refuse but thats their right - they can speak whatever language they want just like you can.
hm6z2ms,Delphoxe,11/26/2021,1,11.0,I much prefer tanks supports over enchanters with Jinx. Between get excited her Q passives and attack speed stacking I feel like her attacks do more than enough. The ability to all in the early game with chompers is a huge advantage.

hm76ql3,supern00b64,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,All his family members? Do we have a sources for that? Also how would you define everyone is ok? Maybe the family member in question kept it secret on social media.  Its still very possible he lied. If we assume fnc coaching was okay with him leaving as is everyone in the scene who knows of his situation were also assuming upset lied to all of them.  Ultimately we just dont know but I would still stand on the side of charitability. If it really was all a farce and he really just went home because of his wife then when it leaks we can do the memes but before we know that id say nah lets be chariable.

hm7u07d,Adventurous-Sport-45,11/26/2021,1,19.0,I dont think Mel could *be* Rell unless they completely changed Rells appearance *and* backstory around. And while there have been some changes (Caitlyn looks a little different Ekko has a different hairstyle hextech is much newer) generally speaking most of the characters look very much like their game counterparts. And yeah they are both Black Noxians is not much to go on by itself.   However I think there is too much that hints at a possible connection or inspiration to dismiss out of hand. That is we cannot discard the possibility that the characters are related Mel took inspiration from Rell and so forth.  In general Mel is from Noxus she has a mother who is a high-ranking Noxian and who is focused on her children being strong and ruthless above all else and at any cost and her name is just one phoneme different from Rell. That would be enough to make one wonder whether the writers of *Arcane* were at least thinking of Rell when they made her character even if they had no in-story connection or Rell did not exist in *Arcane*.   But most importantly at the end of the final episode when Jinx fires her rocket at the council chamber Mels golden accoutrements start glowing. That just screams metalmancer to me (look at how Rells hair and metal glow). And (correct me if I am wrong) so far only one champion is a metalmancer *at all*. Not in Noxus but at all and thats Rell. It still seems unlikely that she *is* Rell but there sure are a few similarities between them.  Of course the flip side is that the show has apparently been in development since 2015. Rell was released in 2020 so the writers must have at least had the general idea for Mels character before Rell was released and possibly since before her character was in development. I mean Mels role is not minor: she helped jumpstart the development of hextech helped get Jayce on the council and remove Heimerdinger later entered a romantic relationship with him and is the catalyst for Ambessa (and Noxus by extension?) coming to Piltover.   So they had to have had her in there from a fairly early stage which means that if there were any connection between Mel and Rell Mel would almost certainly have had to come first.
hm79tms,CasperVadiem,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,This is exactly the same bullshit of the twitlonger but without all the repetition and typos in other words a wall of text with nothing in it and not even denying what happened. This gives more validation to what Adam and Nemesis said about FNC and Upset in other words leaving the team right when they were going to play at worlds the most important tournament just to be with his wife completely unprofessional and even more for a girl that has a horrible reputation in her home country.

hm7dxvu,Adleyy65,11/26/2021,1,,No in the end he settled for a pretty reasonably amount. Its reported to be a 600.000 buy out which seems fair and is significantly lower then what it was supposed to be at the start.
hm7izoo,Proterragon,11/26/2021,1,,OK didnt expect a serious response on reddit so I will apologize for snarkiness in my first reply seemed warranted at the time.  My point here is that teammate is just a term for someone who is in the same team as you. Thats it. There are different kinds of teams and there are as many different kinds of teammates as there are different people. I understand that some people presume that being teammates automatically means a deeper and closer connection but IMHO that Is a childish immature and naive position of someone who either hasnt had many real life experiences (especially as a member of a team) or simply has a romanticized notion of being a team. Or possibly (or even usually perhaps) both. Now they are probably not to be blamed for this. Modern media loves to portray sports teams as some kind of families or comrades in arms. But as it usually happens real world is not like that. And there is a direct correlation between being more experienced being in the industry (any industry) longer and knowing that your team members are not always your friends. In most cases actually its just business.  Whole drama here is that Adam is an immature unprofessional 18-19 year old (btw BIG NOTE HERE let that sink in hes a fucking teen with no life experience let alone knowledge of business etiquette or procedures). And being an immature teen that he is he overreacted mishandled his at least partially justified frustrations behaved unprofessionally took it personally when his team explored other options for his position and generally shat the bed with his childish behavior.  On a wider point about community this community as well is full of immature childish people who do not understand what Is professional and what isnt and to whom does Upset owe an explanation and to whom does he not.  Last thing Adam did react unprofessionally and immaturely without thought of influence he wields and the consequences that his TL will lead to. That does reflect on him badly but he is still very young this is his first 6 months in any professional environment and he has space to learn so I dont hold it against him too much. Just think that he is being a baby about it and thats it.

But people are legitimately soft inting every game or just have no clue what they are doing. It might be people playing off-role but it is markedly worse than say 2 months ago.   For example I had today a Leona who had the least damage taken in the entire game and a Malzahar who didn’t use his ultimate until 20 min in the game
hm7lb06,Cassereddit,11/26/2021,1,126.0,The rune provides you with an item every few minutes early on with which you can instakill any type of minion (no matter how many HP they have left) and you permanently gain more damage towards that type of minion for the rest of the game.

Adams a giant bitch for airing his dirty laundry online.

Yamato word for word said he shared some details with me but I dont need to know everything.  Clearly what Upset shared with him was enough for the coaching staff to agree with the decision.

hm75yh3,kazuyaminegishi,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Upset *has* been transparent about whats happening. The transparency is the family emergency.  Bwipo Adam and Nisqy simply dont believe thats the case so they want to know exactly what the emergency is. Its like when a coworker you hate calls in sick so you now have to do double the work your first thought is I bet theyre faking sick and they just went on vacation regardless of what the truth is. For you you wont believe it until they come to work the next day and see them coughing up a lung (the you being a hypothetical person).  Adam and Co are this hypothetical coworker. Its not that Upset didnt convey that he had an emergency Its that he didnt convey what this emergency was so they could decide for themselves if it was severe enough for him to leave them high and dry.  The complications of the situation are that Upset is right to keep his private life private regardless of the effort he and his teammates put into this year he prioritizes his family over a trophy and thats his prerogative.  His teammates who are not in this situation prioritize the trophy over Upsets family problems so they are right to be angry that something that doesnt involve them killed their tournament.  The issue comes in that theyve made this frustration a public issue instead of a private one and no amount of justification can explain that. They should have put on the big boy pants told management that Upsets conduct made him unreliable and said us or him or moved on. Hes never going to tell them what happened and getting the public to bully him into doing so by spreading conspiracies about his wife is childish and vile.

hm6z75s,-LostInCloud-,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Keep in mind here in Germany (or Europe generally) we tend to do things a bit differently than you folks do in America.  A employer or even teacher would not even be legally allowed to ASK about it if theres a sick note for example.  Upset is not slave and should be treated accordingly.  >Upset didnt trust his teammates to tell them but he expects his teammates to trust him to not need the details.  Upset told multiple members of team and staff offered to tell Hylli. Given what Adam and Bwipo now did he was right not to trust them.  Either way its not like hes asking them to trust him they dont have any right to know in the first place.  Fucking Americans man what do you expect from a society that cant even give people health insurance.
hm7a7kc,lppur3ps3,11/26/2021,1,4455.0,Also to add I would also never ask people to tell me especially people Ive known less than a year that I may not particularly like or trust to that degree. I want to build trust with colleagues in work related things. Not divulge personal things and trust them in that sense. If anyone at work like or hate had to leave due to an urgent matter and would seriously fuck up the business I dont care if they tell me. Sure it would give me less questions but Im not expecting answers or being annoyed at there not being answers.
hm7zqtd,Braunze,11/26/2021,1,11.0,I mean the Korean server is pretty notorious for going next fairly fast and theyre some of the best players in the world.

hm897pe,josluivivgar,11/26/2021,1,115.0,at least for TL they just showed with alphari that theyre willing to be lenient and not screw over their players I guess?  so if you do well you get $$$$$$ if you dont then you still get more than a one year contract and get to negotiate to leave to another team.  (theres also a good chance that salaries have peaked with some good players not getting chances because of high salaries so an extended contract is great for a player in a market that might be adjusting next year)  now if I was signing with G2 I would definitely not sign anything more than a 1 year contract.

Not to mention Adam legitimately showed he cant keep this issue to himself and that is he too immature to not accidently (or through an emotional reaction) spill the beans about the actual details if he knew.

But the quality can only decay to a certain point until even those who are addicted such as myself such as a lot of league veterans have had enough and are simply forced to move on. We havent quite hit that point yet but its on the horizon. Im not surprised leagues player count has been going up. Im sure it will for some time. But give it 5 years tops. If Riot doesnt start to focus on making a good game instead of an entertaining one people are going to start to notice and that player count graph is going to pull an uno reverse.
hm77u8c,2poundWheel,11/26/2021,1,74.0,Kingen was a monster in 2020 summer (I believe couldve been 2021 Spring memory is hazy) and now that he actually has teammates (last year he had a terrible coach drafting him into garbage positions Pyosik who is the most up and down jungler in the league Jett(Plex) who just didnt make sense and was a plug-and-play bandaid for the team while having a rotating door of botlanes  The topside of Peanut and Doran doesnt inspire a lot of confidence.  Kiin  Rascal (If he plays even close to his level in Spring)  Zeus  Doran/Kingen/Canna  Sword/Dove  is my honest opinion. If Dove gets swapped for Howling then it gets more dangerous for Doran. My point isnt that Doran is bad its that Doran is not a super-team material player (very few are..hence super team) The phrase super team is getting beaten to death the last few years.
hm7aiwy,ceyx0001,11/26/2021,1,4455.0,Im not even sure what your point is? People CLOSE to Upset understand that playing worlds is his dream. Are they work buddies or not? Is this a job like you had in mind that you can simply just leave or not? If they are how should Adam be able to know if the only communication he got was that Upset had to leave without being communicated the severity of the situation.
hm82s0h,Ebobab2,11/26/2021,1,62.0,> maw of malmortious isnt a good item on go in supports (and barely on most go-in midlaners) ~ so them pinging it is just a sign that they dont believe your item is reasonable.  99% they just ping it because they want to shift the blame on you and your item choices while completely abandoning any of their contributions to their game
hm7nbgs,Skylam,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,But they dont have the right to air it all publicly and obviously incite a witchhunt...
hm7cbrm,Barfmeister,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,THANK YOU. To me it seems so obvious that this is the case. The details are not just his to divulge he is protecting the privacy of his loved ones and is prepared to take the consequences from that. In terms of communication with his teammates Im sure he could have handled it better but its also a high bar to set if you expect someone going through something traumatic to also be a perfect communicator during that time. My general takeaway from this is that Upset seems like a person with great integrity and care for those closest to him.

His idea of what good management is and what FNC should have done I guess.      Translation for those that dont speak french as he answers someone asking him what hed do if one of his players did the same as Upset (according to adam twitlonger) :      I take his passport and phone when we arrive if you want to leave you better have a good reason.

He doesnt need to share many details or specifics but thats way too fucking generic. Obviously some of his teammates were not satisfied at all with the flimsy explanation. Which could be the fault of the org and not upset himself.

hm7auor,Amsement,11/26/2021,1,125.0,I dont remember LS saying hes bad. He just said that Jensens play for most of the season looked like he was checked out which is something other people have said as well iirc and could be sentiment TL shared if they were willing to replace him with Bjergsen who has been out of it for a year. I havent seen any notable person in the scene say that Jensen isnt good enough but rather that the price tag for him probably isnt worth it for a lot of teams. Theyd be paying whatever the buyout is + his salary unless Jensen is willing to settle for a lower salary which is unlikely. If teams are aiming to get salaries to more reasonable points I dont really blame them for not picking up Jensen.

hm7p2mr,Broken_Reality,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,If Adam hadnt run his mouth and insulted his team mates and coaches he may have had a chance to go to worlds again.

hm71mqt,Reclaimer879,11/26/2021,1,74.0,I have seen the Faker vs Chovy match up enough to realize Faker brings more to his teams. Chovy is a beast in lane but that isnt the full package. I would take Showmaker over Chovy anyday and depending on the type of roster I would take Faker as well. BDD imo looked better this Worlds.
hm8dshn,castrozaka,11/26/2021,1,3.0,League of Legends the MOBA is dying and not actively drawing in new players. At least in long-term anyway. The community is fucking evil at its core the gameplay and balance are becoming shittier with each passing season the game is very difficult and overwhelmingly newcomer unfriendly. And this isnt even scratching at the surface of its problems now.  On the other hand League of Legends as a multi-media IP is going strong and will carry on. You have a plethora of engaging spinoff games a compelling cartoon and comic cinematic universe and so on. An ambitious fighting game as Riots next E-Sports IP can also create a community to eclipse the MOBA by drawing in the FGC.  It seems they planned well ahead anticipating for what might happen to the MOBA.
hm8jqtw,LazerFruit,11/26/2021,1,10.0,I dont think the issue is one of physically declining tbh the issue is one of time. What sport requires its athletes to practice 10-12 hours a day if not more to maintain top level. I think the reason pro players get worse faster in league than traditional sports is because they lose the drive to spend their entire day every day playing and practicing league. When you get older you prioritize other things some people want to spend time with family/significant others start families etc. So they spend less and less time practicing so other players improve faster while they fall behind the curve
hm8bs8h,zoewarner,11/26/2021,1,166.0,Well presented in both text and the accompanying video.  Hope it gets the attention it needs.  These are the types of posts that should grab attention instead of just Talon is fuckin buggy Rito - PLeaZe FiX!

hm7kj3s,setocsheir,11/26/2021,1,130.0,You need to acheive the next step of awareness which is knowing what you can do with that information.  So you know theres 3 bot side. That means you can take an objective topside. At its most basic. So thats like gold level knowledge.  Once you get more advanced itll be like I spotted Lee Sin bot side with idk 45 cs or something. We have vision in his jungle bot side and know he just cleared bot side with his top side camps up. Lee sin will probably try to gank mid or bot or take dragon - if those arent options he will path around top and look to clear his camps top. That means you can let your top laner know where Lee Sin will likely be or plan to take dragon with your jungler with the prio you have bot. It could also be I know lee sin will be top side so I can play more aggressively and take plates bot as a result.  You have to start applying the knowledge you do have to situations further in the future and go beyond basic ok am I going to get ganked here or not?

hm76w0u,babylovesbaby,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Its not the same situation. Day jobs and once in a life time events you pin your hopes and dreams and future career prospects on are not the same thing. Most people have to be explicit about issues which take them away from work but again day job vs. the aforementioned is hugely different. I dont think the teammates had a right to know the details but their frustration is understandable.  I just wish threads like this would stop being posted - everyone seems to understand the situation was bad and this aftermath is unnecessary.
hm7z8oc,DangerousSeaweed0,11/26/2021,1,1589.0,if people really thought upset might leave  bean wouldnt have had only 2 10 minutes scrim games.  if there is even a small chance one of your players cant play  u try to integrate the substitute into scrims.  remember mikyx at msi 2019 ? g2 mostly scrimmed with promisque because miky had hand issues and the org was not certain he could play.   fnc not giving bean more then 2 scrims when that possibility was on the table means 1 of 2 things :  - fncs coaching staff is incompetent.  - fnc expected upset to play.  Assuming yamato is not a straight up idiot  that means that upset didnt made the issue as clear as he makes it be at the very least

hm7t7cl,LakersLAQ,11/26/2021,1,161.0,What is his buyout at? No one with credible information has said that this is the case lol.  All the top teams had different plans and Jensen is not going to cut his salary just so he can play on a worse roster. It would be smart for him to just take a break and collect his salary for at least a split or the year then he can make a choice after. Crazy to think that Steve is holding Jensen in contract jail just so TL can keep paying his salary.
hm801rw,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,55.0,Champion pool definitely has a HUGE part in climbing. Sitting on a small pool will help you climb much faster. Having versatility in champion playstyle is essential when it comes to learning role + climbing. Ex. Playing ADC my champ pool would be something like  Hyper carry Utility Duelist (Jinx Jhin Kalista). At first I would play on rovex3 and just play kayn for fun. I wasted a LOT of time on that but it was fun  l o0 o l. Next season for sure I will take the climb very seriously and treat every account as my main so I can climb higher.

hm7dt3j,Lahwtiste,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,He literally says he shared some deatils with me.   Yamato knew the gist of it but he didnt need to know all the details to understand how bad it was. The same way it was explained that Hyli didnt want to know any details because what he already knew was enough to understand how important it was.
hm7u1tp,evan1932,11/26/2021,1,124.0,This sub is a joke. 80% of the posts are esports related when a whole sub dedicated to lol esports exists. And a lot of these posts are just updates on drama between players/organizations. I get that this is a general subreddit for lol and lol-related stuff but the amount of attention and arguments around this stupid and pointless drama is insane to me and not a good look for the sub especially to newcomers and new players.

hm8lfv1,Eaglekingoftheskies,11/26/2021,1,12350.0,> What other weapons have we seen enforcers use throughout the series? Its literally just rifles and at best case gas grenades. Of the two people with hextech one is also missing. >  >   The weridest thing about this argument is that you assume they arent going to make more hextech weapons when they litearlly talk about arming enforcers with hextech. You keep saying some nonsense like silco will just attack before that happens when he doesnt have any power at all to do so.   >Yeah and those that actually did this are a minority. Most people dont want to risk dying.   You really dont understand much about history   >Youre the one who said they were calling for their precious earlier lmao they crawl on all fours and go precious when silco pulls out a vial. They literally all golum.    I never said any of that. You kept acting like they were compeltely and totaly useless. Its a stupid argument now and its stupid everytime youve mentioned it  >Ah yes me thinking the drug trade is about money is wrong lmao   Not the money thing. You thinking the drug trade is all about funding the revoluton is wrong and you still have yet to address the fact that silco just commited straight up murder. The closest was you saying people die in war which had nothing to do with silco murering people.   >Ok hold on how was Vander fixing zaun exactly? He cut a deal with the enforcers to try and maintain the status quo. He wasnt actually improving anything.   Where on earth did you get the idea vander was trying to maintain the status quo from? That is literally never even implied. You have some sort of werid selective memory because several points youve made this entire conversation is just you literally misremembering a scene.   >How can you possibly think that bribing enforcers doesnt help his goal of a revolution?  Because he forced the enforcers to brutally murder people on the streets. Seriously rewatch the series. Theyve mentioned tthis several times. It had nothing to do with them trying to stop them. It was never about controlling an enemy force. It was always about installing fear in the population of zaun so that theyd never rebel against him. One of the main reasons why he tried so hard to get rid of the firelights is because they did actually stand up to silco.  Whats werid about you aside form you misremembering scenes is that the show is pretty clear on the narrative about this. Its not my intperation. Silco was manipulating athority and doing whatever it took to stay in power why ekko and his groups were vigilantes who tried to stand up to him. You just keep trying to whitewash everything silco does and try to link it all to a revolution that never happened.   >The deal he cut with jayce is literally him stating it.   No he didnt. Because like I said earlier you completely misremmebered the scene. Silco never intimitaded jayce into do anything and there is no indication that he was ever using the drug trade to fund research. In fact his actual factory where he made the stuff is run mostly by children. Jayce cut a deal with silco out of sympathy and nothing more. Jayce said that silco would get crushed if they went against piltover and wanted to avoid more bloodshed. He also said that Piltover has ignored most of zauns problems so is unworthy to be in charge of the place. Those are the two reasons why Jayce cut a deal. It had litearlly nothing to do with anything silco did   >No the issue is that you seem to think that revolutionaries/revolutions/civil war leaders are hollier than jesus figures that are completely infallible and 100% pure of heart that never did anything bad.   I literally never said or implied any of the sort. But silco never started a revolution. You can say he tried to plan one sure but not everything the character did was related to that goal. You seem to think that silco murdering children somehow helped him with a revoliution. And then you kept trying to make a bunch of straw men arguments like when you brought up death tol  Like I said in another comments the amount of civilians involved the death toll  the cause the date none of that stuff is relevant or similar to anything silco did. Because silco never started a revoluton. Silco was a drug kingpin who commited murder in order to stay in power and bribed the cops to take out rivals and those who stood up to him

hm7bx0t,TheAatroxMain,11/26/2021,1,102.0,Not at all with tanks  and rarely to the same degree unless youre Darius . Few have the aoe and lifesteal of an aatrox and fewer steal the range and movement speed to abuse it to that extent.

hm7ary8,Newfypuppie,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,Worlds is literally the biggest tournament of theses players career. Upsets decision impacts not only himself but also his teammates.  Ultimately they deserve to know and the fact that upset isnt even willing to talk to adam in private about these issues shows to me that hes lying.
hm72wrw,Hykarus,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Well personally I believe Upset is a selfish and immature man (so you know where I stand) but I agree its disappointing that people would go insult him under his twits or in MPs.

hm7c5jn,Btigeriz,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,Do you really think that Fnatic management didnt take Upset having to leave worlds into account when thinking about roster changes? X to doubt Adam is only being replaced because of worlds performance his twitlonger is proof enough that he lacks quite a bit of maturity.
hm7hvqi,Lemmiwinkz,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,You are missing an important factor here telling the whole team would be essentially the same as telling the public people talk. Had the whole team gotten more details these details would be on twitter within weeks probably. He has known Adam for 5-ish months most people would probably not want to share intimate details of a family tradegy with someone youve known for 5 months

hm7guaw,hanameister,11/26/2021,1,75.0,1. Your trinket should always be blue or yellow (most eves players prefer blue) because if you sweep with oracle the enemy can see that the vision is temporarily gone 2. predator seems like a gimmick (you might hit w easier but youre letting them know that youre there with predator giving counterplay) best way to hit charm is be behind them cast charm and let them walk into you or quick w q and burst if you know you can kill 3. your cs per min indicates youre not keeping up in cs the enemy jungler (6-7 cs per min is ideal) 4. your itemization doesnt look ideal besides having mejai and protobelt but you die way too much (6 is way too high for an eve player to keep the stacks) try: dark seal/mejais into protobelt/boots and after is situational deathcap if youre snowballing or ahead into banshees/lich bane as last items. Zhonya is not good on eve. Void staff can be bought imo but some dont like it because eve has great magic pen with W and general burst.

hm8ofbf,sephrinx,11/26/2021,1,165.0,Funny how everyone always says just play support and youll climb.  Maybe theyre referring to lower elos.
hm6y8f5,PassageForsaken8736,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Tell me you don’t understand how competitive league is not the same as soloq without telling me:   There’s a reason concepts like weakside/strongside feeding resources etc exist in competitive sports and it’s very difficult to play with a different team composition where you have no chemistry all of a sudden. Not commenting at all on Adam/Upset but Nisqy played very well when he was able to and this is not on him at all.
hm7yryi,could_eat,11/26/2021,1,13.0,What makes an adc strong in lane? It can be that they have a long auto range strong poke strong all in strong trades CC etc.  You typically pick a support that can enhance their strengths or in some cases make up for their weakness. For example: engage supports with all in adcs enchanter supports with dps champions like kogmaw poke adc and support.  So long as you stick to a reasonably small champ pool you will learn through experience. There arent that many adc champions so youll learn pretty quickly how they play.

hm7xlme,byeolToT,11/26/2021,1,156.0,Your friend probably dosnt care and dosnt want to improve but wants to just be good at the game but that only works for a small amount of players. Most of us normal people have to put in a lot of time in improving and getting small edges above the people on out elo. Also mindset says a lot and i think if someone is Stuck in Bronze but plays that amount of games they probably think they know everything but they dont know anything at All. Its also kinda important to Focus on one role and a small amount of Champions (2-3).
hm7jwpm,TargonBoi,11/26/2021,1,205.0,Are you aware that merging servers would also merge the infrastructure? Meaning that EUW would benefit from games hoster in Germany and to the east of it on the former EUNE while still being EUW?
hm7xwje,JevonP,11/26/2021,1,,no some people just dont understand how to apply perfect practice perfectly over time  everyone has the capacity to improve. Its all a mental thing you arent born good or bad at anything besides very small outliers who have mechanical or mental advantages.  The vast majority of players in any game/sport can improve. You arent just consigned to being shit
hm7uov4,SamsungBaker,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,You still dont get the point probably lack of education.   Yes Alphari is better than Adam but its not a REASON to backstab your teammate like this even more when you didnt even play at Worlds and literally made your team mental boom.   Like Upset move made all of FNC played poor at Worlds and so he decide to replace them because they played poorly + all behind their back you cant be more trashy than this
hm7dfw0,Dangnoob,11/26/2021,1,72.0,I also used Eve to hit plat this past season. And Im a jinx main at heart LOL. She can just snowball so hard and control the game. Good job man.
hm7pl75,SamsungBaker,11/26/2021,1,,Arent good?   Nisqy literally hard carried FNC during playoff as for Adam he was one of the best toplaner in LEC.   They had poor performance because all of FNC went mental boom because of Upset leave and obviously the one who didnt play worlds want to replace both of them wow
hm8kfjx,Rodniconii,11/26/2021,1,4.0,If you want a real ruined King story just play the game. Its so much better.

hm7lbgy,Spitfire836,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,It sounds like that’s not even what he said to the team (Upset said this but Adam said otherwise and Bwipo and Nisqy also being really upset leans towards the fact that they weren’t told that either)
hm76i18,Odd_Play_5769,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,So upset posted a childish twitlonger in response to Adams childish Twitlonger realized it was childish after and then got FNATCs PR firm to writehim a better one (if you have any experience working with PR at a large corporation you know PR formatting and font the second you see it). Do I have all that right? Yeah Adam was the douchebag thoughnot Upset even though Upset did the same thing but Upset has the moral highground because he can hide behind family emergency and privacy in a highly public profession.. am I understanding all this correctly?? This is unironically your stance?

hm74737,00Dandy,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,Well Upset is better than Rekkles atm so Fnatic couldve tried to trade him. Besides that there were plenty of other good ADCs available this offseason like Hans Sama Carzzy Patrik and several others. Or they could have promoted Bean to the main roster.

Do that mean they deserve to know private things about people they dont know to release their frustration ? I dont think so.  Even worse it would lead to leak those private informations to thousands of people. You keep thinking about Upset. Think about his wife or whoever is involved in that situation. Is it fair for her that thousands of people with definitely a part of malicious ones know about her miscarriage / suicide / cancer / whatever happened to her ?  &#x200B  Its not Adam Nisqy or Bwipos call to allow that to be leaked. Hell its not even Upsets call. Its hers. And no way she would accept that.  &#x200B  As much frustrated they are by not knowing why their world turned to shit its not an information they should know.  And that attempt to turn the blame on Upsets wife is a real asshole move whatever how young Adam is. And i really hope he gets some kind of retribution for actively trying to send people to harass a woman who were probably already living a frickin nightmare.

hm7knbj,00petar00,11/26/2021,1,130.0,He probably isnt trying to improve i was like him when i started playing and for the first 2 years i only played normal games and i didnt even play that often.  Many people are saying that the problem is that he is raging and blaming other people thats not really the case why do you think challanger streamers can do that every single game and still be challanger it comes to the mentality and if you can accept that you too make mistakes you can blame your team in your head for some plays but theres really not much value in typing it unless you want to lose.  It mostly came down to me playing on autopilot and just locking in the champion i want to play doing the same thing every game once you realize that you are doing that you can start to improve.  Willingness to improve not just spam games thinking you will get better that just loops you into auto-pilot gameplay ive been talking about. Always think about your decisions watch replays and figure out what you did wrong in a game and not just repeating the same mistakes.  Playing one champion or one tricking will be very helpful thats how i reached diamond for the first time once you play one champion enough that you can tell what any other champion in the game can do to you (how much damage/how much utility they provide) and knowing how much you can take damage and who you can survive and kill every single time. Thats why it is important to play one champion or a few at most when you are playing seriously you learn the limits of your champion.  If you are a laner you should learn to cs without focusing too much on last hitting so you can focus on map and enemy champion/jungler pathing/warding.  I can go on and on about specific skills and knowledge that is important like map awareness last hitting minions jungle pathing for your and enemy jungler but overall you can figure this by yourself or look it up on youtube what mostly matters is mentality of the player that wants to improve there are people with millions of points on a champion stuck in bronze and most of them arent trying to improve not everyone can though but most people can reach gold/plat and even diamond even without any great mechanical play and reaction time required by just using your knowledge.
hm7xun7,Interesting-Ad8898,11/26/2021,1,13.0,This actually happens in ARAM quite frequently. I have like 1500 aram games (which to some might not be a lot…but that’s a lot of games IMO) and I very rarely encounter toxic people. A lot of the time it’s positive interactions even with the other team. Just today a teammate said we need for healing reduction and literally next reset there was two morellos….

hm7kamq,LakersLAQ,11/26/2021,1,63.0,Did Bwipo still have a contract with Fnatic? If not hes not really a big change. His salary would just fall somewhere around what Alphari and Impact were making. Bjergsen wasnt a buyout because he was a free agent just salary at this point.  Hans Sama was the expensive one.   Same with Inspired on EG.
hm7sg4f,CoalaRebelde,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Management got value out of Adam and Bwipo almost got from Nisqy too.  Now they just give upset a shot at redemption with the org nurture his feeling of I need to make up and then sell him too when he peaks.  If they tried selling him now he would go for very cheap and every serious org would see a red flag in why does FNC wants to get rid of one of the best adcs in the league?.

hm77drf,RemoteAnalysis3809,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Imagine your own wife having a miscarriage (most likely since the timeline matches perfectly with a first/second trimester miscarriage considering how fast they got married and how few months it was before the incident took place)/get into an accident/etc. and your coworkers/fans be telling you shes just causing trouble.  No wonder Upset kept his mouth shut.
hm7n66o,Skylam,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Or it could be that both Adam and Bwipo are being unreasonable and wanted details other than family issues.
hm8l3kl,doglop,11/26/2021,1,17.0,Again like I said they CAN use it as bruisers CAN use thornmail its not as effective as if they were for the role they were made the same as ap items most adcs dont have good ap scaling and rely on basuc attacks
hm7bmw6,mistood,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,I want to give you some context on Upsets mentality.        Upset meets a camgirl/onlyfans girls who lives in South America online dates her for 2 months and decides to marry her. This is her 3rd marriage and she even has hundreds of nudes available online. You can tell from her social media that she has many red flags.        Upset makes the judgement to commit to this kind of woman marrying her after only 2 months of dating. You think he is someone who makes smart and sensible decisions? Lets just say he is prone to making stupid decisions at times. I hate how he keeps saying that the reason is due to family suffering as if his mom/dad is dying but its really he has some issues with his manipulative psychotic wife.        The fact that he chose to leave 12 hours before the first game suddenly makes me believe that the camgirl wife gave some sort of ultimatum. I do believe there is some truth in Adams statement of her feeling lonely. From her bio you can tell after they married she moved to Germany away from her home in South America. She is probably not adjusting well with no friends and family except Upset. The ultimatum was probably something like  I want to go back home to South America if you dont come back then I will leave. If his wife was truly sick it doesnt make sense that he would sudenly leave 12 hours before the game. The timing doesnt make sense. He knew he had to choose his wife or league and he chose league. The real reason would give him so much criticism that I believe he chose to put it under the guise of muh privacy. If he had a real reason people would understand support and respect his decision to leave.

hm74v14,Burning87,11/26/2021,1,108.0,Habit and stagnation can become far more of an enemy than even trollers feeders and smurfs ever could be. You see this absolutely all over the place. I am not embarrassed to admit I would easily fit into this myself as well. I reached Platinum within my third year of playing  (which is technically also a slow burn I think most would make it in their second year if they played to grow.. if not first) and I have been there since. The only excuse I have is that I genuinely feel my champions have never been granted the honor of ever being meta but they have never been NOT meta either. Just somewhere in between. There have been plenty examples of people making it where I have not.      I have a minor excuse of quitting the game somewhat in season 7 8 and partly through season 9. But I think I should have managed Diamond by now. My own experience is simply that unless you accept that you have flaws and that your choices might not be the correct ones you will never grow and get out of your bubble. Especially so if youre stuck in even lower tiers than Silver. It can be a hellish landscape unless you push your skill higher. You cannot rely on your team in such places which means you have to be the win factor every time.
hm7c7re,pinkspott,11/26/2021,1,7.0,Some abilities do seem standardized though. Projectile-type abilities that come out as a champion dies always seem to do damage (e.g. Veigar Q or Bard Q).

You dont have to trust everyone until they prove you wrong i bet someone that would life his live like that is up to a lot of nasty suprises.  Trust is earned. Hyli was able to earn his share Adam and Bwipo werent.  Why should they trust he had legit reasons? They dont have to. They have to accept it and not incite angry fans to harass him and his wife.   They have the right to be angry and irretated i can empathise with that. But shit happens.

hm78l46,puhtoinen,11/26/2021,1,141.0,How is that racist? When youve played CS:GO for 4000 hours while neighboring Russia you can get back to me with your own anecdotal evidence.  I never said russians are incapable of speaking english or learning the language. I merely pointed out a fact that the vast majority of russians I encountered in the couple thousand games I played would only communicate in russian even in situations where the rest of the team were speaking english with eachother.  This is also not something only I have witnessed go ask the Dota2 community how hard it is to communicate with russians.   I also dont understand how you managed to get offended people like to be able to communicate with their teams in team games. When that doesnt happen no matter what the reason is it takes something out of the experience. I have no ill will towards the people of Russia I just cant communicate with them and that does bum me out in a game thats all about the team.
hm75xzx,InsuranceOne2864,11/26/2021,1,1001.0, Im still defending upset but you are totally right. Everything about their relationship looks weird from his wifes background (2 divorcesneeding visa for europeonly fansgold digger status) to the fact that they married so fucking soon as they got together.    Its absolutely unreal how young adult males are so easy target for manipulative women. Even worse when someone like Upset has probably 0 life experience in social interactions.   The guy married mostly based on his hormones and he does not even realize it.
hm76f1w,InsuranceOne2864,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Nah its much more.   2 divorces getting visa for europe from a south american country onlyfans/some sex cam too i think gold digger status in chile and a couple of more people saying she was a prostitute too (i have 0 proof in this regard so i wont take it into consideration).   Poor guy married after his hormones went nuts and he does not even realize it yet.

hm7pfh9,vegeful,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Its even more shitty when he got caught playing aram during Fnc match. According to some its a 10 hour long of playing league.    Like dude have some consideration and play on alt account or offline game. Its give many kind of speculation and bring mixed feeling to your team mate. It give the i gtg soon to your bff but 10 minute later u play with another friend vibes.  He truly dont give a fk about his team feeling.
hm76jb1,whydoyoureadnames,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Given the scenario and events surrounding it they were most likely given enough info that something involving his wife happened (Adam mentioning the wife bwipo and girlfriend tweets at the time etc.)  So we can infer that meaning they got info enough to know it involves the wife in someway most likely. So they got told something and that’s all they need to know honestly. If a personal emergency happens than that’s the end of discussion they aren’t entitled to know more and sure as hell shouldn’t direct fans to harass people either.  Edit: done explaining this to people who want to just be angry that an adult had an emergency and dealt with it fine

hm89fe9,MapPotential9009,11/26/2021,1,65.0,League isnt about having fun anymore its about winning at all costs even in non-ranked/urf/ultimate spellbook games. It used to be a slower paced game with less power spikes and more winnable comebacks but todays League is a different beast. A single kill or item can put certain characters so far ahead of their opponent that it becomes almost impossible to comeback. Games now snowball so hard 50% of the time League is really unfun to play. The community has also become far less forgiving and patient to mistakes and the blame is always shifted to another player even though the mistake was their fault. Toxicity is a real problem at the moment and it goes unchecked and unpunished which really sucks for veteran and new players. Riot have failed to address it.

hm7l9dg,SolaSenpai,11/26/2021,1,13.0,to be fair it depends on their champ alot if Im playing ap koggy and you start a slowpush in my lane Ill be turbo upset and sit by tower but if Im ezreal or kassadin it really doesnt matter
hm7mwjc,Def1ance,11/26/2021,1,80.0,We dont care either.
hm74eoz,matteosagwa,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,Adam literaly said he was speculating about Upsets reason being not a big deal which is incredibly irresponsible thing to do seeing how all his fans are taking it as fact when he himself admitted he was speculating.

hm84zkm,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,92.0,My ADC on my collegiate team is from EUW and I think he could vouch to say Im better than Diamond EUW players. But again I dont think that matters. The people who comment think I can help them and if someone in Diamond EUW asks me for help then all to them I can answer their questions. If they think theyre better than NA challenger then so be it.
hm8077f,cygodx,11/26/2021,1,88.0,JDG wink honestly best offseason move
hm7m9z9,aglimmerof,11/26/2021,1,540.0,Akalis shroud was supposed to give true invisibility protecting her from even turret aggro.  Thankfully it didnt make it into the game ...
hm78xqn,Melodias07,11/26/2021,1,74.0,Look at replies of my other comment literally just following narrative. Even CL said that Faker had really solid form in QF and chovy said that Faker made 0 mistakes in lane so he couldnt do anything (paraphrased) but here people are living in there delusion.  chovy was below average in early summer and at the end was just just okay. In playoffs it was more about Deft/Vsta diffing every botlane they met but yeah DeFt WaShEd and its always has been ChoVy LiFeEsPoRt.
hm74brq,TricKyBoy,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,French Canadians live in NA too you know.
hm80ynn,RektByDefault,11/26/2021,1,11.0,Sometimes I type fullmute all and then oops forgot the slash in the chat. It usually stops the flame but then I can still hear them if they actually say something smart.
hm76u0o,CoCratzY,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Yeah I thought the same when I saw the video. It Seems like no one knows even Dardo or Yamato and now they have to lie to protect Upset argumentation
hm78t7j,Caenen_,11/26/2021,1,2.0,Its specific to how the spell is implemented unfortunately. Generally anything that uses a cast time or channel and does its effects after it does not do its effects if you die during the cast time. This is why Xerath W works this way even though spells that feel very similar do.   Xerath Q on the other hand creates the line with the area checks immediately when you recast then the effect triggers after a brief delay. Whether thats a bug is up to Riot tom decide but as per usual its thats how it works presently for the most part.  Obviously missiles that are already spawned (e.g. Xerath E after his cast time completed) persist even if their caster dies. Most of them at least.  Heres a fun note since you mentioned Sivir Q though: Early Boomerang spells didnt properly work when their caster died because casting the return missile would run into some issue (I dont remember atm if it was that it couldnt cast at a dead target or a dead character couldnt cast them) so instead of fixing that innate spell behaviour on those spells they just made a separate spell for the return missile for Sivir Q and Ahri Q and I dont remember if anyone else. Either way this is the reason Ahri Q has had her Q go invisible on the return when she died after VFX updates at least twice lmao.
hm8okzm,sephrinx,11/26/2021,1,165.0,Did you ever employ the use of the /muteall strategy?
hm77c7f,jaguar317,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Im confused by why you are equating Upset and Adams statements. Adam was very clearly on the offensive while Upset has been defending himself. Yes one is a douchebag because he directed massive amounts of hate from people like you towards Upset. The other is being bombarded by hate comments everywhere and is trying to defend himself. Yeah I feel like these two things are very different.
hm7ci94,seink,11/26/2021,1,69.0,> Lets say Riot decided to change Yasuo/Yones Ronin like outfit into something from a Chinese dynasty in major Riot label. Wouldnt fucking make sense right?   So what if it doesnt make sense? I have never thought any more or less about Yasuo and japan because its all fictional.   >Also imagine Wukong with a Samurai armor instead of a Chinese like garb from the journey to the West. Chinese people will 100% have problems with this.  I am chinese and I dont give a shit about whether wukong is not chinese enough because I have better things to do.    >  Hell some Europeans got mad that Caitlyn was turned half-Asian in Arcane when she is supposed to be a Caucasian- British aristocrat. Let me reiterate that I know its fucking fictional and a game but these things matter to some not all people.  Yeah you and those people with caitlyn mentality are ridiculous. If you dont like dont play the game. Nobody is forcing you down the throat or making assumptions about korea because of ahri.  > Ahri was created when the Korean server came out with a distinct Korean cultural semblance and even a Korean name. It is representative of Korean culture even though you might not think that way.  Yeah and I know that. And anyone with half a brain knows that she is not representative of what korean culture really is because its a fictional character in a game.   > if mad dont play the game hurdurr are you 12 who cant manage any discussion/discourse?  Well let see. If a imaginary character triggers someones cultural sensitivity and they feel the need to spend time to whine about it on the internet then yes they should uninstall and do something else.  Ahri being more or less correctly portrait in korean culture has nothing to do with korean or implies anything about them because she not real. If you cant accept that then the ONLY sensible discourse is to stop looking at it.

No - you wouldnt

hm7nn68,akutasame94,11/26/2021,1,,Because you cannot tell me that so many French people dont speak English. Ive seen numerous languages used in games and they always used English no matter how bad to communicate the plays or answer. Only French and Polish players absolutely refuse to use English and I doubt so many of them dont speak it.   Even Russians in CSGO who just blurt Russian in pubs will answer something in English even if its just to tell you Fuck you

hm765rj,Thomean,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,They have the right to be angry but they do not have the right to know the exact situation. That is something for Upset and his family to decide.   There is also a very big difference between saying the way worlds went sucked which made you angry and saying he just went home because his gf was lonely.   Him not telling them is not disrespectfull at all. And as far as my experience goes in pro sports (development teams in my youth) it was not the norm to share personal information during family problems.   Hell I would not even expect my own family to share everything about a problem if they did not want to talk about it. They will tell me enough and I trust them. And comming back to sports if the manager/coach said it was an emergency then it was an emergency.   This just sounds like Adam not trusting anyone at fnatic
hm78e2f,dmtoddle,11/26/2021,1,1190.0,Yeah Im js this bc hes still listed as looking for a team on this sheet
hm79qw2,Btigeriz,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,100% Adam and anybody else on the team are allowed to be upset but Adam knew what was going to happen when he publicly said Upsets reason wasnt legitimate and had to do with his wife (he was likely completely wrong) and that is why Adam should get criticized by the community. Even if he just wanted to call Upset out fine whatever but leave Upsets family out of it.

hm76wcv,Lothric43,11/26/2021,1,23.0,Well account for taste the bulk of what I listen to is metal but for a comparable pop example I thought Carly Rae Jepsen’s Emotion was full of great songs and a consistent style.  I mean Bob Dylan didn’t have a career off just some big singles he had albums that people loved most or all of. A number of them even.
hm88svu,AshesOntheFire778,11/26/2021,1,51.0,So zed can just target nasus adc instead. Its not a doomed game
hm7befp,SuperShant,11/26/2021,1,6.0,The problem is I like to play games and watch myself improve that is what keeps me playing. When I play other games like CS Valorant Tarkov I may lose and die but I feel myself improving and making fewer mistakes. In the league I dont feel that way at all it just feels like a massive waste of time. And that is not saying that Im good at the league rather Im pretty horseshit but I dont get the sense that Im improving.
hm7iwp3,NinjaMayCry,11/26/2021,1,150.0,I remember being new in S4 and spectating incarnati0n via the clients feature. His Syndra and Fizz were great. Always wondered who that #1 beast was
hm7ewmb,Dec111819,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,Add to that the pEople are InSanE to ask him to reveal it!.  No. Nobodys asking Upset to reveal it to the public I have no idea why this is even a talking point.   What people *are* saying is that Upset leaving and giving an excuse that a majority (3/5) of the team feels is totally inadequate is the problem.
hm6zjsi,JealotGaming,11/26/2021,1,141.0,I really want the merger cause my friends play on EUW but most people I know play on EUNE and i really do not have the patience to have two different accounts for this...  Also because the malding that high elo players from EUW would do because of having to play with EUNE high elo
hm73u90,Drathmar,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,And people bashing him are trash. He doesnt need to share shit other than it was a serious family situation to anyone other than who he already did.   If a fan bashes him or especially his wife over that they are a piece of shit. Full stop. Just like Adam is for bringing her into it.   Also the removing teammates thing is bullshit Adam fans are reaching for to be pissed when he gave his opinion to managment which was already looking to replace the weakest player and a mediorce middle of the pack toplaner with someone better. Its esports that shit happens all the time and he sounded like a petulant child complaining about it.

hm84mqj,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,92.0,Lets say youre playing lulu. Enemy ad has to farm and you can harass them while theyre farming. You can auto space enemy support and auto harass them. Harassing and letting your ad farm safely will always maximize your lead from botlane.
hm8ngu0,7StarsYoutubeMe,11/26/2021,1,175.0,I disagree with peoples advice that you can’t get get better while blaming team members. That shit happens in challenger daily. The real issues are probably 3 things. Mechanics macro and micro. Mental is overrated af by this sub (although I do think it help) if you’re good at mechanics and micro play with decent macro then you’re hitting diamond easily. He’s probably a shit tier farmer who plays 30+ champs a season dies 8+ a game and doesn’t play for objectives if he does get fed. Probably poor itemization too. I use to coach a lot and these were the biggest problems
hm8musa,Robotron_Sage,11/26/2021,1,10.0,I think Jinx through her guilt will reconstruct her former friends.    Honestly thought Claggor was gonna become Blitzcrank even before he died.

hm7sspz,ShinaMashir0,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,I just find funny that now 75% of people on reddit are for some reason siding with Wunder even tho literally everyone shat on him last season (maybe even the last 2 season tbh)  Im personally a wudner fan and i always defended him but he could be either washed/decent or back to his peak again but chance are way slimer that he will be very good again
hm75ak5,BigBadDogLol,11/26/2021,1,3.0,Because this game was the “final straw” to your probably laundry list prior. It just shows the trigger game and “recents” for reflection purposes but they aren’t the sole cause for the punishment
hm8kkvt,Complex_Solution_643,11/26/2021,1,7.0,Seraphine is a mid laner Sona is a support. No way Riot is that dumb to make 2 support plant related girls. Same reason why Maokai and Ivern dont have the same main roles. Corina will be a laner or jungle not a support.

hm7x54x,NoobFade,11/26/2021,1,20.0,Active: Jax enters Evasion a defensive stance for 2 seconds causing all non turret basic attacks against him to be dodged. Jax also takes 25% reduced damage from all champion area of effect abilities. Counter Strike can be recast after 1 second.  At the end of the duration Jax Stun stuns all nearby enemies for 1 second and deals physical damage to them increased by 20% for each attack dodged up to a 100% increase.  This season Jaxs clearspeed in the jungle is lower because of the removal of machete and youll generally lose fights early game if you stick around after using E but past level 6 or so and sheen you can fight him easily. Also works pretty well into Udyr top because your E makes it hard for Udyr to kill you early and you outscale him pretty quickly.
hm76q4r,rudebrooke,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,So youre essentially agreeing with what Upset did however youre still mad at him for doing it because he chose to phrase the same response slightly differently... got it.
hm7wbfr,ilovefishs911,11/26/2021,1,10.0,Ok bud
hm8alus,shaidyn,11/26/2021,1,9.0,Pretty much yeah.  The system puts too much emphasis on your first 100 games. If I have a 60% win rate in my first 100 games in a season (or on an account) my rank will skyrocket. But after that it slows down dramatically.  If a player has a 60% win rate over 50 games at Bronze and then Silver and then Gold their rate of climbing should NOT be slowing down. If anything it should be accellerating.
hm7i4sl,whydoyoureadnames,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,No they won’t cause unfortunately a substantial group of this sub are just man children with no social competency.

hm7j641,TyroneWubbles,11/26/2021,1,,I imagine the lawsuit arguments were eventually grasping at straws considering it went on for 3 years.
hm7u29h,uncertainrandompal,11/26/2021,1,124.0,where you seen my assumptions?   it’s only facts:  -	upset said he needed immediate action to do  - played all day arams -	upset said he told yamato before leaving - yamato said he didn’t knew anything.   i better trust actions based on facts rather than damage control posts which doesn’t clarify anything and exactly what expected.
hm7koeq,namja23,11/26/2021,1,56.0,The music mixes extremely well with the scenes which causes strong emotions.  So with it being new people are excited just be happy for them dude.
hm7fqde,edgelordweeb_,11/26/2021,1,43.0,I dont think it was as bad for Jackey. He was at his best 2019 spring and 2020 spring and was still prob the best adc in the world in 2020 summer. TheShy fell off pretty fucking hard after 2019.
hm7b3qh,SnooChickens7571,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,What a bs he should be happy he is with fanatic in the first place and not be so arrogant. He also just begun his career.

hm76a9u,2poundWheel,11/26/2021,1,74.0,I genuinely dont believe Peanut deserved that award it was between him and Canyon and I having watched Nongshims games seemed to be more of the Gori show with Peanut being a supporting element.  Not to mention with the LCKs disgustingly bad jungle pool last split sure whatever he can be top3. But with T1 dissolving their junglers (Ellim/Cuzz moving to full-time spots on two teams) I doubt Peanut will be able to keep it up. If he does id be surprised if it isnt because now he has a godtier/Z tier midlaner (up from Gori being an S/S+ tier mid)  Id rate Bo Ellim Oner Canyon above him and Croco even. Cuzz on a good year is better than him Dread is an absolute paycheck stealer and Umti/Willer arent worth talking about (Umti has no teammates and Willer has only played for Summer+Worlds being thrown into an unfair situation to step up or die he deserves more time)
hm6yhzp,DogAteMyCPU,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Ok dude you tell Upset to postpone his family emergency 2 weeks.
hm75q4h,Odd_Play_5769,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,I definitely think its one of those you listed that is assuming it is an actual medical emergency and they arent just saying its that for good PR. Who knows at this point
hm87h8y,Hikekomori0_O,11/26/2021,1,159.0,Can we talk about how viego can still pick up bard chimes after possessing and discarding since release
hm7malv,TheTipsyTurkeys,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,all of social media for sure
hm8rwoh,imjunsul,11/26/2021,1,27.0,Yea Dwg needs to do something... There are rumors about TheSHy going to LCK but I have a feeling its T1 or he stays with iG. DK should go after a few rookie/young players and hope 1 of them stands out or hope Nuguri comes back mid season.
hm7q6rh,GutsWay,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Not sure if you read my comment but I said he should specify what the emergency was. A personal emergency could literally be anything. I remember one time Crumbzz (the caster) was telling a story on the analyst desk of how this girl told him to come over and he told riot he had a family emergency so he couldnt cast. A personal emergency can literally mean anything. Stop justifying his actions.

hm73qi2,ASU_SexDevil,11/26/2021,1,22.0,Because if you sign a 3 year deal you’re going to get guaranteed income for the next 3 years. When players move teams the orgs have to buy out the rest of the contract with the player. If you sign 3 contracts in 3 splits you’re going to get 3 contracts worth of $$$ even if you only spend 1 split at a team the orgs have to pay up their end of the contract before it’s absolved and you can negotiate a new one... these aren’t transfer fees that clubs are pocketing
hm78hz4,lppur3ps3,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,I mean it seems like bwipo was more fucked up by the situation rather than the reasoning. I havent seen any evidence of bwipo being annoyed at how it happened. More just the situation itself. But no one is saying Adam shouldnt be annoyed or upset. Its about his response and views on it
hm7vxip,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,17.0,2 big ones Ive seen  Supports in under masters and even masters+  NOT DO (which is a big mistake)   Tank supports can impact the map heavily by themselves since they have CC. On resets they should be looking to roam while their ADC is safe.      Enchanter supports can very easily 1v2 lanes but play behind their AD when this is not how they are played.
hm87bl0,bed-sores,11/26/2021,1,92.0,i don’t get how the mechanics thing can be wholly applied to a role like that. top lane is full of mechanically brain dead champs and support has a lot of mages that also get played mid. unless we’re only counting last hitting which seems like a very narrow definition of mechanics.  seems more accurate to say certain categories of champs (enchanters as you said) are mechanically easier than to try and base it on roles that all have a variety of mechanical difficulty within them.  edit:also im relatively new to the game and not that good at it so im not saying you’re wrong just that i don’t really get it.
hm7az28,NvmSharkZ,11/26/2021,1,157.0,Im stealing that
hm7f5sa,OP_IzzoR,11/26/2021,1,,The problem is even fnatics management failed to explain shit properly. Since 3 players are completely clueless why he left. And yes believe it or not you can explain things without revealing details if you have at least 2 iq which i guess they didnt have.
hm8rvn2,The4thJames,11/26/2021,1,24.0,Yasuo yone and viego all have crit scaling so they benefit from building crit items and they are intentionally meant to build those items. Irelia builds bork first and then has a few options but shieldbow has a lot of what she wants out of an item (attack speed  AD  life steal tankyness from the sheild and passive stats). I imagine riot would like CCS built more but people may just not be catching on to it on the champs its good on. From what I see nasus players just tend to sit on the bramble cus they get what they want and it lets them rush more important items like frozen and spirit. If you dont benefit from finishing thornmail dont get it till 6 items and hope someone on your team gets anti heal.
hm79gep,PomegranateMaterial,11/26/2021,1,7.0,Yeah my bad mate. If it is like that then its a pretty smooth tease isnt it?

Oh and also hope they dont leak it to the 5 million people on this sub.   Adam himself said he dont give a f about Upsets privacy.   This sub thinks pros are supposed to be non humans who are willing to prioritize this game and your coworkers over everything else including the sanity health and privacy of your loved ones.  No wonder this community is widely considered the most toxic among pretty much all the games out there.

hm7gj95,Xyexs,11/26/2021,1,184.0,As a person from Sweden its always weird to me how everyone I know plays on euw. We are defaulted to eune and years ago I knew a few that still played there. But through the years they all gave in and at this point I dont know anyone still playing on our default server.
hm838n3,itsaworkalt,11/26/2021,1,,I blame Dardoch
hm71fce,Delphoxe,11/26/2021,1,4.0,There is a grace period that allows every player to load the game. I believe 4/5 minutes but once that time is up the game begins and then whoever is still loading will just enter the game late.
hm7fpj8,TemporaMoras,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,> insult Adam by saying hes moronic.  He is a child and he reacted like a child. idk what you would expect from a 19 year old who just learned that fnatic want to replace him because he actually doesnt realize he was probably the weakest part of the team for their run in the LEC (Not saying he is the weakest top laner just saying that the other 4 member where way above his skill leve)
hm7vc4o,Deolrin,11/26/2021,1,12336.0,Life is Strange: Before the Storm moment!
hm8dk96,Dwhizzle,11/26/2021,1,180.0,Thanks for making my point. Just because it’s not illegal doesn’t mean you aren’t an asshole.
hm77vn7,lolKhamul,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Is it that hard to understand guys that got a years worth of work sacrifice and commitment stolen from them and as the cherry on top they dont even know what or why?  Every FNC player or staffer has the right to blame Upset. If I were on FNC I would never ever want to play with Upset again. Reasons dont matter. It would just split the bases between people that think it was justified and people that dont. Its literally irrelevant what the reason was. The only thing it would give it maybe closure for the FNC players.  In the end it stays the same. Upset had a right to do what he did and he has the right to keep it private but every FNC staffer on the 2021 team has very much the right to blame him for ruining their year.   &#x200B  And if you cant see and at least understand Adam you are just lying to yourself. Because I would bet anything that you would be fucking furious if you committed a years worth of work (8-12 hours a day) towards a common goal with one or multiple partners and in the end one partner leaves you hanging destroying everything and doesnt even tell you why.
hm753ed,ccarrilo7,11/26/2021,1,49.0,Honestly its just the way the game goes shouldnt be this way but its what riot wants. Notice the people defending that a lux thats 3 levels down just one shot a fed adc its because of them that the state of the game is the way it is riot wants everyone to carry so now you can go a mage support and just try to one shot people because supports do get way too much gold for doing nothing its dumb.
hm70b6f,frenkli_h,11/26/2021,1,49.0,i know it was my missplay   i didnt post this  for people to judge what i did wrong and what i did right why are all these comments doing that XD  i didnt think lux was there since  earlier i saw like 2 members of her team at their blue and i thought she wouldve been there too thats why i walked like that

hm7t5cv,Poluact,11/26/2021,1,252.0,Ok look at your keyboard right now. Imagine you have to roll your face over keyboard and it should result in the word pandemic. The letters all over the keyboard and you have type them on the right on the left in the middle left right again... Its the same with женщины. And you do it once and get it from first hit. Because surely this guy didnt type it again and again and he also couldnt check if he got anything meaningful because he dont understand Cyrillic by his own words. 7 letters by the chance coincidentally. Yeah of course its accidental.  Theres actually much better explanation - he just copied it somewhere. The only confusing thing is his 1st word - where would he copy that. He didnt type it - why would he have Cyrillic layout installed if he doesnt understand it anyway.  Its honestly amusing its even a discussion.
hm7dufm,JamisonDouglas,11/26/2021,1,166.0,This just tells me you dont click the twitch links in pre/post game. Its always a Spanish guy. I explicitly click to see if they are Spanish now.
hm7g98z,akutasame94,11/26/2021,1,184.0,I transferred from EUNE to EUW was gold 1 on EUNE currently sitting in Silver 1 on EUW and wondering if I even wanna play further. The amount of games I lost due to toxicity or people running it down on EUW dwarfs those on EUNE with bonus points now I get flamed in languages I can understand (some more some less).  And no offense Frenchies but Id rather have Polish toxic players than French. French just go mdr as they die 15th time to turret Polish at least give up when they are ignored after few int deaths and sometimes try to win... Yet to see that with French inters (I mean some could have been of other nationalities but the ones that talked spoke in French)

hm8mk10,Banglatiger,11/26/2021,1,1.0,Wild rift makes playing certain champs look so much cooler. Like Camille fells so badass in Wild Rift and vayne W active sheesh. Also making chat more difficult removes toxicity who would have thought. Also it’s more vibrant.   Gold 4 League   Diamond 2 Wild Rift   I’m built different.

Huh... revealed 0 information wasnt hurtful to anyones privacy and conveyed that there was something severe that he needed to be available for.  If only hed told them it was a family emergency... ah wait he did. But apparently now family emergency can also mean something minor... lol.

hm7eg56,ChrisDrake,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,It sounds to me that he abruptly left after he said things took a turn from the worst . So I wouldnt be surprised if the last the team heard from upset was he was going through alot of personal issues  and then he was gone .

hm7jwlj,PsychoPass1,11/26/2021,1,63.0,Expensive buyouts -> Teams seem to always want to at least secure the player for a decently long time rather than paying the buyout and having them leave after one year (for free). At least C9 / TL can cash out on them if they want to leave again (of course that is only as long as teams are willing to pay such huge buyouts).

hm7d5go,Gorudu,11/26/2021,1,77.0,I kind of feel like the League stories need to remove plot armor from champions.

hm8bd5h,nitinismaldingXD,11/26/2021,1,29.0,https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Fear It’s almost like best rengar in NA hasn’t gone the rune in forever for a reason. You’re severely overestimating how much more useful it is over electrocute especially when considering that you already get attack speed from your q. If any of what you said is correct then we would be seeing HoB instead of electro.
hm8kuwp,aglimmerof,11/26/2021,1,140.0,What are your thoughts on the whole ‘X lane is Y diff’ mentality?   So for example last season it was something like:  Top is Jungle Diff  Jungle is Mid Diff  Bot is Supp diff  Do you think any of that is true or people just memeing?
hm7h84v,Gaarando,11/26/2021,1,144.0,He has literally called him bad many times with Nemesis. He also said this Worlds performance wasnt good even though anyone else thinks differently and he believes Jensen is not a good laner because of pro view.
hm6ywrl,Dreadedvegas,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Thats not even what the team was asking for he should have just told his teammates the situation.   The only reason this has blown up to the degree it has was because he told only the people he “trusts” leaving the rest of the team in the dark
hm7tx85,aegroti,11/26/2021,1,45.0,Oh damn that would be a great twist.  Victor in League isnt actually the victor from the show but is some kind of hextech clone amalgamation thing that was accidentally created and did the creation thinks its actually the creator type of thing killing the real Victor.  This is why hes almost cartoonishly evil at times and he wants to make other people like him.   Also why Jayce hates him so much hes putting his lost friends name into disrepute.

hm6ynsm,Personal-Expert3395,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,How is upset valuing his privacy is wrong but Adam stating a lie in twitlonger about the reason he left which lead to both of him and his wife to get  harassed is right? Like I understand you love Adam but use common sense. Also you should see Yamato response for those like you that says that the reason is something trivial and just an excuse.
hm8csi0,Cj_Checking,11/26/2021,1,111.0,Nice catch totally forgot about that
hm7cc20,sharaku17,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,Imagine this scenario. You are at work and you and your coworker have to design a presentation for your next big customer to convince them that they should take your company for the project.  You and your coworker work the entire year for that presentation. Than on the day of the presentation your coworkers doesn’t come to work and he has all the presentation slides. You don’t know anything about the reasons he is missing and you of course do a shit job at doing the presentation without the slides. No imagine that said coworker doesn’t explain anything to you after you have asked him why he ditched on you. And afterwards you find out that he even went to your boss and said „yo he isn’t up to my ambitions we should replace him“   Lmao in a working environment I would fuck this dude up it’s insane actually what kind of dick move this would be
hm7a36n,Kinomora,11/26/2021,1,635.0,Gold bounties are overtuned and are generally unfun to play around.   Not only  can you no longer snowball a good game into a win but a single lost team fight can also get the 1 already fed person on the enemy team full build in a matter of minutes catching their entire team up and then it goes from a +5000 gold difference to a -7500 gold difference.   Bounties are not fun.
hm7y8ud,byeolToT,11/26/2021,1,558.0,Some of those interactions Sound funny as Hell if they would Happen tbh. Would be kinda cool if riot would Release Videos or a game Mode for this Kind of Thing
hm7rxtm,snowflakepatrol99,11/26/2021,1,252.0,Not gonna lie I dont want to be in the shoes of the players that have to now endure EUNE players. The game was a shitshow before they split the servers. Everyone switched to EUW with the free transfer and if your friend started later then hed obviously join the server that you are in.  Theres absolutely no reason to play in EUNE other than a little less ping. Worse players more toxicity and overall way shittier server with no end goal. You only see shitty egotistical EUW players who cant reach challenger go there so that they feel better about themselves. No one unironically goes to EUNE to climb. If they ever try to merge them then you should be able to search games based on language just like in dota. Its the most annoying thing having russians french people and turkish people all flame each other in their own languages. Separating the 2 servers was the best thing to happen to EU.
hm7yxfz,GutsWay,11/26/2021,1,,Coming out swinging for no reason. You made a really disrespectful statement and it deservedly received a response with disrespect. Dont act surprised. You must not watch any other team sports. There are a handful of adult athletes who would react the exact same way as Adam did. His emotional response is completely justified. The only person without an adequate emotional understanding is Upset as he has been extremely selfish in regards to not telling his teammates why he left. The fact that Upset refused to tell his own teammates kinda proves that.
hm7nqqa,NocaNoha,11/26/2021,1,225.0,I know that Ravens have a pouch on the throat.. and that their vocalization is deeper than that of the crow      If you see them side by side irl you could probably judge them by the size but on a distance.. pff everything is a crow to me lol

hm70ywz,elikaweli,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Bro it is not up to you to decide that. Just shut up and let upset decide when he wants to tell the public about his family and when not. What you do is just pathetic.

hm85voo,Jiffyyy,11/26/2021,1,143.0,there is a perceived decent thing to do from both sides and one will lead to the other not happening.  for his teammates the decent thing to do is respect his wishes to remain private on the situation by his choice.  from Upset it would be to give clarity for what happened so his teammates can have closure.  at the end of the day its not up to the players on whether he talks about it its up to Upset.
hm865z6,OP_IzzoR,11/26/2021,1,39.0,so what is her basic attack? exactly. her Q simply switches between basic attack types lol. Vi was basic attacking a lot as well. Every regular punch is a basic attack.

hm74fz7,Odd_Play_5769,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,And no I mean after Adams Twitter log Upset should have said nothing and this blows over. Actually it is Upset not Adam who is keeping it going. Adam posted one Twitlonger on one day. Upset has posted essentially 2 over the course of 3 days. Seems to me that Upset cant let it go not Adam.

hm7eqau,Odd_Play_5769,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,Were dealing in abstract language so if we wanted to define teammate seriously we would need to go a whole Socrates discourse to define terms and what they mean and argue to prove our point. We wont go yhrough that but instead I will say:  Coworkers work together for a company.  Teams work for q company their work is practicing together in a highly coordinated function with the end goal of competition directly against other teams. This direcr competition against other teams adds an entirely new element to the coworker dynamic that makes it something deeper new and different.  Obviously Upset saw them as coworkers and not teammates. Thats fine. But actually at the heart of the drama in the community is this distinction of language between teammate and coworker.

hm7kw1f,Spitfire836,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,You lose some of your privacy when you’re a public figure it comes with the territory of being a (minor) celebrity.   And yes if me and a few other coworkers worked on a project/presentation for months and one of them publicly bailed 12 hours before we present at a conference I would 100% want to know why they bailed and I would expect the same attitudes towards me if I did the same.
hm8s1rn,Ecstatic_Wedding7040,11/26/2021,1,84.0,Nah people are just trying to make the narrative this way. But really it was just Vi hitting on Cait the whole time. Cait herself never had undeniable proof she liked Vi like that. But shippers will ship anyways

hm709dl,jinkiez,11/26/2021,1,57.0,This is such a bad game for new players or anyone looking to have fun. I use to recommend normals but that shit is toxic as fuck.

hm7g4aw,Elhak,11/26/2021,1,,There are plenty of things that I wouldnt want the rest of the world to hear about that are really serious and would still warrant going home especially anything that would hurt a family members reputation. Off the top of my head I can think of parents having a horribly messy divorce that you must be involved in a sibling being suicidal / unstable your wife has a stalker/ex who is actively making legitimate threats to her safety your partner having miscarriage... dont forget that if whoever is at the center of the reason he had to return home will get harassed endlessly by fans for being the reason the team failed.   Not every emergency is blameless and personally Id never want to subject someone I love to the wrath of thousands of people saying horrible things no matter what they did. I think people really need to have some empathy and also understand the consequences that come from making an actively difficult situation public.

hm7b04r,TheGawringSame,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,Thats still full bullshit.  How hard is it to say: A family member I was very close with had died or something. He didnt need to be specific. It would violate literally nobodys privacy when you dont mention any names dont mention genders or any sort of description as to who youre talking about.  You can even omit more details. You can say: someone I was close to passed away or was very sick. It would completely justify him leaving everybody would understand nobodys privacy would be violated. Nobody would have any fucking clue who he would be talking about and most people wouldnt care either. All theyd hear was that someone close had issues and he was a good person and went to support them. Acceptable.  Like holy shit Upset has to be the smallest brained individual on the god damn planet if he doesnt know how to communicate a serious situation without specifically mentioning someone that could be identified.   Its just crazy.

hm7zbch,Excalidorito,11/26/2021,1,277.0,Asian players (and eastern servers) usually have far more of a FF15 culture.  I think that’s a big reason why objective bounties were introduced to stop the FF15 culture just because enemy got FB/first scuttle/3 kill advantage.
hm7q84p,Craftingistheway,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,there is a very crucial info in that what?!  he claims he told them in the 2 weeks prior to his leaving there were problems in his personal life. Like this totaly contradicts the bullshit Adam tried to spin aka loney wife wants attention narrative. It means his depature while not planned isnt the 100% unforseeable stuff that would leave the team clueless. It literally says it had to be obvious to his teammate that him leaving means whatever situation he hinted at weeks earlier escalted.
hm81ake,DariusRivers,11/26/2021,1,150.0,If this is the case this raises a few more questions. The same items that are in the box Caitlyn is carrying are the same items that are in Vis bag that shes filling up with stolen items. Which would have meant those objects existed in two places simultaneously. And if Jayce went to his benefactors first then Ekko would have had the wrong location to give to Vi as a tip. He would have given them the Kirammans place not Jayces lab. Theres just a whole bunch that doesnt really add up and the rule of thumb is that if you have to make some sort of convoluted explanation to make plot points work then they didnt work.  Dont even get me started about Jayce and Mel haha. The development of his character from naive idealist to scummy politician to repentant realist would have been fine over the course of several seasons but definitely not over the course of 9 episodes and DEFINITELY not over the course of how short the in-universe length of time was in Act 2+3 from start to finish. And Mel went from someone who wanted Jayce and Viktor to build hextech weapons to being fervently for peace. I get that her tense relationship with her mother is supposed to have changed her opinions but it was definitely not handled well.  Again if you have to rely on your viewers to make convoluted explanations for plot points then you should have explained better. Caitlyn forging Jayces seal would have been a fairly important part of her whole scheme to talk to the inmates of Stillwater (remember she was there for the big goon first before the warden revealed hed been beaten up by Vi) so if that WAS the case the show should have shown it.
hm7gfqz,Vantablack9,11/26/2021,1,1192.0,Wrong thread but dont forget to have fun. After all it is a game. Sometimes people take it way too serious and ruin all the fun
hm7hlyk,-LostInCloud-,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,I surely could not. Kinda besides the point though the point being Adam just being an asshat.

hm6yi8h,sebitax321,11/26/2021,1,62.0,That makes sense Ill start using the meta stuff then thanks!
hm7vb40,Istvarrr,11/26/2021,1,3972.0,Again if it was a trivial matter why did FNC not punish his absence?? He is employed by the org are you telling me you really believe that FNC had no issue with Upset leaving worlds without a proper reason???  Now I am sure you are smart enough to answer „no“ to that question which then begs the question: If Upset told FNC why he left and they had no problem with him leaving why the fuck should Adam have a problem with it?
hm7smw3,DrLuciferZ,11/26/2021,1,110.0,HBO/Warner may own a lot of interesting IPs but for the most part when shows go viral it seems to be Netflix(Squid Game Arcane etc) and/or Disney(Wandavision Madalorian etc). All HBO has done is pissed off directors and actors on their hybrid release.

hm766ai,happygreenturtle,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Exactly. The problem I have with all of this is not that Upset didnt tell them what happened but that he apparently made no effort to help them understand on an emotional level where he was coming from. Its really cold to leave within a day of the most important tournament of the year and then not even speak to your team to repair the damage when you come back.  The way Adam writes this is as though Upset said Sorry I have to be with my girlfriend left and then upon coming back made no effort to reconcile with the teammates he abandoned (even if for good reason) and actually attempted to replace them behind their backs as soon as whatever drama was happening in his personal life was dealt with. That is.. kind of messed up and honestly fuck players like that. They always cause more trouble than theyre worth
hm7tgy6,Ok-Travel-7875,11/26/2021,1,161.0,The reason is going to come down to money at the end of the day. Last I remember he got an extension of 4.2m for 3 years. Who would want to pick up a $1m+ contract per year even if the buyout is $0 for a single player that realistically isnt going to push your team over the edge to suddenly become super good. Jensen isnt Showmaker or Chovy or something. Hes a better Powerofevil. I dont really blame teams for not caring to spend that much on him.
hm8acbz,Hummingberg,11/26/2021,1,108.0,That’s hilarious lol. I went to a competitive school too and I remember a senior telling me as a freshman you can only choose two of the follow three: academics social life and sleep. Too true. I chose sleep and a social life. My grades show it.

I dont think hes dumb enough to go from 1.4million a year to 200k- or whatever is needed to shift himself to a mid-tier team. My guess is that hes warming the bench until Summer at the least when the big spenders need to save their season if their new mid doesnt work out.
hm7n0eu,ice_wallow_qhum,11/26/2021,1,1.0,First sentence. So regular bounties should be removed too? I agree that it should need some sight into it but makig it random or on a tomer sounds weird.

hm7zfvi,RiftHunter4,11/26/2021,1,3.0,It would break landing. Minions are a big factor in early game lane control. Im not gonna jump on you if I have to walk back through a fat minion wave. Running to jungle isnt always safe and neither is going around the minions in some areas. With how much damage they deal being able to walk through them might make diving champs too strong early game. Just my guess though.

hm79bmc,grapplingmanx9,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Honestly Ive been reading this drama and while it was entertaining at 1st now its just boring. I think Upset did them dirty leaving before worlds and not telling why. Worlds isnt a tournament that happens once a year and everyone is invited it can be once in a lifetime opportunity and a way to carve your legacy. To make yourself look good and be worth more money (and not be teamless). Upset mightve screwed over more than 1 career with this move and I think its a fair right for them to be mad at him. Furthermore I think being a professional athlete comes at a price - privacy. Its like working at call center and crying because of mean clients. Its just how it is furthermore fans can make your career (raise your stock) or just bambard you with shit on twitter. Now I dont think harrassing anyone twitter is right thing to do but such big actions are bound to have consequences. I quite honestly feel that both Adam Nisqy and Bwipo had shittiest time of their lives during worlds especially Bwipo who too had relationship issues and I can bet you that the only thought going thru his head was fuck man wish I can fuck off from this tournament and try to fix my relationship. And then Upset comes across as quite arrogant saying it was HIS dream HIS goal etc. Its everyones goal and dream its a team sport and then even when he does not attend the tournament he wants/tries to replace players because they arent upto HIS standards like I know you want Adam to shut up but I think you should shut up sometimes too. If you dont want to reveal any details just delete twitter altogether or be like: family issues wont tell because thats the key message from all of those posts not bringing any new or important information and leaving everything to everyones interpretation.
hm7zd7m,ConscienceNot,11/26/2021,1,20.0,Talking about lvl 4. He can beat Xin. He beats trundle. He beats hecarim. He beats Vi ( she is kinda weak this season ). He beats graves. He beats Jarvan. He beats Kayn. He beats ekko. He beats gragas. He beats Lee. He can beat Noc. He beats Viego. He beats Reksai. He beats Zac. He beats even shyvana if I remember correctly.  He doesnt beat WW Olaf Voli and Scarner and Yi because of his fkin W. And udyr.
hm762we,MIRAGEone,11/26/2021,1,133.0,That was a good watch. Wing has impressive range but just an overall good performance.
hm76uug,RektByDefault,11/26/2021,1,41.0,Im wondering if it wouldnt have been better to perma-roam bot and get Cait super fed. If Camille is losing 1v1 to an early game Nasus thats not exactly the person I want to invest in.
hm723eo,--------V--------,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,I mean maybe? I don’t know what I wouldn’t tell the public. My ex wife had a terrible miscarriage 7 months in I told my employer and everyone else. My friends and family knew of my ugly divorce I definitely wouldn’t be keeping stuff like that from my teammates no.   I think Adam sounded like an entitled bitch which at the end of the day sucks but I’m siding with him and upset comes off looking awful especially dancing around it months later still. Everyone has had plenty of time to recover from whatever “tragedy” he claims happened.
hm7a5xx,Earth-Red,11/26/2021,1,144.0,This. Servers 10 years a go were pretty different than now and Riot is a lot richer as well.

hm7m8ph,Zuldak,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Its better than the first statement but the situation is still festering. Frankly it looks like upset just doesnt care about his career the team or team mates. He would rather claim privacy as a green light to just leave any time he wants.

hm7it4p,Deolrin,11/26/2021,1,12326.0,This is entirely guesswork but how about this?     Jayce generated a shield but he instinctively protected Mel not Viktor. Viktor dies / nearly dies in the explosion and both because he felt betrayed by Jayce and out of desperation to survive he makes the final push towards GLORIOUS EVOLUTION.

hm77lrs,Ok_Dot9858,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Utter nonsense you’re basing your judgement on assumptions. There certainly are personal matters that you don’t want to share outside of your family/closest friends. Claiming Upset would use such an incident as pretence is simply blatant speculation also slandering. Which fuels the hate we can currently see from the very civilized french community.  If they needed justification they could have gotten it from Fnatics management. Them allowing Upsets departure should be enough indication for the validity of his leaving. At least if you are mature and professional about it
hm7gbbm,Jazdu,11/26/2021,1,1301.0,Dont want to throw hate at all but when Perkzs dad died we all knew why he wasnt playing (a very important reason) and when Doublelifts brother did what he did (extremely important situation) we all knew .  I wonder what the fuck happened to Upset family to top those 2 situations.
hm7jw0h,THE_MUNDO_TRAIN,11/26/2021,1,150.0,Xmithie might look tough on camera but everyone praises him for being such a lovable guy and a strong mental booster. He was literally the Perkz before... Perkz.

hm76jtx,Tanriyung,11/26/2021,1,4.0,0. I disagree with the premise that League is a crush or be crushed game most of my games are close with often some form of comebacks.  1. The point I disagree the most with you are basically asking to delete some champions outright. Also targeted abilities are not unfair they are stronger than skillshot by default but thats taken into account in the balance.   2. The only real result youd get from that is an increase in bot leveled accounts which makes it worse for new player as those bots uses coop vs ai.  Youll slightly increase the average skill in ranked overall but that wont actually change the experience for anyone as you are matchdd with players of your skill anyway.  3. Sure itd be nice not actually that important through. People oversell tutorials.  4. Would stop players from trading champions during pick phase and generally would increase massively the toxicity in normal games because ranked players would feel forced to play normals terrible idea.  5. Sure would be nice not gonna happen through and you already know why.  6. Text based tips are the 2nd worst way to make people learn something so itd be useless but sure I wouldnt be against it as it would be optional.
hm8fq2c,RaccoonD,11/26/2021,1,307.0,To be fair something like that happens in LAS too I try to speak in the most neutral Spanish possible as to not give away i’m either chilean or argentinian both sides have a bad rep

hm7p5hd,Migraine-,11/26/2021,1,,The point was never really about management youve kind of tried to lead everything off on a tangent.  The point was about how his teammates have acted.  But to address your point yes I think employees should be treated with empathy and the assumption of honesty until they prove themselves unworthy of deserving that. I dont think anyone should be asked to show their fucking relatives death certificate to some manager.

hm7ize4,begentlewithmyheart,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Yeah people act like the Fnatic players were just normal coworkers. But being teammates on a LoL team means everyone is practicing very long hours and sacrificing large parts of their life for the good of the team.

hm7mqq2,SocialistScissors,11/26/2021,1,13.0,Because the lane doesnt just reset back to nuetral. Every action you take on the lane impacts where the next lane will be and where the one after that will be and so on. Even if nobody is there touching the wave for any reason other than last hitting can ruin a lane equilibrium.
hm765rt,Athaelan,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Its likely not even about his wife we dont know who it is about the whole point of him keeping it private is to protect who and what it is about. All we know is its someone in his family I dont know why so many believe the wife thing which is just speculation from Adam who admitted he obviously doesnt know anything (his whole issue with it).

hm71enw,th3kandyking,11/26/2021,1,108.0,I dont want to be that guy that defends your friend....and anyone can argue this all they want. Bronze and Silver are a different beast. Some games truly are at the mercy of your teamates. I have a friend that could easily lane and win a game in G3-P4 but the dude is stuck in Bronze - Silver. Why?   Well he plays ADC and try as you might you are somewhat dependent on your support. Who may deserve to be in bronze. Now Im not saying my friend doesnt have a lot of improvement to make but thats video games in general. No one has a perfect game.   That being said I believe the very best thing you can do if you Shouldnt be in Silver Or Shouldnt be in Bronze or Shouldnt be in gold lol. Play 2-4 Champs max grind in a role that can carry (top/mid/jg) and grind out games on the same champs over and over until you dont use u.gg because you know the match-up and you know exactly what to do based on their comp and your role and how you plan to win the game.   If thats via enabling your team or split pushing towers until nexus you find your niche. But blaming others and doing the same thing on repeat is why you get Hardstuck.   If you go 5/1/1 as the ADC but Always lose because top gets feed and shits on me  Maybe you should go top get feed and shit on other people?   Its a mental block for sure because Im the say way. lol.  if you are better than the elo you are in then you will eventually climb especially if you play 1000 games.   If you are not....well then thats the elo you belong in for now. I can say that doing the same thing and blaming teamates etc isnt going to get your Winrate up.   Most players refuse to even acknowledge that their mechanics are horrible like an ADC that doesnt A click. Or a mage that clicks on themselves to self cast as opposed to using alt or a hotkey.   Point being there is no way you are below Plat and have no way to improve mechanically and individually.  but there is a possibility that you ARE good enough and hinder yourself even before the game starts with role champ select and other things like not muting all chat and team chat 🤣  good luck out there guys.
hm7kxo1,RemoteAnalysis3809,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,>Three of his teammates agree they knew absolutely nothing about the situation and the severity of it in any form  That is false. The teammates dont know what exactly happened but even Adam said in his twitlonger that he knew its a family emergency that had to do with Upsets wife. I assume same thing goes with Bwipo and Nisqy as in they all knew its a family emergency that had to do with Upsets wife (especially considering Bwipos weird twitlonger that we didnt realize is a jab at Upsets situation until now) .  That is not knew absolutely nothing about the situation and the severity of it in any form. In fact the statement here also clarified they got two different meetings about the situation before Upset left.   &#x200B  >feel that not enough information was given.  That is the main problem. The reality is what is enough info anyway?   Upset and management view enough info as I have a family emergency involving my wife that I need to deal with while clearly Adam Nisqy and Bwipo dont think thats enough.   We can see it in this very same thread. Upset supporters be like coworkers should not know your personal lifes detail. Your employer knowing is more than enough vs Upset hater be like Its a sports team and so people deserve to know because worlds is the height of everyones career and Upset not explaining his wifes situation to his teammates is disrespectful and worthy of condemnation.  It all boils down to what you want to prioritize in life and Upset already made that decision months ago when he left.
hm75p28,Wizzdom,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,In this case I dont think there is any reason to believe Upset left for bad reasons. But family emergency is the most generic excuse there is. Surely Upset or management could have done a better job of communicating the severity of what happened without giving away personal details. He wants to keep it private but trust me Id do the same in his shoes.  All that being said I think Adam is more salty about being replaced.
hm7lliv,godfrey1,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,whats better  to tell your teammates whats the issue and explain that its more improtant than what youve worked for 3 years on  or   make everyone speculate for god knows how long what it is and lose all the trust your teammates had in you along with ruining your public image  hard choice tbh
hm7v8vr,uncertainrandompal,11/26/2021,1,124.0,you are trying to justify someone who didn’t said anything have history of irresponsible decisions in life and just known as douchebag if you ever seen his streams.   well no wonder why so many people are so bad in league with such mental gymnastics.

hm8amua,AshesOntheFire778,11/26/2021,1,51.0,Yea unfortunately low elo has too much uncoordination and no cooperation which makes nasus thrives very well in this situation. An advice for you Op try to learn some mages at mid lane they have good range and cc to counter Nasus. Most assassins arent great against Nasus.
hm80inv,sluethmeister,11/26/2021,1,6.0,I saw speculation that it could be Silco but this theory is eliminated in WW’s bio where it is said that WW saw a bearded man reflecting in the eyes of a beggar who WW was getting ready to eat.  He is also from Zaun and had to be captured by Silco at some point or at the very least Silco’s chemist. We never got to see what happened to Vander’s body.
hm79peu,nepaesa,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,Except it doesnt give public attention to only tell your teammates who Id expect would keep your secret if it was as serious as Upset claims.   If anything not telling created more speculation drama and unwanted attention
hm8iz65,TaintedQuintessence,11/26/2021,1,32.0,Ah I wasnt aware of rule changes I thought it just so happened that this year no lck team decided to field starters. The article doesnt really mention an explicit rule change either.
hm7znm4,Sekaizen,11/26/2021,1,166.0,I instinctively used the term lit. But sick works just as well!   Spot on performance <3
hm79y8g,kazuyaminegishi,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,False assumption that the word emergency doesnt mean... emergency?  The rest of your comment is just long-winded nonsense. If you create a fictional scenario where your paranoid nonsense is justified then you can warp the meaning of any situation.   I could easily say oh but what if Upsets wife was assaulted by someone outside their home and she feels unsafe at home and shes traumatized and claim that Im right. I have no idea what happened and I dont need to know what happened. To him it was an emergency thats all thats important.  If my mom called me and told me my grandmother was dying I wouldnt take off work nor would I find that an emergency because I dont like my grandmother. However if your grandmother raised you and shes the most important person in your life then this would be an emergency for you. Using my personal viewpoint I could say whatever people die all the time and yet that doesnt make it not an emergency for you.  The fact he described it as an emergency for himself makes it an emergency for himself. Re-explaining what he did using long-winded synonyms is stupid because youve convinced yourself that the phrase family emergency is meaningless. If Adam doubts him Adam is free to do so. But the issue isnt in how the problem was presented its that Adam just doesnt believe him.
hm7kyjt,SNSDave,11/26/2021,1,2.0,Yes that is where it comes from.
hm8807p,TH3RM4L33,11/26/2021,1,159.0,Could I see the replays as well?
hm78med,Vangorf,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Exactly. If Upset wouldve said to FNC that he fucked Adams/Nisqys Worlds lets keep them on the roster to give them another chance then its fine but he legit said Adam is not up to his standards. Like bruh he went to World in a split from ERL. How many years did it took for Upset to get there? Fuck his standards and his behaviour.
hm8ii6c,Tilterino247,11/26/2021,1,,Which is my whole first statement that you argued with? Teams dont care about winning. Double lift Jensen was a free trip to worlds for literally any team. But they dont care about winning.

hm79iqz,Amsement,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,Theres not really a right answer that would leave both sides satisfied. Having the opportunity you spent so much time towards dashed away without an explanation would leave most people really unsatisfied and/or bitter. At the same time Upset has the right to not disclose specifics to anyone he doesnt want knowing.  I dont know how anyone on the outside can reasonably take sides without having the actual context.   I will say that these twitlongers are rarely ever a good idea. They dont serve any real purpose as people that dislike you enough to harass you on social media arent going to stop just because you explain yourself. Like Adams tweet is mostly stuff he should have just written in a diary or something not gone public with.

hm7ngoi,SaulJoker,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Upset wanting to play with a different top laner doesn’t have anything to do with Upset’s situation at worlds.  You’re painting it as if Adam was justified for saying what he said when he wasn’t.  Sure obviously Adam is not going to be happy with his teammate who left during worlds and also wants to replace him. But that doesn’t really change Adam talking shit about his teammates and Fnatic.  Adam is salty that he got replaced and was never told the details of what happened with Upset. But Adam doesn’t have the right to force himself to stay on a team that doesn’t want him nor does he have the right to pry into other people’s private lives.  If you stopped to think about the multitude of terrible things that could have happened to Upset’s family you’d realize that Adam is in the wrong here.

hm8al1j,Yetti2Quick,11/26/2021,1,113.0,Congrats man! This is actually the first year I got plat also and I’m still climbing hard almost to P2 now. I gave up on this year and basically got tilted and started only playing Xerath ADC to at least enjoy myself and piss my teammates off. Fking went on some massive streaks and was able to finish the season plat 4. Won like 70% of my matches over the last 50 games to end. Funny enough the only games I usually lost was when my team got Tilted in champ select from me picking Xerath ADC and then they int the game for us. “Losing cuz no real AD” is the best thing to see when you’re winning 70% or ur games and the enemy adc is 3-10 every game. Lolol.

hm8q5os,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,165.0,Yeah Im sure hed play way better if he focused on gameplay and no entertainment at all. When it comes to being pressured by players I havent felt like oh man this guy is too good since maybe like s6 when I played vs bjergsen. Obviously Ive lost lane a lot since then to many different players but I would know when the mistake was made and would accept the lane is loss at that moment.

hm76eku,happygreenturtle,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,No I dont agree at all. I personally couldnt care less whether I know about Upsets situation and given how private is apparently is I wouldnt want to know.   The problem that I do have with all of this is not even that Upset didnt tell his teammates what happened but that he apparently made no effort to help them understand on an emotional level where he was coming from. Its really cold to leave within a day of the most important tournament of the year and then not even speak to your team to repair the damage when you come back. From Bwipos comments Upset *didnt even speak to his team at all about it before he left*. Bwipo was made aware by somebody else in the organisation that Upset would be going home. 12 hours before the first game.  The way Adam writes this is as though Upset/FNC said Sorry I have to be with my girlfriend left and then upon coming back made no effort to reconcile with the teammates he abandoned (even if for good reason) and actually attempted to replace them behind their backs as soon as whatever drama was happening in his personal life was dealt with. That is.. kind of messed up
hm84u0m,xLawling,11/26/2021,1,92.0,that just means an account where he plays simultaneously support and jungle theyre the fill roles 90% of the time
hm7faxu,UnironicallyWatchSAO,11/26/2021,1,75.0,Yeah dw about it playing this game without a duo is boring and tilting as hell. And anyone who duos often enough knows that its not easier at all if anything its harder due to the matchmaking fucking you over but it sure does makes playing ranked more fun.
hm6y5yd,BitterWillingness205,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,yeah this is the one part of the story that sticks out a little too much to ignore
hm745w9,IAM-French,11/26/2021,1,83.0,I love wunder but thats like calling the 2016 cavs the Kevin Love lineup
hm7jl6y,meowmeowmelissa,11/26/2021,1,5.0,So the point is not to destroy the towers of all lanes but to destroy the possible ones to advance the wave in each one of them to worry the enemy team while my team joins together to dominate the entire map?
hm8h2th,Far-Abroad8185,11/26/2021,1,4.0,Xerath was really trying his hardest to win that game i think
hm84rp9,radrians,11/26/2021,1,107.0,Congrats bro. Good job.
hm70709,iLLuSi0NN,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,So for example if ur father is beating ur mother would u tell them more than family emergency? I wouldnt. Imagine if it would leak and all the chat spams during the game or Twitter replies
hm8et9d,jjhassert,11/26/2021,1,121.0,we dont care either
hm728l5,Pokemon_Only,11/26/2021,1,36.0,Is that the right mentality for a player with such potential though? Instead of always wanting to play with that one player seeing him gain a passion to join another top team and go for the worlds trophy again would be so cool. Damwon are right there I just want to see it already.
hm8iash,AnonLXIX,11/26/2021,1,569.0,I am confused are there more changes on the way or is a couple rune changes a handful of items and 2 more drakes the WHOLE season 12 experience?
hm7cd57,AGunShyFirefly,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,Yep. Emotional intensity likely created a sense of urgency that was not there. Happens all the time especially in less experienced people. He knows it too which is the reason for all the mystery.
hm7c9u6,NathanBlackwell,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,My favorite was the Russian guys who would stomp the entire server or tilt out of control.  God damn this conversations makes me want to watch some CTF demos again.
hm8k4uw,Altruistic-Can-2685,11/26/2021,1,140.0,Just curious then why would you say it was the hardest?  Everything you mentioned and your stats make it seem like it was overall the easiest
hm6y5iz,phantomace1111,11/26/2021,1,62.0,No offense to that guy but that channel seems to be entirely clickbait smurfing videos definitely not something that should be used as an actual guide. One glance at the stats would tell you that predator (and Zhonyas) on Eve is horrendous.   Its like trying to type as fast as possible with 2 fingers instead of 10. If youre used to using only 2 fingers you can still get quite fast but in the long run its worth taking the time to switch to 10.
hm7l8lc,InactivePudding,11/26/2021,1,205.0,I did not make them homophobic its not on me to treat them with kid gloves
hm71yqn,inavigateindankmenes,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Upset said on his first tl that he was transparent with hyli and Yamato.
hm7w6b3,Karpeeezy,11/26/2021,1,89.0,The US can print seemingly as much money as they want - nobody is betting against the US anytime soon.   The perks of being the #1 superpower largest market and running the worlds reserve currency.
hm7ri3b,FatAssInLatin,11/26/2021,1,89.0,> worlds reserve currency  the older currency has printed more money shocker
hm8h2kw,uchuucowboy,11/26/2021,1,172.0,Good grief. I dont even main talon but his E is one of the clunkiest abilities in the game. Maybe code it like aatrox E? But with the MS scaling and a longer range? This would also fix those situations where you cast it over a wall and jump off at an odd angle rather than the opposite side
hm6y38b,MrZeral,11/26/2021,1,141.0,Did the same can confirm eune is chill compared to euw.
hm7hziq,LuxWizard,11/26/2021,1,144.0,Omg. I absolutely love this. I love the opening I love this show. Im happy.
hm8p09p,Jimmyhopps,11/26/2021,1,1517.0,Why didn’t Vi let Ekko carry Cait so she can stay with Powder / Jinx. It feels so out of character.
hm6ydnm,bocababuniors,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Firstly thats not an example of irony. Secondly there is a massive difference between criticizing someone on Reddit and harassing them on Twitter. Thirdly saying that its not like he chose for his family to suffer something clearly devastating is a total straw man.
hm72cb7,Seneido,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,if he doesnt want anyone to speculate he maybe should have said the truth? trust is given not earned.
hm7mnbn,ok99988,11/26/2021,1,555.0,Does anyone know when the gifting center will be back up? Or how long fixing things like this usually takes? My girlfriend wants the evelynn squink in tft but the gifting center has been down for a bit and she cant exactly afford it rn
hm7ap8z,zaplayer20,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,Shows a bit of his personality. While Upset is a great ADC to me it smells like Forgiven attitude and lets not forget Forgiven was in the end forgotten. I do understand that family issues shouldnt be told to anybody even work collegues or teammates but the way he left it was like intentional. If the heat was already on before his departure than it means he was a drama queen who maybe didnt wanted to be at worlds. Looking at Perkz he had the balls and courage to tell his teammates why he left and it isnt the only case of players leaving for a few days or weeks in the middle of the tournament. Also the fact that he wanted to change everybody except Hylli means that he was part of a toxic environment that may or may not be caused by himself. I dont use twitter nor harass him i am just saying my opinions based on what the trio write in their TL. I also cant forget that in 2020 with Origen something similar happened Origen imploded in summer because of a certain figure... it can be Alphari or it could have been Upset. I tend to believe it was Upset because he wanted to get rid of Destiny and got Jacktroll which we all know how it ended.
hm72mi0,Redryhno,11/26/2021,1,108.0,To give the argument a fair shake though theres an extra layer of minimap that the ui tells you is the actual game.   Like seriously go into a normal and see how far away you have to click to not have it register on the minimap.   Now how much of this is my flipped ui I dont know but its been a persistent issue since the map rework.
hm88tnh,Neversync,11/26/2021,1,298.0,Romanians and Polish people in league are a different breed.
hm7vke7,vegeful,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,His point is that if u truly have emergency try to act like ur emergency is important. Try play in alt account not playing on account that is easily being recognize. He should know what controversy will happen because of that. Hell at least play another game that is not league or alt account that nobody know.   Its like telling you mother that u sick and u really are sick. Then u proceed to play game for 10 hour openly in front of your mother.   My point is if u playing league or any game that fine but can u at least cover it up. He love privacy but cant keep his activity during world private?    Trust are earn and not given by playing league during world u actually reduce the team trust of your family emergency. If he cant trust his team dont expect your team to given u trust blindly either.   Instead of trust it bring a lot of speculation on the severity of the emergency.
hm745c2,ApplePitou,11/26/2021,1,2.0,Very sad masterpiece with wonderful details and colors additionally I still cant believe Jinx has such a sad past but such madness is born for a reason :3
hm8ai9q,pielord599,11/26/2021,1,166.0,It also gives less vision for areas that are safer or already have vision of. Like wards in your base or near towers give less vision score. In addition wards in an actual lane give less vision. I think there might be ones based on whether its in enemy jungle or river or stuff like that but I cant quite remember
hm7o6rt,WingedNation,11/26/2021,1,120.0,Unrelated to the thread but I just played an aram against you a couple of days ago. Ggs again!
hm8bbs6,doglop,11/26/2021,1,9.0,Of course it still doesnt mean it should be effective on every champ that isnt from that class. Sett is a bruiser with cc as an example that doesnt mean every bruiser shoukd be able to build it as not every skirmisher should build shieldbow
hm7id5q,atastyfire,11/26/2021,1,35.0,Did you need them to give some sort of exposition so you dont have to read between the lines?

hm8pem5,DogShroom,11/26/2021,1,13.0,I think 4 is intended. Viego possessing a body under tower doesn’t reset turret aggro on him. I’m pretty sure Akshan has the same problem as 1. It also seems like the exclamation mark is inconsistent and buggy starting from 11.23 (from my Akshan experience)
hm8e3mj,JukebocksTV,11/26/2021,1,12.0,She is weak early game
hm7ikw0,FabioSxO,11/26/2021,1,,agree :3
hm793jk,thrownawayzs,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,the thing about humor and context is that people who ignore them get caught up in the surperficial of the joke and see it as at a negative connotation of the speaker. rather than a jumping point of bridging a situation using an established trend to show both and understanding and disagreement with the situation.
hm70im9,Kataleps,11/26/2021,1,108.0,Ima just say that this post is probably better suited for r/summonerschool   Anyhow your boy doesnt want to get better. He doesnt understand fundamentals and refuses to learn them. 1k games in Bronze quite literally means hes hardstuck.
hm8762q,Halseyqueen,11/26/2021,1,72.0,Thank you so much! You are so sweet ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)
hm7aycg,lppur3ps3,11/26/2021,1,4457.0,Its really barely any bigger. A lot of co-workers see each other 5 days a week 8 hours a day in teams of less than 10. You do know people on teams a lot of times have no interest in actually liking each other or wanting to be friends too. And either way the level this matter is at is so high that even if theyre more than a team it still wouldnt fucking matter lmao.
hm79g57,Carpax,11/26/2021,1,1054.0,They are all telling the truth though. Upset specifically states he didnt disclose the exact reasoning behind the family emergency to anyone but yamato. He wanted to tell Hylli as well but he didnt feel he needed to know he trusted Upsets judgement.

hm7pbm3,IWouldLikeAName,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,You think FNC would keep a guy that would leave at any small reason given to him? No. The org and staff were satisfied with the reasoning upset gave. So much so that afaik we didnt even hear a single rumor of him being replaced when Hans Carzzy and Rekkles were all available
hm7ik3v,sscyth1,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,then just tell you fking teamates
hm89su7,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,108.0,haha I really would love to sacrifice sleep but its too important. With school competition and maintaining the 5 accounts it has led to me having no social life! wohoooo!!!
hm716v9,ConsiderationOdd8943,11/26/2021,1,21.0,u have 15w-12l in silver.   i have 37-9 in plat.    Ur kda doesnt mean shit if u still manage to lose 46% of ur game in fking silver kiddo )
hm703fx,EnjoyThisAfternoon,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,LMAOOOO
hm85snb,MapPotential9009,11/26/2021,1,71.0,Jungle is so crucial to the game now that it shouldnt be an autofill position. Having a decent jungler can make or break a game these days that it should be a specific role you queue for.
hm7kzph,Migraine-,11/26/2021,1,92.0,Perhaps. But two things:  1) That doesnt make what youve experienced right  2) I would hope a professional league of legends team behaves more like the kind of close-knit team that Im used to than a faceless mega-company like McDonalds.
hm75s50,supern00b64,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Maybe his wife pushed him to play league with her to cheer him up. Do you really think that he would or his family would let him just wallow in misery for the whole time he was home?
hm8gey7,doglop,11/26/2021,1,11.0,Thats just an example its like saying a marksman should be able to use ap items at their max potential. Brusier can use thornmail just not as effective as tanks easy as that

hm7tmd6,LakersLAQ,11/26/2021,1,161.0,So you argue baseless conjecture and then assume that every owner likes having their players contract jailed? lol. If anything TL is losing out on money by still having to pay Jensen his salary.
hm7a1y9,SamsungBaker,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,Adam in the french tl said that Upset literally hard forced for Alphari to replace him   And i agree Nisqy had poor performance at Worlds but he literally hard carried FNC during playoffs.   And can you even blame them for their poor performance at Worlds when they learned that Upset wont be playing ? Literally everyone except Bean mental boomed at Worlds because of Upset leaving.
hm7a7ho,963852741hc,11/26/2021,1,29.0,They get payed more if they sign longer contracts blame the players for being greedy
hm8h5r4,ThyPrasiolite,11/26/2021,1,6.0,Fun and really deep game short enough games to be played a lot long enough so that every game feels like a different experience and over everything else Riot really doesnt fear giving crazy shit every time.  Remember the homeless fast hobo meta? Remember the Rumble/Morgana jg meta? The impact of Viego in the game? That time everybody used goredrinker? The second time that happened? Stridebreaker being crazy being changed and being crazy but on another set of champions?
hm8j4of,SocialistScissors,11/26/2021,1,26.0,I mean swain APC got away with a 55% winrate for the first half of this year (53% for the second half) surely vayne should be allowed to have those numbers this coming year.  \- Sincerely a Vayne abuser )
hm7mbw2,aglimmerof,11/26/2021,1,540.0,Fucking upvoted for the Emiya reference
hm83bvp,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,92.0, Thank you. I think the #1 thing is mentality. Even in Challenger or any rank Ive realized that only focusing on what youre doing and how you effect your team is what really matters. In game I think the 3 most important are game knowledge -> maximizing gold income -> mechanics. Champ wise have versatile playstyles and a small champ pool. All the things youve listed is important and should still be worked on.
hm85vnz,LordKnt,11/26/2021,1,143.0,Yeah nice last line very nice of you to let everybody know that youre a clown lmao who the fuck cares about that except cringelords?
hm749wm,Zepth01,11/26/2021,1,41.0,Not really. Many of the pros play on tablets strictly which is standard for mobile games. Playing on your phone until masters is fine unless you want to go pro but I assume you want to play casually.  Btw I recommend if you are going to play on your phone do the tutorial which explains many controls features you can use for QoL and also try spending some time trying different settings for controls until you feel its comfortable.
hm7wpl7,mazrrim,11/26/2021,1,,people hear what they want to Dopa has called jungle the easiest role to climb on and has also called mid with mechanically easy champions easy to climb on.  The entire perception of support as high level gameplay is honestly held back by silver/gold people duoq boosting bad players to various low ranks. I know 1 person who got boosted to gold playing yuumi with a diamond ad so this means I know the master tier support main is worse than my sick silver 3 zed play
hm6yno5,Zepth01,11/26/2021,1,41.0,They are good I play very fluidly and if holding the phone gets tiresome you can always buy a controller which the game is compatible with.

hm7zuhd,cygodx,11/26/2021,1,88.0,I swear this sub is the same as /r/nba where people talk about players they watched a highlight of once.  Same for when nuguri got omega deathcamped and still carrying late-game and people saying he was washed in that series...

hm7mmy5,rueckhand,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,He tweeted about this back when it happened so how would they not know this?
hm704si,gafour,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,I dont understand why people still talk about the reason he left. What i want to know is why has adams frustration that seems to be building up all split from the way I see it was not adressed by the whole fnc management. Dont they have a team therapist ? The whole team has blown up and it seems it was happening even before. All the team seemed disfynctionnal by the end of it. I dont know how a team like fncs doesnt know how to deal with the veteran/rookie balance.
hm738ai,moroheus,11/26/2021,1,42.0,Even if he told them what was going on he would still have left. And it wasnt something that happened to him but to his family. His teammates arent entitled to know what happened to someone they might not even know. His families privacy is more important than the players curiosity.
hm6ypf2,No_Management_1177,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Yes you are
hm82f1j,VanNostrim,11/26/2021,1,2.0,Good to know.  Thanks!
hm79dyw,comso20,11/26/2021,1,1054.0,> why the fk u wont trust ur teammates?  because they might not be friends? maybe he trusts them with playing the game but goes i dont trust them not to put this on social media which considering Adam went and spilled shit all over social media the second he was out of Fnatic might have been justified.  > just a vogue one is enough u dont need a really permission just let them know its very urgent if u wont do that how tf they got the urgency  Considering we as the public got a vuage statement stressing the urgency Id assume that management and coaches probably gave a vauge explination to the players as well. he literally did exactly what you asked but is getting flamed.
hm7wdiz,Free-Pop4661,11/26/2021,1,7.0,It seems to me that you are probably in low Eli. As a support main you are better off with someone getting the kill then them getting away
hm7wxr8,Hope_u_hav_a_gud_day,11/26/2021,1,246.0,Ivern won’t change unless they allow for his late game to be more rewarding.  Season 10 ivern was perfect IMO.  I could survive the early and scale in the mid to late game.  No points of iverns kit do you feel powerful during the game.  His late game power spike gets mitigated by serpents fang hard.  I haven’t touched the game in a while.  It’s just not fun to see a champion get nerfed into the ground.  No compensations buffs at all.  It’s sad to see enchanter support items be so bad that you can’t do well unless your base numbers are crazy good.  Playing other games is way more enjoyable IMO.
hm87wue,TH3RM4L33,11/26/2021,1,159.0,I dont know about other bugs but Ive seen him floating in his Q animation every week lmao
hm78oio,phieldworker,11/26/2021,1,4.0,Because league is just a video game at the end of a day. Unless you are pro a content creator coach etc league should just be a video game to you. It’s ok to want to do well climb ranks win and what not. But it shouldn’t take over your mind. If you wanna still play then here are some things to stop doing. Stop spamming hours of games daily. Play like a set of 3 and do something else not leave related. Stop micro managing your allies and stop expecting them to always know what the right thing to do is. The more you try to control people the more frustrating the game will be. Play different modes than just rank in the end LP is just a number.
hm6yx8a,CoBe_1g,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Its a little bit different here. Once you join a team you are in a brotherhood with your teammates where all of you are working toward a collective goal. Upsets decision to leave the team was detrimental and his teammates deserve to know why countless of hours they spent just gone to shit. He doesnt need to get into details just enough so that his teammates can get closure. For some of these people doing good at Worlds might be the biggest accomplishment theyll ever achieve in their life so they deserve a damn good explanation from Upset.
hm7q47g,No_Principle_4593,11/26/2021,1,, he is the biggest reason for fnatic failure in their last and biggest tournament of the year automatically making him their worst player without any doubt :)
hm6y5q7,Street_Cookie_4226,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Hyli sided with him not because he knew the reason tho simply because hes Mother Teresa. The other three can be just normal humen and he still pissed them off so badly thats not what mature dealing should end up with
hm7617d,Hrkeol,11/26/2021,1,42.0,And what does that has to do with the situation in hand? Youre still implying that this is the reason why Upset left with no evidence plus I think you need to have some specific information about the relationship to judge it and not just based on set in stone numbers and past experiences. getting married for a visa how do you know that? Your whole argument is based on believing that his wife is a bad person based partly on her past and the rest based on your own biases and manufacturing theories.
hm7tk5o,asidcabej,11/26/2021,1,99.0,G2 having best level 1? Certainly not in groups
hm8t38j,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,182.0,I hit rank 52 in season 4 but challenger was only 50 slots. I started in S3 and hit challenger for the first time in S6.  I watched so many vods watched SO MANY DOPA VODS. I also had good teammates I could play with that helped me learn more but I was already challenger by then. I think for learning theres so many good public information out there like skillcapped and what not that you can find on youtube. My favorite off meta champ is probably kindred/singed mid.
hm8sp0m,647boom,11/26/2021,1,155.0,At that point ask yourself why you’re playing the game at all
hm8oj7q,Pecheuer,11/26/2021,1,84.0,My wifes boyfriend finds this offensive he told me
hm8r9wi,Banglatiger,11/26/2021,1,8.0,That’s a really hard question to answer tbh. There’s too many champs and too many styles of play to really make a decision for someone else. I’d first figure out what primary role and secondary role you like first then go from there.  Once you got that down figure out if you like assassins high dps bruisers tanks supports or mages then once you got that it’ll narrow your pool significantly and then master maybe all the champs that fill that filter since it’s much smaller and learn one champ that you’re comfortable in an unfamiliar for each other filter.   For example. I love side lanes. Can’t stand jg will tolerate mid and support   For top I’ve mastered most of the fighters and a couple tanks. For bot I’ve mastered maybe 7 adcs and I have like 4 pocket picks for mid and 2 for support and 2 Jg champs I could play even if I have a bad day.
hm73372,DR_Flashfire,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Yes and every one of your favourite players has probably done that
hm7mier,hochan17,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,And yet here we are with 3 people saying that was the case. I think the most likely scenario is that Upset didnt say anything to the team and just told management like how you would in a real job. However staff didnt properly convey the severity of the situation and now were here with this mess
hm89ixd,Gazskull,11/26/2021,1,7.0,\- Sincerly someone that complains even when a bunch health and ap are released
hm71ihn,aithosrds,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,I’m not saying he needs to tell people about his family and if that’s what you think then you’re an idiot.  I’m saying that refusing to tell his teammates giving zero information to the community is toxic and will only have a negative effect and create drama.  He could have said “someone in my family is gravely ill and I need to be there” without giving any more information and that would have been completely accepted.  Not only that but instead of creating confusion and hate the community would largely have gotten behind him and sent him well wishes and support.  I’m not saying he should have spilled his heart out and given specifics on the situation but he should have said *something* besides a “very personal family issue”.
hm73p8q,BLUELAMBORGHINI64,11/26/2021,1,3.0,jungle is really weak this patch man . i havent got one crab this entire pre season
hm815lf,lppur3ps3,11/26/2021,1,103.0,Most of those players are ironically all from one team. Whereas TL doesnt have that rep and EG didnt really get a chance to ever have that rep
hm81f30,learclow,11/26/2021,1,18.0,Well right now I dont have like a standard painting process and I always end trying stuff on the go so it takes a lot of time. It took me 9 hours to get this result
hm7rdyg,Nymwhen,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Totally agree. Communication isnt always about saying details at all. It can be about looking people in the eye and showing u care. That u were thinking about them too. If you connect honestly to people they will give trust.   I think upset was just not able to give his teammates the required headspace they deserved in the moment.  His head was full of his own worries and he prob didnt handle it well in the moment. Wasnt thinking “what can I do to leave the team in an okay state”. Which is understandable when you are in a crisis but still a bit shitty.  But even after he never seemed to have reached out to his teammates. And their resentment just grew with everything else adding on top. And with no communication and a trust that was completely withered away in the end Adam could only see upset as the villain. And even convinced himself he left for nothing. His lash out was just very unfortunate for everyone.   Fnatic managment shouldve gotten everyone in the same room. I think just talking to eachother wouldve solved it.
hm74r3z,AsahiMizunoThighs,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,nah. privacy is a thing
hm8pz2a,Mejalu,11/26/2021,1,26.0,Bro the point since season 3 has been to win the game and sweat as you call it. Snowball was far worse then than it is now.   Playing the game until the Nexus blows up is what you agreed to do when you clicked find match. Not only try if its going good for me. If thats the case then why even play league of legends. There are plenty of other games where you can completely avoid this.

hm7kz7p,dragunityag,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Reading Upsets posts leads me to believe that he is god awful at communication so it makes sense.
hm8jvxq,Majeh666,11/26/2021,1,315.0,English is the most commonly taught 2nd language and pretty much anyone born after the 90s that graduated high school can speak English to a decent albeit broken level. And these are everyday people some of whom dont ever interact with the english language except in tv shows and movies.    Talking to anyone that looks older than 40-50 in english is a complete crapshot some might know a word or two picked up from the tv while the others will look at you like youre drunk or possessed.     On eune in 10/10 games the players speak in English or at the very least start speaking in English before degenerating to insulting in their own language aka the classic kurwa jebany ja pierdole etc.

hm7lbsk,Craftingistheway,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,They didnt have to trust him. They have to trust managment and coach because they do now. if they cannot even do that yeah they can rightfully go fuck off elsewhere.

hm77v3f,happygreenturtle,11/26/2021,1,62.0,Be very careful about what guides you follow on YT. When you see somebody with different how to play guides on like 10+ different champions you know their intention is not to teach but to profit. They pump out as much content as they can with no regard for how accurate it actually is.   Theres a few other people like that Ive come across while looking for good guide videos on youtube. Most of them are playing on smurf accounts in Silver/Gold or theyre playing a custom with friends etc. KingStix isnt a trustworthy source of info   Id recommend using leagueofgraphs to search up the most successful Evelynn players and then lolalytics to see what the highest winrate runes and items are. Use that info to draw your own conclusions and experiment with stuff.   If you find that Predator+Zhonyas still works best for you then at least youve created your own playstyle rather than following somebody elses misinfo
hm7ncq4,Elibu,11/26/2021,1,,NO. FFS. He was asked about his opinion about Alphari. And Alphari reached out to him. Thats it.

hm6yoji,Fleeing_Sunlight,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Look your coworkers dont need to know why youre taking a leave of absence other than that it was a personal/medical issue that is significant enough that it requires you to be take time off.  The issue is that it doesnt seem like this was conveyed at all to the teammates who are upset at the situation or that or the general tone of why Upset had to leave was downplayed to them and that the reason why he left was stupid (his wife was lonely?).   Literally he could have just sent a group text to the team during his plane ride back home apologizing and that the issue was significant enough that he has to leave and that probably would have sufficed.
hm7lul3,Ialnej,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Of course it is

hm7n19o,Grand-Garlic,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Right? Why is everyone making this about the community when it’s his teammates he fucked over. People can’t seem to grasp the idea that 4 of his teammates were fucked over in this situation.
hm7a15j,Agreeable_Junket_271,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,lol Im aware of what emergency means. you seem to be unaware of the concept of subjective experience as in what he considers an emergency is subjective to his own worldview.  whether his reasoning for considering it an emergency will hold up under scrutiny is entirely unknown given that literally no one knows what his situation was

hm7029y,CoogiMonster,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,This.  I’ve said it before but you can give a little bit without giving up a lot.  His wife is getting the scapegoat treatment with “she couldn’t handle being alone” and this is all because Upset didn’t get in front of what the emergency is.  It sucks but hopefully it’s a learning moment for people involved that if you don’t control the narrative and defend yourself and those you love it’s possible that others will jump to conclusions.  The damage is done and it’s best to just not respond to these things further.
hm7l3cd,Elibu,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Very doubtful he just left like that.

I personally dont think someone died or is dying because it would be easy to tell and understand his will to leave worlds.
hm81j93,sukableet,11/26/2021,1,277.0,That would be 100k/(32^7) = 0.00000291038 or one in 343597. This is definitely a very rough estimation for the reasons you mentioned and I would argue someone that is taking those into account could put up a much better guess than a purely random one. Anyway it definitely is rare which does make it quite a funny coincidence.
hm7fkjw,GarryTheCarry,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,Because they cant understand that he doesnt know them good enough to tell them something that private  He knows Hyli and trusts him not to go public with it thats why he was ready to tell him and Hyli trusting him and Adam going public just proves that he knows who is his friend and who is just coworker
hm780op,thenicob,11/26/2021,1,83.0,I see what hes implying: the quality of the camera joke edit was way worse than modern cameras are. I also felt like the editing of the video was pretty meh. BDS had much better videos (see the Xico one). sound was really meh in the interview section.
hm73f7a,MCGabbaG,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,I 100% agree. The fact that only Adam feels like he has to vent about this publicly kinda shows for me that he is the least mature of the players. Probably thinks he can say anything he wants now because of the massive French fanbase. Kinda scary tbh.

hm7q9yg,Broken_Reality,11/26/2021,1,4461.0,Would you tell someone you worked with for only a few months the details of a family crisis? Especially if they are immature?

Upset was right not to tell him anything.

hm730r8,GuyOnTheMoon,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,The situation overall is incredibly messy and full of misunderstandings. We as the viewers know nothing about the full story but what we do know is that no one is absolutely in the right on this.   The entire team including Upset put in incredible effort and time to get a spot in Worlds. And to see all that hard work get thrown away on such a short notice must definitely compel some emotions onto anyone. Upset is entitled to his privacy but Adam is also completely entitled to feel the way he felt when words aren’t exchanged for both parties to come to an understanding.  Yes it was unprofessional for Adam to air out how he felt in a twitlonger for the public. But it is also equally unprofessional of Upset to essentially ghost his own team members during thr most important tournament of their whole career.
hm7w6ot,ArrayyLoL,11/26/2021,1,3.0,Most of the times it doesnt matter. What matters is the enemy is dead and he is losing XP and gold every second. It matters only when ur damage carry (wether it is the karma or the ziggs) is behind and enemy has a shutdown.
hm796q7,YeastBender,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,I mean Adam mentioned that in his twitlonger but Upset said it was a straight out lie. So one of the two is lying but we dont know which one.

hm70w9d,mistood,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,This is some underrated information.     And Upset is the only one simp and foolish enough to marry her after 2 months. If hes simp enough to marry this used-up thot after 2 months hes definitley able to give up his worlds run to please his psychotic camwife.     If he had an actual real reason he would share it to his teammates and of course they will understand. They might not be happy but they will understand. But the fact that he keeps hiding under the guise of muh privacy makes me believe that he doesnt have an actual good reason. Just that he needs to satisfy his camgirl wife the same way he proposed to her 2 months after dating.

hm89ylv,_DEKADE_,11/26/2021,1,298.0,Im not saying you are wrong but if it was that simple then there would be 1 server.  The main appeal of 2 servers is language Europe has alot of them. Yes you dint need language to ping but speaking in team chat is useful for setting up plays. The other appeal would be ping having a single server would probably affect some countries way more than others.  Im also pretty sure that merging 2 huge servers is alot harder than most people think which is fair enough not everyone is knowledgeable about that topic especially teens or young adults which are the main demographic for lol.  Imo its fine as it is. If you think you would have more fun in another server then make a new account or pay for a transfer.
hm7d8f5,jaguar317,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,I do agree that hopefully Upset has spoken to Adam behind closed doors. However these statements from Upset  are not directed to Adam anymore. He doesnt mention Adam at all in this post. Its directed to the massive amounts of hate Upset and his family are getting from the floodgates that Adam unleashed. Unfortunately that is the basically irreversible consequence of Adams actions.
hm8clfz,blackrifleenthusiast,11/26/2021,1,165.0,Real question does he have some sort of mental/learning disability? If you play 1500 games a season for 6 seasons you will at least climb to silver no matter how bad you are. I have found that most people “stuck” in this rank are either very young and/or lack any sort of critical thinking skill that this game requires. If you have any modicum of common sense and can use M&K on a very basic level you should be silver at least playing that #of games

hm7yqy6,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,55.0,Correct. In lower elos you can get away with a lot of things. Ex. getting kills on the sidelane youre full clearing to full clearing counter jungling. In high elo laners are a lot more reactive to jungle and making decisions become much more difficult.
hm85p73,blackrifleenthusiast,11/26/2021,1,25.0,That’s how Udyr works. If he is even or ahead against ANY champ (yes any) he will win 1v1 especially if he is tiger stance. Tiger Udyrs damage is actually insane throughout the entire game. With AD bruiser items his DOT will do about 1k damage every 3 autos. This lets him duel the likes of Jax Fiora Yi provided he has a lead.  That being said he is pretty much useless if he’s behind in gold (tiger) and xp (Phoenix). If he’s Phoenix stance he’s a lot easier to duel because usually Udyr players build Phoenix full tank. Either stance has a relative power trough at lvl 6 when duelists unlock powerful ults and Udyr gets nothing. That is his most vulnerable point and when you should look to be fighting
hm7fziz,limeopolis1,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,Fnatic staff judged it and determined not only that he could leave but that hed still be playing for them next year.  If the reasoning was total nonsense surely he wouldnt even be considered to return.

hm7d8k8,cav2010,11/26/2021,1,,Yep. The only peoples that should know is his employer since his employer view this as serious situation and feel like he not going to in right state of mind of to play. The let him leave and side with him for this situation sure his teammates could be piss but to drag him out to public like this is to far. They should really talk one on one with him instead
hm7l6ql,Elibu,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Maybe because you dont need to know everything?
hm7pikn,firechaox,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,He said that the reason he was told (girlfriend is sad) wouldnt be a good enough reason and be doesnt think its what actually happened (as can be implied by him saying until Im told what actually happened). But that until hes told otherwise its what hes going to run with... its exactly what he said... I dont see how you read it differently...

hm7o843,firechaox,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,What hes saying is that what he was told is an unjustified reason (girlfriend is upset) and that until hes told the real reason its what hes going to run with. Real reason could be something super serious happened it doesnt need more details but he wasnt told a thing. Seems like communication is the problem when 3 out of 5 in your team sort of feel like this.
hm8my4p,_HotSoup,11/26/2021,1,,This is just straight up false.  The better way to phrase it would be to say people dont care about NA talent when a roster seems to be thrown together at random without a competent coaching staff behind them and without any guidance or resources put into them. Or when the players are used as a bandaid fix to an already imploding team.   So many people are hyped about EGs roster this year. EG is a team with an extremely competent coaching staff veteran voices and leaders along with 2 young NA players and Vulcan.  If youre going to do it right I care a lot about NA players. Im so tired of people cherry-picking examples of bottom tier orgs with seemingly no idea of how to run a LoL team and using that as the example of NA talent not being good enough or people not actually wanting to watch NA players.
hm6z6an,SevenTailedFox,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,My thoughts exactly. As many others have already said Upset has a right to keep his privacy and Adam has a right to be frustrated/angry with the situation. However its extremely unprofessional of Adam to vent on Twitter like that. He can be mad at Upset all he wants but making shit like this public is absurd and harmful.

hm8auy1,tanezuki,11/26/2021,1,9.0,Juggernauts have around the same defensive stats as tanks and have way higher damage for the price of having less mobility and crow controls. They definetely can build tank items.   Also Yasuo Yone and Irelia builds shieldbow while not being marksmen.   I remember Viego also either builds it or Kraken Slayer if not Divine Sunderer.   I could go on for days about items not being tagged for a class but having champions from that said class being perfectly able to use them.   So a tank item being usable by the closest class there is to tank isnt too fantasist I hope.

hm7v124,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,17.0,In challenger support is probably one of the easiest roles to climb in mainly because you have so much impact on the map without actually having any sort of gold. Supports in general are less mechanically skilled so it definitely something I would agree with Dopa on.      When it comes to climbing support for me had the least amount of agency. Being a support that is significantly better than everyone else in the game is not going to have as much of an impact when comparing it to any other role. The support role at the end of the day still plays its part as a side character that supports someone else to carry the game. Top island role ad often dictated by support and jungle mid dictated by jungle and jungle can play freely in lower ranks.
hm7m1kq,FaeeLOL,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,If he doesnt want to tell that is his choice. But that choice comes with the negatives of speculation. Also Adam complained about not knowing the reason. I cant believe I have to say this but *he would not be complaining about not knowing the reason if he was given the reason*.  Your job and a 5-man incredibly hard-working team environment are entirely different things. Cant even be compared. Im not sure if you realize it but we are not just talking about taking a day off from work here. Surely you understand how fucking ridiculously different the situations are so please just stop trying to draw that comparison.

hm8dekz,FakeBukowski,11/26/2021,1,165.0,I feel like a lot of people dont know how to auto attack. If you AA using right click on the target you are not doing it right. In my opinion the best way to auto attack is using attack move on smartcast (some people just use standard attack move though without the smartcast - I wanna say its just personal preference but it really is not you save yourself an extra click every single attack if you use the smartcast version).   It takes some time to get used to but it **will** make you better at auto attacking especially on ranged champions. If anybody is not familiar with this feel free to hit me up for further explanation as I was right clicking people for years before my eyes were opened.
hm7t39g,Silentsht5,11/26/2021,1,120.0,Unrelated to Talon but could someone also look at Seraphines Q skill. Since preseason there is 1 or 2 bugs with it. It either has to do with her enhanced Qs second wave only applying damage to the first target it hits and/or the Q itself not dealing damage at all if i lose vision of the target before the spell lands on the ground. It happened to me like 10 times in 2 games while wave clearing.
hm854mi,Copiz,11/26/2021,1,4.0,Yup! He was looking solid in amateur so I wouldnt be surprised if he gets a team. Hes definitely at least a year away from being LCS ready though.

hm76j16,kazuyaminegishi,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Upset stated that when asked what he thought about Alphari vs Adam he said he felt Alphari was the better player. He also went on to elaborate by saying he feels its normal to try and build the best team possible.  He doesnt owe Adam anything other than an apology for ruining their worlds which I hope he did give them. Anything after that is assigning some debt to Upset that he doesnt have.

hm7g9tv,Fishpuncommenter,11/26/2021,1,28.0,What? Stop making assumptions off of a text post. This is a reasonable request. Auto filling in jungle when you’re unfamiliar isn’t a pleasant experience especially when you’re against a jungle main especially against a jungle main OTP nidalee. His post is clear enough that his expectations of an adc main jungler aren’t high and that it’s the matchmaking’s issues.  Though I don’t know how the balance team fits into this lmao
hm7we28,NotAnAce69,11/26/2021,1,156.0,I found a couple of Youtubers (most Saber) that really taught me a lot of things but a lot of it just came down to making sure that everything that you did had a purpose. Does shoving this wave has a purpose? If Im stuck sitting around waiting for the wave what can I do in the meantime? Establish vision steal my junglers raptors maybe set up a kill bush with my support? Which side of the map should I be setting up shop on depending on whether or not its baron or dragon spawning next?  Just whatever you do DO NOT RAGE. In fact for the purposes of improvement (people are going to hate this) dont ever surrender. The game might be lost you might be the only eukaryotic organism on the map but learning how to play from behind and how to flip a game on its head with that one big risky move will in the short term win you a couple of improbable victories and in the long term allow you to improve (especially in bronze people throw all the time because they 4fun fountain dive only to lost a 40 minute slugfest). A person is never going to improve by winning the easy games and giving up the hard ones.  Just whatever you do DO NOT RAGE.

hm7z8ir,vegeful,11/26/2021,1,1589.0,Yes that normal. But what not normal is that when u fk up your team the least u could do is be silent and not hurting your teammate feeling more. What Nisqy crying and Adam feeling not matter after u screw them? There is not an ounce of guilt from it. I too feel offend if i was treat like Shit.   The tweet only happen because of this. If the tweet hallen because Upset leaving Adam will post it during world considering redditor saying how immature he is.     Tldr: Upset recent action had cause and effect. The effect is this.
hm8r8wm,De-Lit,11/26/2021,1,8.0,If you plan on getting in to the game and playing more than just a little while the arcane fad then go for the most expensive on for your free champion.

hm77u0m,BokoBors,11/26/2021,1,51.0,Im pretty sure no matter how bugged/strong a champ is it wouldnt matter but bugs are bugs and theyre super annoying + easily fixable its just super annoying someone trying to enjoy their champion but a bug happens and they die/dont get a kill because of it. Think of it this way:  Put yourself in his shoes how would you feel if your champion was bugged for straight up 5 years ?XD     EDIT:What does champion balance have to do with this anyway.. the guy is simply stating the champions bugs hes not complaining/stating how weak/broken Talon is
hm7fhs2,Vangorf,11/26/2021,1,,Well one could argue Adam has a looooooooooooooooooong way ahead of him plenty of scaling meanwhile Alphari is a known quantity. Its like how FNC gave prio to Bwipo instead of Soaz after Bwipo had to sub in cuz Soaz broke his hand (iirc but only 99% sure on the reason he had to be put on the bench).  It would be totally sensible for FNC to stick with a very very promising young rookie. Look what happened with Bwipo and Caps. Especially after all this shit they put him through (you cant deny that either Upset or FNC management gigafucked up the communication initially). Having some discretion and good will towards your promising rookie after such an incident is the bare minimum imo.
hm7fwrr,I_am_not_Serabia,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,Or 3/5 of the team got angry enough and decided they are done with this shit and keepng upset was the best option or fnc would have to rebuild the whole team entirely.

hm7cx0j,Dark-Dragon,11/26/2021,1,3.0,ADCs are decent now crit is the way to go for most of them. Drakes provide small buffs depending on their element and if your team gets 4 you get a much stronger buff also based on the element. The map also changes after two dragons have been slain the version of the map you get depends on which dragon type spawns as the 3rd dragon it will always be a different dragon than the first two and all dragon spawns from 3 on will have the same type until a single team gets 4. You can hover over the dragon icons in the scoreboard to find out what they do. There are now mythic items theyre supposed to be even more powerful than other fully evolved items. You can only get one mythic item although in a super late game situation where money isnt an issue you can switch mythic items. Apart from being extra strong they all have their own mythic passive which is another bonus you get for each other item you complete so at best you get this bonus 5 times if you want to walk around without boots. There are now objective bounties theyre still very new so expect balance changes to come (probably). Their idea is that the team who is behind can take a marked objective which could be a turret or a neutral objective and if they manage to do so theyre rewarded with bonus team gold.
hm6z4so,Seneido,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,i mean is there any doubt that his decision tainted the career for multiple players? i would never say he did it on purpose to fuck them over but do you think a team that goes to semis and has a successfull year would implode like this?

hm8jc60,FatPigsExtreme,11/26/2021,1,174.0,One of my friends was stuck in bronze 4/5 for 4 years. One day one of of my other friends (who is a diamond master yi main) started teaching him how to play master yi. He started climbing pretty quickly and eventually hit gold. This made me realise that improvement is possible for people stuck in very low elo for a long time but they often don’t care/can’t be bothered to put in the effort.

hm6y6jh,BurningApe,11/26/2021,1,28.0,Translating the lyrics was odd but you explained at the end this is some diehard fan emo stuff haha. I understand that its gonna be the end of FPX but idunno if it warrants this big of a deal (especially from a fan perspective). Im sure theres gonna be some emotional turmoil especially from Crisp side as he was personally on the team of tightly-knit friends but I mean in reality nothing is over right they will continue to work towards a better future. This exact same thing has probably happened to so many other teams so many other players.  Maybe this is just cultural difference:  1. I understand why he is emotional  2. Dont understand why he needs to share it so much people go through this all the time yes even in a commoners life. I think this is the reason why I can never be a diehard fan we all have the people close to us in our lives and lonely people who require more attention yet here we are in this day and age always chasing after stars who get enough care and love as it is. This is no jab at Crisp but just in general at how idol culture even in America.  3. Dont understand why fans are so emotional but Ive never been a diehard fan so who am I to judge -> this is just me being an ass       That said I fully respect the fan culture and Crisp expressing his sentiments. Thanks for translating everything!
hm8c936,Kreemoswiggidy,11/26/2021,1,210.0,League trolling with this kind up update they remove statik so they can put statik on all team and that QuimtechAllies bullshit
hm7ijew,nyasiaa,11/26/2021,1,130.0,I used to think that so I made it a super deep habit to look at minimap and I can do that in a way that doesnt hinder my normal play at all  now I will never miss anyone missing ever I mute everyones pings and I can probably see that someone is missing on any lane possibly before the laners themselves realise that and ping that   if I have a deep ward I can see any gank way in advance 100% of the time   The problem is that.. its not really helpful. Most of the time the jungler is missing so what play super mega safe all the time? Im just gonna achieve nothing because of that. I see them bot lane that still doesnt give me anything. I need to know how much exactly it takes for them to get from bot lane to top lane because every single wave manipulation decision depends on that. And I dont know that because I dont know what camps they will take along the way I dont know how fast this champion clears what camps are already cleared based on the timing of the gank. If my deep ward gets cleared Im basically as good as if I didnt ever look at the minimap. Often I see a jungler from far away I think they wont be able to gank me and suddenly it turns out that they just pop predator flash ult whatever stun and I still die. Often I think that even if they gank me Im still safe. Nope didnt expect items and runes to deal way too much damage. Or maybe they are coming my lane what now? nothing my lane is fucked anyways because I was building a slow push into enemy because I didnt predict the pathing of the jungler and I didnt even think about it being a possibility. Instead of making less errors Im making different errors.    Learning to use the minimap has only shown me how much I suck at the game dunning kruger at its fullest I guess
hm80mb8,TH3RM4L33,11/26/2021,1,134.0,Youre right. I edited in some of the ideas I could think of.

hm7c0kx,Azashiro,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,Thats bullshit. All you are doing in that case is changing your tune when its convenient to you to do so. When you need to win practice and improve its all about family this teammates that and how you trust each other but when it comes down to it things get rough and you have to treat your teammates with appropriate respect you leave them in the dark? Fuck that. You dont get to weasel out with we are just co-workers.

Yes legally speaking Id only need to give an explanation to my direct manager but for an environment like a league team where presumably each member has a say in personell decisions Id probably be pushed out.  Hell if Nisqy and Adam were the stars and Upset the role player thats exactly what would have happened. They would have pushed him out.

hm7hqoi,RandomGuy928,11/26/2021,1,120.0,This is such nonsense. Without replays I would conclude that the only thing I can ever do in any game is hide under my turret because any interaction with enemy champions results in them having better mechanics than me and me dying.

hm7ff5j,BusinessCashew,11/26/2021,1,,Its also not the same situation because in a day job youre also generally dealing with adults that have a bit of life experience and have far better impulse control than a bunch of dudes in their late teens and early 20s who havent finished developing their brains yet.

hm8mzmb,tanezuki,11/26/2021,1,,Also as I searched up for it you might see in it another comment but **94%** of the divers the squisher bruiser subclass can use Thornmail while the Juggernauts the tankier bruiser subclass has only **64%** of its members able to use Thornmail.  Dont you see the issue ? The tankier classes cannot utilize a tank item compared to the squishies. Makes no sense.

hm77o5p,SP3EDI,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,dont tell lies. he never tried to replace anyone. Thats bullshit the french idiots want you to believe on social media like it was a top 10 anime betrayal. Perkz and Alphari where comming back as duo to EU and basically all top Teams where offered the duo so was fnatic and fnatic/alpahri contacted upset (alpharis old teammate) to talk to him about the stuff. Nothing out of the odinary and the very basic between every player move in the fucking league. Nisqy wanted out himself he wanted to go to c9 but c9 bailed out and no one else wants nisqy. Fnatic chose to upgrade mid with humanoid and again no one with a brain would not pick humanoid over nisqy. It has absolutly nothing to do with upset.

hm7fvsj,Poughy14,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,I dont get it when you play sport / eSport at a competitive level you share a bond with your teammates I dont understand why a grow up man cant take 5 min to talk to his teammates before leave the biggest competition of the year.   Its courtesy at least.   I had a coworker (so not even close as a teammate) lose his father right before one of the most important meeting for a company. Of coure we let the guy go. Just act as grown up.  I think its more shady from upset side.   None the less the harassing from the community is terrible
hm8kv2e,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,140.0,kayn takes an entire team to play against since he has such good terrain scaling (q and e both give him insane mobility). he can also go bruiser assassin and tank. Only real way to play against him is to not let him get form and take objectives early something soloq cannot allow.
hm7lvzh,iamcherry,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,People comparing their day jobs to pro players is fucking astounding. Upset leaving literally devalued Adam’s entire career and he will definitively be worth less as a player because of his teams world’s performance.   Whether you feel Adam is deserved an explanation is on you but Upset probably lost Adam somewhere between 100k and millions of dollars over the lifespan of his career.  On top of that people don’t really seem to realize these players are being paid in part to have less privacy than the average person.
hm78z77,Agreeable_Junket_271,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,since your argument seems to be predicated on this false assumption yes family emergency can mean something minor. and obviously some fnc members seem to believe that to be the case in this instance.   I hate bringing up rumors but you dont seem to be understanding. Ill give a purely hypothetical example generated from these rumors: Assume Upsets wife got lonely and was on the verge of breaking up with him. Well he values his relationship more than the game so he goes to his wife to save their marriage. To him this is justified and urgent. But a third party observer may instead see a rash young adult year old making poor life decisions chasing a much older 2-time divorcee whom he married within 2 months.  As we can see differing worldviews changes what you view as constituting a family emergency.  HOW CAN THIS ALL BE RESOLVED? By explaining your dire situation in terms of something that is UNIVERSALLY UNDERSTOOD to be a justified reason for leaving. In my example in the previous comment a medical emergency is a universally understood solid reason.  As this example illustrates the qualifier family emergency is not and there exist examples of situations falling under this umbrella where two different parties disagree on what constitutes a justifiable cause for leaving.

hm71fyv,Kataleps,11/26/2021,1,108.0,While I see what you mean that doesnt happen every game and if your boy is as good as they say they are they should be able to win games where THEIR bot lane is 0/0/0 or even 10/0/0. Guaranteed hes throwing games in those states but hyperfocusing on the games where his bot lane is 2/20  Also its bronze. Chances are a 20/2 bot lane is going to find a way to throw that lead and if you play smart you can cash in when they inevitably do.  Im nothing special G2 with 60 games but Bronze players will literally hand you gold if you play with a BASIC gameplan.
hm7peul,GunnyTheKid,11/26/2021,1,5.0,It is called roaming it can be the determining factor in if your teams wins (if done properly) or loses (if done improperly). They shouldnt be doing it during important interactions like fighting over cannon minions but say you shove the wave and force both enemy bot laners to back it is good for the support to roam at that point so the ADC is the sole recipient of turret plate gold and the sup can act as a secondary jungler to gank. If you see your support is in mid lane at a bad time for whatever reason dont go in just fall back under turret and ping them for assistance

hm75c2k,mistood,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Its not confirmed to be the reason that he left but his last words to the team. There is a difference and Upset is twisting the words to accuse Adam of saying that was the reason. But Adam simply says that were his last words.

hm7nhku,SituationGood922,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,yes the trust goes both ways. people are saying that obviously Upset cant trust 20 year olds hes only known for half a year well the same is true in reverse? how can his topside trust that this 20 year old theyve only known for half a year has left for a reason they would sympathize with?  the argument is that of course Upset left for a good reason out of his control worlds is his dream! no it could be some scandal with his wife especially given her history. it could be that Upsets fifth cousin is in the hospital. it could be that Upset himself fucked up a signature on their home lease and he needs to go back or theyll be evicted.  if Upset considers these things to warrant his return thats his choice. but I can totally see why Bwipo and Adam and Nisqy might not view Upset as the poor unfortunate guy in these three scenarios. I dont mean to speculate but some people legitimately cannot fathom that there are controversial scenarios.

hm7xd9a,Ray_ADC,11/26/2021,1,,No its not support as a whole is literally easier than mid for example.   So obviously getting to X rank with support would be easier since the  relative skill that you need is lower.  As for what this guy is saying the guy with the highest WR on that soloq challenge earlier this year was a support player so Id say hes just bad.

hm75f5a,matteosagwa,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,That is totally normal Alphari is better than Adam. Alphari came to Upset and asked about joining fnatic as Upset has played with Alphari before and they are friends.   Roster changes happen all the time hell Jankos wanted Rekkles out of G2 nothing wrong with that. And Upset didnt want Adam out of fnatic he just thought Alphari was a better choice for the team...because he is.

hm8p55p,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,165.0,Ive heard that phrase a lot. Support is definitely has the biggest skill difference relative to the game average but I dont think anyone could just swap and expect to climb.
hm7k0x9,computo2000,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,> the community is fine to think he’s being a weasel for not telling them  Thats the most dumb take imo. Something awful happened i gotta go What happened I cant tell you because I dont want this info on social media youre lying lmao  Have you ever learned when an argument is properly supported? Because this isnt it. This is one problem. A second problem is if Upset was a liar why didnt he lie about the reason he is leaving?  Like Upset an elite level player after having reached worlds and having played the game for years and having never suddenly left his team had to leave his team because of a traumatic family event and he was extremely selective about sharing its nature because he doesnt want people on social media to use it against him. Why not believe this? Where is the logical inconsistency? That nisqy/adam dont buy it? Well how about they come out with ARGUMENTS to support their opinions I dont give a shit what they think if they dont properly support it and neither should you.

hm7327o,mistood,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Upset meets a camgirl/onlyfans girls who lives in South America online dates her for 2 months and decides to marry her. This is her 3rd marriage and she even has nudes available online. You can tell from her social media that she has many red flags.        Upset makes the judgement to commit to this used-up cam thot marrying her after only 2 months of dating. You think he is someone who makes smart and sensible decisions?
hm7r40e,Bluehorazon,11/26/2021,1,203.0,I mean you could likely play a fasting Viktor or Singed the question though is are they the supports or Senna?
hm7jzzn,EfficientAstronaut1,11/26/2021,1,97.0,Viper is the world champion ADC
hm7qxy6,akutasame94,11/26/2021,1,144.0,I am the exact same opposite rofl  Ive played with high elo and low elo. I have beat challengers numerous times in lane (Mix of friends with different skill levels so we made custom 5 v 5s).  In season 8 I decided to try and take the game seriously like literally pay attention to everything. I climbed to plat 1 in very few wins from Gold 4. I think I lost only 3 games on that climb. But then I got bored of playing same champions and holding myself back.  See I am pretty good in lane mechanically. I used to play a lot of FPS games and I am used to fast paced gameplay and needing quick reflexes so I am greeding and disrespecting everything enemy does rofl. I am like If jungler comes to my ass overextending for last 5 minutes Ill kill em both and since this is not fps I die. I also dont ward. I know I should I know where and when I just dont care.  I also cycle through champions constantly. THe only role I actually dont do that is ADC which is my main role that I dont play too much and have only started playing again to climb because  in other roles the urge to outplay is too strong.   The main difference tho is I dont really complain or care. I probably could reach diamond maybe higher or maybe Id be stuck in plat but I play the game to have fun and couldnt care less where I am ranked.
hm7jr2c,kochukaru,11/26/2021,1,,But you are speculating that they didnt get on a team specifically because of the buyout which is not the case for some or most of them.. lol
hm7ev5o,whydoyoureadnames,11/26/2021,1,97.0,Gamergate is funny in the moment to moment understanding and play by play but as you said the long term effects it had were devastating. Steve bannon even directly cited gamergate when he began his political moves. It’s so fucked.
hm8b72r,Coltz,11/26/2021,1,9.0,There’s a problem in that there is no way so far it seems to make your rating reflect your actual in game performance. Which means people can have power to grief by taking 4 teammate down with them and everyone loses mmr as if nothing bad happened when the intentional feeder should take the LP hit more than anyone else.
hm7pekj,thehazardball,11/26/2021,1,89.0,I read the first and last part and thought Hans was signing with EG all of a sudden
hm8racz,studiousAmbrose,11/26/2021,1,165.0,Oh thats really interesting actually. Maybe youre just too good. :) Still wild that even years later Bjergsens realm still is acknowledged lol.
hm7isxz,HyBrideh,11/26/2021,1,5.0,If you manage to get ahead early try to transition that lead into the map. What I mean by that is to try to gank the other lanes and help your jungler secure vision and objectives. I think this is what most low elo players struggle with they always say they win their lane but lose the game and that’s because they don’t transition their lane lead into a map lead. Secure objectives and vision with your lead as well as advantages in kills and prio for your team and you’ll consistently win more games.

hm6zzi4,lemonrabbits,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,So youre telling me if Adam went to Upset and straight up said Hey if you dont tell me about your family emergency I will make a twitlonger about your situation you think Upset is going to all of a sudden tell Adam and trust him? Ofc not.   Imagine wanting to tell someone something super confidential and private because if you dont they will write a twitlonger about you.
hm8owd4,doglop,11/26/2021,1,8.0,I read it fully both the in game and outised novel. The fact that maokai kalista and hecarim arent even mentioned is the lesser of all the shit problems the story had is incredible
hm6z6zx,Cereaza,11/26/2021,1,83.0,So is the LFL just going super hard this year on spend and trying to become a major region in their own right or wtf is happening in Europe!?

hm86tjl,AlHorfordHighlights,11/26/2021,1,92.0,this is pure cope lol support is the easiest role and it isnt close  its definitely hard to play enchanters at high elo but champions like leona and blitz are horribly broken at any elo theyre ridiculously simple and punish mistakes hard
hm8f266,ChampionshipSecure65,11/26/2021,1,2.0,season 4?
hm71qyj,Rektile7,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Surely there is a decently acceptable run down of events without invading the privacy of the party affected that could be told to the 4 guys who got you to your first worlds? I wouldnt leave the team in the dark nor would i then go to management and talk about replacing 2 dudes who had amazing splits.
hm7kgza,LakersLAQ,11/26/2021,1,,It was 3 years.
hm8a6vx,Brad3196,11/26/2021,1,2.0,Will do thanks!!
hm8k85o,kyubincel,11/26/2021,1,572.0,Like DireKoala said. If you want a better understanding of the world you can do so by playing Legends of Runeterra their voicelines flavor text and art really add a lot to worldbuilding. If you want a closer experience to league PC go for Wild Rift. And if you want some actual story then play Ruined King or read the comics of Lux/Ashe/Zed.
hm7kpo4,Rikkimaaruu,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Thats realy strange.  If iam in a foregin country i try to learn a few key words and stuff and if that dosent work its english.  But damn i would never dare to order something in german when iam in a shop in portugal.
hm7mu6m,Zagan_baal,11/26/2021,1,45.0,Wookie?
hm7vefr,NightDhampir,11/26/2021,1,10.0,Some of us play aram because they love to play League but cannot bring themselves to play SR after receiving a phone call that their one and only brother had been killed while playing ranked. You know PTSD but fuck me for being a filthy casual amirite?
hm71v4c,KvotheM,11/26/2021,1,42.0,If someone left their team to be with their girlfriend of 2/3 months the teammates would probably want an explanation. Just because they got married for visa reasons doesnt really change that. The backlash has been kept at bay because people thought it was a family member passing away and now months later it is coming out that wasnt the case.   The whole relationship gives off really bad vibes (6-7 years older 2 divorces at 27 former sex worker/cam girl) and the reason is very likely not good enough to justify his actions.
hm8a5jp,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,108.0,When youre a midlaner that roleswaps to support you feel like a 8th grader at an elementary school. You can easily trade on enemy bot laners. You can help your ad wave manage and prevent being ganked for the most part. Being a support you know what your sidelaners need. Teamfighting is basically the same as you just either support your DPS or you engage which might be the only skill that really isnt found in midlane all that often.
hm7iopv,ApplePitou,11/26/2021,1,6.0,I recommend Khazix vs Udyr :3
hm7wmnx,Xalloog,11/26/2021,1,130.0,Neither does yours so stop acting otherwise
hm759xw,jaguar317,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Well I certainly wouldnt want to be a significant other or relative of yours who was going through a tough personal struggle knowing that you would tell people who have nothing to do with me about my struggle. But of course you never know how you would really act unless you were actually put in that situation. You may be surprised at the choices youd make.

hm7ekc9,fullyuncooly,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,and Hyli acted like an adult and didnt try to ask for more details when he noticed that Upset didnt want to share them. the emotional maturity of leguas fanbase is that of a toddler
hm8ezah,RyswickRyswick,11/26/2021,1,118.0,I cant even fathom the amount of mental gymnastics youd need to perform to believe that EUW Diamond players could even hold a candle to NA Challenger players.  Its not even remotely close. The skill difference from iron to diamond isnt even as large as it is from diamond to challenger.
hm7dez9,Grothas,11/26/2021,1,,Completely agree.

hm7jty7,LakersLAQ,11/26/2021,1,63.0,Exactly one bad split/year and they are making a lot less for the next year.
hm7yd83,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,55.0,The best move is to always fill once you get into select and pick normal roles for queueing.    If you could play all roles at an equally skilled level you should NOT queue for fill. Fill will only get you into game faster. You should queue the most popular role / role you think has the worst performer and fill the role that someone gets autofilled in (since someone on the enemy team will also likely have an autofill).   For me personally I am most comfortable playing mid > supp > ad > jg > top but would happily fill if someone was autofilled in my select.
hm8q9hv,morde_x_aatrox_lemon,11/26/2021,1,8.0,these all sound like complaints i had when i was really new just keep playing the game cuz none of this is really true actually  not only is getting counterpicked every game statistically improbable but toplane can be extremely impactful if you snowball lane correctly
hm7mk99,m4ryo0,11/26/2021,1,63.0,Multi year contract get the players that big bag that they want.If they dont sign a multi year contractthey get a way smaller salary.
hm72045,SkeletonJakk,11/26/2021,1,24.0,Buying health against maxhp true damage is completely pointless what?  there is *NOTHING* you can build against it.  Against % phys or mag just buy resists lol.
hm6zgxs,Puzzled_Helicopter83,11/26/2021,1,4.0,&#x200B  >Increase the minimum level before ranked  Thats just going to encourage account buying and it would also give an advantage to people who pay for xp boost.
hm72lv0,Obrejiklea,11/26/2021,1,13.0,yea a sweeper definitely screws you over especially since you can only place one ward per game
hm88itu,Night6SrKn,11/26/2021,1,106.0,He’s not very good he’s literally the best. I role swapped from top to jg this season watching Malice exclusively. Went from d4 jg to 300 lp jg.
hm7nu5p,Consistent_Mammoth,11/26/2021,1,19.0,> Also its not like I dont know about wave management  Obviously you dont. Some brain dead jungler pushing your lane halfway to the enemy tower is worse than them just running it down and giving over a kill because no you either cant farm or have to risk dying multiple times to fix it.
hm8icvg,chinomaster182,11/26/2021,1,118.0,Its always the same after a bad split NA teams are going to heavily discount them. Happens all the time.

hm7tvoq,murp0787,11/26/2021,1,124.0,People arent entitled but usually its the kind thing to do especially in that situation.  Especially when all thats been given is some vague bullshit feeling reason. He completely fucked his team after 1 year of playing to get to the most important event there is the night before it started. If I was on his team Id be pissed also if I was given some vague reason with no clarity.
hm7afc0,Riot_Koyuncu,11/26/2021,1,55.0,Thanks for the comprehensive list - Ill take a look at these
hm7invl,comso20,11/26/2021,1,,this is such a terrible opinion for so many reasons i dont know where to start. idk why you see relationships as some manipulative game where you can win or lose but i hope you either grow out of it as you grow up or seek help because thats not a healthy mindset to have.

hm8p19l,V1pArzZ,11/26/2021,1,24.0,Yeah and lillia is a slayer like yone yasuo and master yi. Riot classifications dont say much. A juggernaut is a low cc high damage tank. Tk has his R for cc and a stun on q once in a while. Not much more than darius or nasus. He also deals a metric shit ton of damage.

hm7ie9s,Devenityy,11/26/2021,1,74.0,It was a family member passing or seriously ill. Kind of obvious from Upset & Dardo’s statements today.

hm8a311,AshesOntheFire778,11/26/2021,1,51.0,U have to target nasus adc. Zed is meant to kill squishes. U can kill tanky characters but for Nasus his dmg is too much for u to handle
hm6xy6x,zNYNz,11/26/2021,1,15.0,and the topic at hand and my original comments were about the way ARAM is balance and it is not balanced for any particular mmr.  It is balanced for all the players that play LB for any given mmr.

hm71rn2,mistood,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,People need to understand context like this. When they understand who Upset and his wife are it will help them make better judgements of this controversy.
hm73moo,jaguar317,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,I agree that you should be as transparent about yourself as possible but the issue here is that its not Upsets private information he would be sharing but someone elses. If for example someone you were close to was sexually assaulted. Would you really tell a coworker who youve known for 6 months who you see as an immature 19 year old kid about the specific details of the situation? How would the person who was sexually assaulted feel if you were spreading this information to people who have nothing to do with them?  Also youre putting the blame on Upset for defending himself when Adam was the one who escalated the situation sending massive amounts of hate towards upset when it had already been dying down. I dont agree with this at all.
hm7mhrh,nTzT,11/26/2021,1,310.0,My teammates never grow up not realistic
hm7xden,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,55.0,I think I could hit challenger on all roles given enough games (Im sure if I played 2000 on each role I would definitely hit challenger at least once (tyler1)) . I think the better answer would be giving which ones I think I could get the easiest.      support > ad > jg > top
hm72stw,mogadichu,11/26/2021,1,23.0,And?
hm8540i,xanat9,11/26/2021,1,6.0,Corina hasnt tho and the support is still from Zaun she may simply be from another timeline and they dont want to mess them up
hm82m4r,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,55.0,I havent been playing mid too much but I the meta is relatively the same. I think viktor is shattered with first strike and any control mage thats taking that + futures market. I could be completely wrong though.
hm83796,LakersLAQ,11/26/2021,1,,Thats not the point though. They were using both last year with Jiizuke and Ignar and he makes it a possibility for future moves. His salary isnt going to go down just because EG decides not to use an import slot one year.
hm7u2yv,IAmDaleicious,11/26/2021,1,105.0,Who knows. I’m not too confident on the top side for either DK or T1. Could be a three-headed race for playoffs.
hm8l361,TuringPerfect,11/26/2021,1,140.0,I would guess at the highest levels its all those responsibilities and sup.
hm8jgkh,rjaydo2,11/26/2021,1,21.0,This is definitely prevalent in the lower elos (low diamond and below) but once you get to d2+ theres a very very small chance the game comes back. I think this is what the last commenter was trying to say. Once youre in a higher elo bracket its probably because you make sure you win your games that youre 20 kills ahead. Its not ALL of the time but nothing is worse than exerting yourself for 30 mins in a 3-4 hour session on a game you never had a chance in because the lane you strong-sided lost along with the others. Playing that out past even plat just feels extremely bad. Theres times where the game is truly 90% chance of being over.
hm8kiau,lp_phnx327,11/26/2021,1,4.0,I feel like this is not the first time an LCS caster has made this joke (and that the first time involved a Graves as well).
hm7utbd,Scribblord,11/26/2021,1,5.0,Well if they roam there’s not much you can do about it   Less kills on lane but more exp  As long as your support doesn’t feed or grief you they’re better than average from my experience
hm73q83,DragonApps,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,If Bwipo Nisqy and Adam are all against Upset there is not a single reason to believe that Upset communicated properly.
hm7ka4u,Random_Stealth_Ward,11/26/2021,1,540.0,Yeah this is why renekand nasus ult sand was nerfed so it didnt affect low end hardware
hm7fmvn,Le_Zoru,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,Je sais pas si t es francophone natif but you highly reinterpreted his tweets. The way you translate it it looks like kameto is blaming upset while hes just having fun of he and Bwipo saying he find it a lot of fun from upset to go home to see his babe and kind of ridiculous to pre lock your girlfriends main every single game (tho not in a harmful way more like bro thats funny but drop it way). Also he was originaly answering to someone saying True man will leave worlds for his girl. It was absolutely not a serious conversation.
hm70fiw,lolzomg123,11/26/2021,1,141.0,Something about Shakespeare infinite time and monkeys then.
hm7nspj,vegeful,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,True if 3 out of 4 people were in to understand it i will just say that Adam just lack of understanding. But when its over 50% of your team dont even know wtf happening then its scream that the management has fail to give info.
hm7pflw,phranq,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,They aren’t inciting anything. He gave his side of the story. One side is willing to share and one side isn’t. That’s the price Upset is paying for not wanting to share with his teammates why he left them.
hm74xbs,whydoyoureadnames,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,And they got told he had a family emergency. What is there not to get here? There isn’t much more to be done other than go into a specifics which he is not entitled too.

hm7r69e,Reshaos,11/26/2021,1,90.0,Is he using predator on Eve in a challenger level match though? Thats the big difference. You stick a challenger player in Gold elo and he could make conqueror runes work on Eve...  If your skill level is Plat and youre playing in Plat then you need to be using the right runes since you cannot afford to handicap yourself.
hm865d7,Rengar_Is_Good_kitty,11/26/2021,1,159.0,Youre lucky that these bugs are easily reproducible should be somewhat easy for Riot to fix.  Rengars bugs are mostly random and he has far more bugs than Talon sucks playing Rengar when hes so incredibly bugged cant go a single game without something stupid happening only way to fix Rengar is to rewrite his code.
hm7zwcz,DerpMason,11/26/2021,1,156.0,The biggest thing that helped me improve was just telling myself “I can’t change how other people play in my games so I should exclusively focus on what I can do better.”
hm8kqy9,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,140.0,I would want to go pro but academy gotta come first before lcs
hm8j4de,Arclight_Ashe,11/26/2021,1,315.0,You know you’ve pissed someone off when they go from trying to insult you in broken English to outright capslocking in their native language and expecting you to understand them.   Bonus points when you respond ‘speak English it’s English language server’ and you get 5 lines of ‘fuck your mother’ in Turkish or polish and the comment that started it off was ‘can you please ping miss’
hm7ci8a,CodeMonkeyChico,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,Yeah its not like any of his teammates are newer or prone to leaking details and posting objectively incorrect and ridiculous twitlongers. Crazy of him not to reveal intimate traumatic details of his wifes life to each of them individually.
hm6ytyt,Broken_Reality,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,No they dont deserve anything more than has already been given. Especially as it would just be spread about by the likes of Adam and Upsets private life would then be ripped apart by all those who are already doing what they are on twitter and reddit.
hm84sel,Oribeau,11/26/2021,1,12.0,bro its 100% him cmon

hm764rl,InsuranceOne2864,11/26/2021,1,1001.0, looks weird but i dont think its too much of a big deal. They might have just wanted to release some stress and what better way than their favorite thing to do?
hm7tk8r,SecondSoulless,11/26/2021,1,17.0,No problem bro. It can be easy for your friends to tilt and throw but the second you call them out for that being an asshole thing to do it typically turns things around. Hope you have some fun games!

hm76i0l,xiyeonah,11/26/2021,1,188.0,TF Blade believe it or not when he first started streaming obviously didnt have the same ego he has now. He was legitimately the most skilled prospect when he was hitting rank 1 with garbage champions like Irelia and Akali pre-rework. I think he got too carried away with his global rank 1 challenge and just lost any professional aspirations. Maybe now he seems toxic in a team environment but maybe if he started with no ego he could have turned out different.   Right now there is  Sniper who is a young prospect that could probably keep streaming rather than go pro as well. Its just that because NA streaming is so lucrative that its not as appealing to become a professional. Streaming is a much more comfortable lifestyle so if NA truly doesnt have a chance to win Worlds then I could see why prospects turn away from professional play and build their brand. Like Blade is definitely making way more money right now with his Twitch and Youtube than he would be competing in the LCS unless he literally became the best top in NA.
hm87ub0,zUkUu,11/26/2021,1,5.0,Chainsword is super good after the buffs months ago. Its like 104% cost efficent WITHOUT the effect now and gives you all stats you want as bruiser. Its super cheap too allowing you to build it MINUTES earlier before other get to their second item.  I frequently build Divine Sunderer Chempunk Steraks in that order and its one of the most consistent core items you can have.
hm8q8eg,doglop,11/26/2021,1,4.0,Eh I like wildrift but I dont like not being able to get skins even if they are random and the worst of all in pc at least thats something I like
hm7y2gp,RisTheGod,11/26/2021,1,,Bwipos last time he played as a top laner was worst than Impact imo
hm7qrrw,usernameisavailable2,11/26/2021,1,148.0,I think the best usage of this is when youre playing morgana against say a blitz. With self cast you can hover ur mouse over ur ally and should the blitz hook come flying towards you you dont have to reposition ur mouse back to yourself before casting black shield.
hm741xm,Hrkeol,11/26/2021,1,42.0,He literally said he had tow meetings with the mangment in the 2 weeks before he left to tell them about the situation and what he is going through. You really think he will have 2 meeting with the management to tell them he think his wife is cheating on him? This whole cheating thing is a pity speculations that have no basis so eathier post some evidence or just get outta my face with that.

hm7a6zp,gridemann,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,Exactly if anything all of these shallow non-answers are validating Adams version even more.  Reddit is truly something else.
hm75n6n,PowerfulRice5704,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Upset is under no obligation to tell his teammates the specifics of the situation. Them knowing his mother died or his wife miscarrying or whatever it might be doesnt change the situation of the matter. Upset placed his family above his playing a video game and that is a decision I will always support and we should all respect his privacy. Bwipow cheating on his gf or however he hurt her and airing his dirty laundry to the public was his own decision. Adam being annoyed at not knowing the situation is a feeling he is entitled to. Upsets situation is still none of their business.

hm75345,AdamovitsM,11/26/2021,1,141.0,I remember when I started plying in season 2 being polish was used as an insult on EUNE. I’ve changed to EUW but I wonder how it is now?
hm7au8m,nitko87,11/26/2021,1,115.0,Your friend is unfortunately not playing the game in a way that is conducive to long term improvement. He might very well be trying to win every single game and when you play like that it is horribly frustrating to lose. I used to play ranked that way and it just wasn’t fun I wasn’t going anywhere and it felt like games were out of my control.  What your friend needs to do if he really wants to improve is stop trying to win and start trying to improve. Victory will follow once he actually gets better at the game.   It’s interesting. I play a lot of norms because usually I just hit gold and stop playing ranked so I see a good amount of the low elo ladder in my games. You can ALWAYS tell who’s Silver 4 or lower simply by how they play. I’d go so far as to say that people who belong in higher elo can easily get to the rank they deserve. But “Career Bronze” players (as I call them) play like you’d expect bronze players to play either because they’re truly bad at the game or they are like your friend and refuse to improve.  I’d urge your friend to do the following if they truly want to improve (some of this may be stuff they already do idk).  Drop the ego. Your friend is literally bronze. Bottom 15% or lower. He’s not good. His teammates aren’t the only reason he isn’t improving.   Stick to one main role 3 champions in that role. Learn 1-2 champ/ for their offrole  Don’t expect to win if you’re not above 7.5cs/min all game   Practice dying as few times as possible (while still going for smart plays)  Watch how pros play the game (wards roaming taking objectives etc)  Mute all every game.   Play the game as if you’re against 5 AI and with 4 on your team +you. It’s your job to win the game no one else’s. That doesn’t mean someone else might not carry and that doesn’t mean every game is winnable but you need to overperform every game to improve.  Similarly even if the game is lost do not lose focus and start playing “badly”. Continue to farm continue to look for advantages that could get you back in the game. Practice playing from behind.   If your friend tries this stuff and still can’t get better at league idk. Might be a lost cause. I have a buddy who is Silver 3 with like 600 games this season who’s got a similar issue. He’s admittedly an okay player but he still tries to play like 40 different champs has a bad mental and there’s a clear reason he never hit gold despite having the mechanics to do it.

hm7gls1,BabyEatingElephant,11/26/2021,1,12318.0,2021?  Id rank it as one of the best animated series period.
hm74ncq,jaguar317,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,Heres the thing. If Upsets situation only included himself I could definitely have seen him telling his teammates. However his situation includes someone else who has nothing to do with Adam. Imo hes right to not spread someone elses personal struggle to random public figures who are irrelevant to their life.
hm8dmti,terenul1,11/26/2021,1,44.0,Theoretically in most cases you beat her in lane and sniwball the lead in a win. But there is so much gold in the game that its basically guaranteed for any vayne to get 3 items and start running whole teams down
hm6yopa,CoogiMonster,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,I can sympathize with the Nisqy stuff because I actually thought during the regular season he was good and I can’t picture a replacement that’s an upgrade falling into Fnatic’s lap.  Adam was fine and a rookie and justifiably upset that he was being overlooked but you can’t not swing for a top 3 western Top lane (even if there was 0% chance of Alphari coming).  If anything seems true it’s that Fnatic and girlfriends/wives seem to have caused a lot of drama this last season and that hopefully mature discourse can happen also Hyli is a fucking chad awesome teammate/player/husband that is managing all those roles maturely… no point in him leaving since he’s th franchise player at this point.

hm8s8uy,zer0-_,11/26/2021,1,52.0,Im 99% sure he injected or consumed Shimmer in Act 3. Either beforr he was talking to Viktor or before Silco came looking for help because of Jinx

hm8iazg,JukebocksTV,11/26/2021,1,12.0,As adc if I need to choose between getting a minion or attacking the enemy and I can only do one I should take the cs every time. This only changes if there is kill potential. This can be arranged by the support stepping forward with me and attacking the enemy adc while I take the cs.  Any other distribution of responsibility in the bot lane is sub optimal.
hm7i4sb,After_Signature_6580,11/26/2021,1,3.0,Play 100 games of Ranked.

hm7ud3n,howtopayherefor,11/26/2021,1,551.0,But its not precise at all. I assume that you wouldnt be able to do anything else while charging forward so its not like youre multitasking and the different zones are huge: literally quadrants of the whole map. Why would you even click near the edges?  If ADCs can kite by rapidly alternating between clicking exactly on an opponent and clicking where they want to move several times a second Mordekaiser players should be able to decide after a second of channel time which quadrant of the screen their mouse should be at.
hm7zn82,mazrrim,11/26/2021,1,55.0,there are many champions in midlane that dont struggle to cs even into hard matchups.  Even faker got nullified by malzahar and punishing seraphine so hard she cant get cs and scale is extremely difficult.  Karma is the troll pick of support players midlane though.

If you only listen to hit songs on the radio and then listen to the albums they come from then you’ll probably find more than a few that are very forgettable aside from those singles but holy shit dawg there is a whole world of music out there and plenty of albums that are great from start to finish.

hm7zbv8,Salm9n,11/26/2021,1,55.0,Last hitting in a vacuum is easy for anyone with a brain but the hard part is getting the cs while trading.   Your second points rings true but I’ve also seen them just afk mid on support champs mid while the enemy roams and carries the game. I honestly think only tops and junglers are good at auto-fill mid lane. Elo based for sure too
hm7sgtg,12thBlessing,11/26/2021,1,1546.0,people downvoting you for this but for sure big personalities have discord minions that find out juicy drama through connections (employees at orgs friends on teams etc.) and relay it for attention.
hm7c2d7,notphus,11/26/2021,1,50.0,I dont think it is for a reddit post. I am not going to leak ip or employees before I have officially onboarded.

hm886cw,nitinismaldingXD,11/26/2021,1,25.0,Because it is trash..? Delaying your burst is typically not good and for sustained fights conq is better. hoB was taken for a bit but that was only when it was mega busted. Otherwise ur just better off running electro.
hm8l7p7,Random_Stealth_Ward,11/26/2021,1,17.0,Wanted? Probably not exactly but they arent intended to be the main users as chainsaw does exists and lets them apply grievous easier. Bruisers are supposed to use tank items to some extent but they are not necessarily the class they are balanced on much like DMP was mainly a bruiser item despite having tank stats and so it was balanced around bruisers.  Thornmail is mainly balanced as a tank item and so its no surprise the better users will be tanks. This is a similar situation to old Sunfire with the CC proc of damage that was added sure some bruisers could want to use Sunfire but the item was mainly catered towards tanks so the proc was mainly going to help them more than bruisers. Only real loser of this situation is Mundo since tank items that need CC procs arent as good on him and bruiser items arent necessarily good on him either.

hm7mwga,DT-Z0mby,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,its debatable whether hyli or upset was the best player on that roster. there are arguments for either and i respect both sides. lets say both were the best part of the team

hm6yn27,RoughMedicine,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Hyli sided with him because he has some decency and realised it wasnt his place to ask if Upset didnt want to share.  Just grow up already.
hm75uhs,After_Signature_6580,11/26/2021,1,4.0,They said they were working on it for over 5 years. Im sure lots was already planned and completed years ago.
hm7a6ht,jaguar317,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,I agree. You can tell that Nisqy and Bwipo are frustrated and I feel for them but they arent also sending waves of hate to Upset and his family. Adams a 19 year old rookie who just had a disaster at the pinnacle of his career. I feel bad for him too but what he facilitated with his Twitlonger is completely unacceptable.

hm88xdv,AshesOntheFire778,11/26/2021,1,51.0,Yes but look at the pick rate and ban rate. How many times have u actually seen nasus picked if you are playing in Diamond plus
hm7rw03,LakersLAQ,11/26/2021,1,89.0,You are able to build out some nice rosters with Impact though. He gets compensated for not taking up an import slot. Thats a big reason why he was valued so highly on TL in the first place aside from his good play.
hm8e8so,MapPotential9009,11/26/2021,1,20.0,Its not the players fault Riot has made the game so fast and snowbally comebacks are realistically not possible once defeat has set in. Mythic item power spikes and lethality assassins/bruisers are just unfun to play against if youre behind. Theres nothing wrong with accepting defeat and moving onto the next game. The worst is that one player who refuses to give up even though theyre 0/11 and your team hasnt secured and single dragon and the enemy just downed baron. Thats just as bad as giving up after first blood. Some games are unwinnable and Riots tragic matchmaking makes this even worse. You cannot blame someone for wanting to /ff if theyre having a shit time playing. Games are meant to be fun and enjoyable and Riot have done very little improve this. Toxicity is at an all time high and trolls go unpunished. This entire give up first and try later method as you call it is a problem Riot has created not the player. The game has become far too focused on winning at all costs even fun game modes like Urf and Ultimate Spellbook are horrendously sweaty.
hm74aij,Megaman2407,11/26/2021,1,518.0,how is that the most insane thing?
hm7m9df,No_Principle_4593,11/26/2021,1,92.0,I have to disagree on that: I personally feel a Profesional team with a multi-million dollars budget  investors sponsors and a huge fan base and media coverage to not behave like a close-knit team of doctors of a country with maybe one of the worst medical systems in western Europe...
hm6zll1,InactivePudding,11/26/2021,1,141.0,I just have no tolerance for homophobia and most of eastern europe is homophobic.  as far as im concerned they forfeited their human rights the moment they started spewing homophobic rhetoric.

hm7e7ms,edgelordweeb_,11/26/2021,1,97.0,With it being made by Buzzfeed this is the likely outcome but a Gamergate comedy has potential bc the series of events was hilarious and basically everyone involved was a loser and an idiot fighting over shit that didnt even matter. Its less funny when you think about the effects its had on society as one leg of a wider push for identity politics to take over political discourse in the west and especially the United States in order to fracture the population and prevent people from continuing to realize the major division in society is class following the success of the Occupy Wall Street movement (until it got infiltrated that is). Regardless if you let yourself forget about the wider implications of it and why it happened Gamergate is pretty fucking funny.

hm7nwrp,Craftingistheway,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Which was said by Upset to be a straight lie and honestly you have to be dumb as bricks to believe Adam on that. Dude FNC MANAGMANT KNOWS!!!!!!!!! For fucks sake they know and they go on with Upset. We dont need to know EVERYBODY has legit PROOF Upsets situation wasnt entirely bullshit. How is that so hard to grasp?!     Also just because Adams overinflated ego thinks he is the shit it is a joke that he thinks he wasnt on the chopping block when FNC was looking at people like Humanoid and Razork...

Upsets actions have consequences beyond him and if wants to value his privacy that highly it will come at a cost to the people who have to deal with it
hm7nqmz,RudeusBluerat,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,As someone who speaks both langages the legal part was a direct translation of legit from where he said: il ny a rien de legit dans le départ dUpset which would translate to something like There is nothing right/legitimate in Upsets departure.  &#x200B  It was a direct translation without context
hm8mlmr,Odd_Play_5769,11/26/2021,1,10.0,True great perspective I did not think about
hm7v1ca,Lahwtiste,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,He could just like he couldnt.  People are free to decide what they do with their private life. Emergency family situation is enough to understand that its important and concerns his family.   As he mentioned it touches his family and thus isnt willing to take any risk concerning the privacy of the person(s) affected. Seems like he feels it isnt his place to tell and I personally respect that. It doesnt have to be controversial.  For your second hypothesis thats literally a straight insult towards Upset as a competitor and slightly as a person. Its been 4 years now that he tried to get to worlds and do everything he could to go there to compete and people assuming that hed be ok to leave for something trivial thats disrespectful as hell.  As a person ? How many times people need to be reminded by Upset himself but also others that the guy was apparently in fucking pain over it and yet youre all ready to speculate over that and disregard that.
hm7jy6u,Jiffyyy,11/26/2021,1,92.0,well there is a limit to sick/emergency days you can take and if its an extended period of time you need off that exceeds what you are entitled to a year they may ask for it.   but anything within reasonable limits (I.E your days you are entitled to each year to take off) the employer cant ask for information on.
hm7ygo8,CuteKnight12,11/26/2021,1,127.0,Hahaha. I wish man. It genuinely feels the same as low elo sometimes. Just with *much* bigger egos lmao  If you want to learn quickly/improve with the game I suggest watching actually high elo streamers/YouTubers (educational ones specifically)! Watching PekinWoof for example helped me improve a lot since he talks about what kind of things hes thinking/taking note of during matches.
hm7qu5p,marlgrgr,11/26/2021,1,7.0,The funny thing is that I had a similar game a couple of days ago but a little more intense:        https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/r2ydw2/when\_you\_play\_the\_fifth\_game\_of\_your\_promo\_to/        They stopped hitting the nexus not just once but twice and the third time when they tried to win they were outplayed and lost.
hm7mlvt,DT-Z0mby,11/26/2021,1,205.0,well true. we are talking about server area though and if im not wrong the vast majority of canadians live in the south rather close to the US

hm84u6q,NeshamahX,11/26/2021,1,107.0,Congrats bro. Its been a personal goal of mine for years as well. Its awesome to see someone else succeed!
hm8kaqx,moebelhausmann,11/26/2021,1,78.0,Weird flex... Actually iam not that jelous as long as she doesnt have the Guantlets
hm86jpc,HappyLittleLongUserN,11/26/2021,1,126.0,Zilean: Dont be mad when the game gets hard since you can always be useful. Be flexible how you aproach situations because there is more than one way to play it out and you can always adapt to the team if you need engage follow up cc peel zoning or just someone clearing the waves until the carry is done scaling. This champ has it all to be honest.
hm7onq1,JamisonDouglas,11/26/2021,1,,Yeah dude this has been common knowledge for a while now. If your account is fresh (as in 0 ranked games played) and you spam normals as a 5 stack while grinding to 30 and try hard you will have stupid LP games and be able to climb like a rocket ship. Same for flex. As long as the account hasnt played ranked your games alter your MMR.    Just look up normal game MMR exploit and pick a sauce that looks to your taste theres many to choose from.

hm740kh,kazuyaminegishi,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Adam going to Upset and FNC demanding to be told the thing he was specifically told he wouldnt be told is stupid. His issue isnt that he doesnt know the specifics of why Upset left his issue is that Upset left at all. Hes not being honest with himself in that he didnt wanna play with Upset.  Upset feeling that Alphari and Perkz would be better than Adam and Nisqy isnt betrayal its how the industry works and has no correlation with Upset leaving.  Its understandable that Adam is angry but the resolutions hes looking for do not address the source of his anger. Hes angry because he doesnt like how Upset conducted himself he doesnt ask for Upset removed or an apology instead he demands the thing that he had no business knowing. Doesnt make sense.
hm76kfj,rudebrooke,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Because management and the coaching staff knew the reason and they were clearly satisfied with it. To the point where hes still on the team afterwards.
hm7u568,ConscienceNot,11/26/2021,1,15.0,Honestly as someone who plays both Jungle and Toplane sometimes you really cant do a shit and the best call is simply to not play. Well under normal circumstances you are protected by the fact that its very rarely worth it but when your jungler is imbecile and your  team as a whole cant play 4v3 then no matter how good you are at map awareness sooner or later you gonna get caught.
hm78835,Zedeknir,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,2-3 months
hm81y38,radijator22,11/26/2021,1,103.0,I am talking about they wanted to leave  They didnt want to play with larssen rge chose larssen and because of that they wanted to leave   Inspired is top2 jungler in EU and hans sama came off of monster worlds performance(and he was one of the best adcs in eu already) and org chose to stick with... larssen.  Only rational explanation was making money competing was not because if it was u drop larssen instantly and keep inspired and hans. Replacing inspired and hans is hard. Replacing a mid laner who stagnated for more than a year(apart from laning) and is a choker and a non factor in high stakes matches is a lot easier than to replace argubaly the best jungler and adc in a region
hm7mvdo,Charrend,11/26/2021,1,51.0,I can respect the need for professionalism you can still list the ranks of your coaching staff without leaking ip or employee however.  Sure feel free to DM or reply with the discord Im curious about what this is about. Coaching is a good tool bad coaching can set someone behind for years. So Id be hopeful to see good coaches.

I think they need to revert the R invis buffs since my bigger issue against her isnt the true damage but its that I cant see her most of the fight. One second of invis with a dash every 2 seconds is crazy for a 100-0 ADC.
hm879fv,Tuxxmuxx,11/26/2021,1,561.0,Something similar was a thing in counter-strike source for a little while https://counterstrike.fandom.com/wiki/Dynamic_Weapon_Pricing  Guns changed prices once a week depending on how used they were over the previous week.

hm7p9x4,teerude,11/26/2021,1,363.0,Where is he going? What roster?  I havent been able to keep up with all the movements in the off-season
hm7h2ba,Fgame,11/26/2021,1,1301.0,Hyli trusted him because Hyli is older and more mature than the other 3 and IIRC Hyli has a long term relationship as well so it stands to reason hes more familiar with the dynamic than the younger guys.
hm7a4ic,Ajwf,11/26/2021,1,121.0,> If jojos upside is greater than Jensens vs money being spent... then why not?   ....It wont be. Thats the issue. Like money being spent and upside are conflicting here. Jensen is going to be better than any rookie you pick up in their first year. I fully expect Jensen to slot in on summer and that team to make Worlds and that team to make worlds *exactly at EGs expense* because EGs roster is a solid 3 in the league right now.

hm7uv2t,pannucci,11/26/2021,1,52.0,First off just no. Smeb was also indisputably the best top laner for 2 years straight as well. So lets just get rid of that argument. Yes the gap during The Shy at his peak is higher but it was a much shorter period of time and not a flexibly style like Smeb who was the best top laner in every single meta. Tank Carry Lane Swap etc. The Shy is probably the #2 though without a doubt but really the only issue for Smeb is his lack of championships but honestly thats a pretty bullshit statistic.  &#x200B  The really only arguement against him was his start as a pro but even then now the shy has kind of matched him for bad periods as well. The rediculous thing is if not for ROX Smeb would have gone down as one of the worst top laners in history. He was a meme at the start of his career and then something happened and he was insane all of a sudden. Legit one of the best top laners in the world for 4 years straight and indisputably #1 for 2 years.
hm8i6dn,Freeman0017,11/26/2021,1,12346.0,I call it for Mel here you can see her jerk a bit before the warhead armed itself as if sensing something then her adorments start to glow and she turns to see the rocket hit the window Jayce and Victor are standing just next to her and so is Kaitlyns mother so maybe Mel is able to protect them but everyone else is as good as dead

hm72w9u,Kharn_LoL,11/26/2021,1,73.0,I mean if you want you can find some ProView VODs of his last years as a pro when he was injured and had to take months off. In my opinion he was still doing things that nobody else does to this day his mouvement patterns are just out of this world.

hm8p343,EvilMangoOfDeath,11/26/2021,1,12357.0,THIS! The worst possible thing for killing dramatic tension is knowing that no one we care about will die. Riot as much as it will hurt y’all gotta have the balls to do what’s good for storytelling not just play in the sandbox with our favorite characters with zero stakes.
hm7caww,Ulyrres,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,Idk if the stuff about Upset playing soloq games with his wife days later is true but if it is then I can definitely understand the other 3 being like rage level pissed off at him. I respect his desire for privacy i also respect their right to be royally pissed
hm7pinc,IG_Royal,11/26/2021,1,,Whats your argument to prove this point? Id argue TheShy was indisputable as the best toplaner in the world for 2 straight seasons while Smeb always had Duke CuVee and Ssumday in close company
hm7bd32,TheNedsHead,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,Feel free to speak French in chat but plz dont ignore the rest of your party/teammates speaking in English if you can read it fine. Thats the issue Ive run into and also talking trash about other players like were too stupid to recognize swear words
hm7cncc,nizzy2k11,11/26/2021,1,157.0,the problem is if you have servers in russia you have to follow russian laws. they would have to follow EU laws regardless this way they just handle the transaction fees and dont have to care about russian laws much.
hm7oka6,SnooChickens7571,11/26/2021,1,,Is that supposed to be a serious argument? Personally i dont care but the general consencus was that this season upset was their best player.
hm7wou1,vegeful,11/26/2021,1,,I been studying the different between corporate culture and their communication. In western corporate culture Upset is correct but on eastern corporate culture he need to give a bit more detail about it.   Their is less privacy for Eastern corporate culture.   Also u are correct not everyone had to know it but does his teammate not count for something? They are not random Dick and Harry. They are your team that help you journey to world.
hm78ev0,TheNedsHead,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Yep and thats why they have a big ass FRENCH button
hm70ev1,Anavarael,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Still he could have said anything tried to just give a hint of a hint of an explanation. Leaving his teammates hanging like that is a shitty way to resolve this case.

Watch how challenger Janna players lane. On ranged auto attack supports the entire laning battle contesting cs is incredibly similar to midlane  I mean... Sure? Thats not a high bar though. I can honestly agree Janna is mechanically harder than Naut or Leona. Hey Ill even give it to Soraka Lmao.  But compared to champs in other roles like Irelia Yasuo Lee Sin and Vayne? Or even Camile Ekko Graves and Cait? None of the support champs even hold up a candle even if were just talking about PvPing this is not even considering that whole having to CS the whole game while PvPing aspect.
hm7wzpj,ToasterHoaster,11/26/2021,1,,Yone just like yasuo has been on S tier ever since he came out so he’s a safe pick as long as you know how to play him. Xayah also got buffed and apparently runs aery now. Both are great choices GL!!!

hm73kyu,Stargurl4,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,An emergency in the family doesnt mean you dont have time to play a game you love. It could be anything someone could be terminal someone could have died had to have emergency surgery mental health crisis. Everything I listed are things that might require a person to just be present. Be actively engaging with their loved ones who **need them** it really doesnt matter wtf theyre doing to kill time. It doesnt invalidate Upset needed to physically be with his loved ones for a reason. Hes a human who deserves compassion.   I had to have emergency surgery last summer and I sure shit played TFT on my laptop in the hospital in the 3 days of boring ass recovery I was confined there. My husband played with me.
hm7i85w,Amsement,11/26/2021,1,144.0,I dont remember LS flat out saying he thinks Jensen is bad. Ive watched him comment on Jensens world performance and yes he has said that he doesnt think Jensen performed that well and played bad at times but didnt call him a bad player overall. From the several times hes talked about Jensen hes said that he thinks his worlds performance was overblown he wasnt impressed any of the times he watched his proview this year and that Jensens proview looked like someone just clocking in for work.  IIRC. his general impression was that he didnt think Jensens laning was good and that was a general reoccurring theme for western mid laners at that tournament. He also said based on watching Jensens play hes not really surprised that he doesnt have a team because he believes that there are other mid laners that could deliver the same performance for a cheaper price.

hm81l5h,VaporaDark,11/26/2021,1,277.0,> My guess is that its tricky to merge the elo/MMR from 1 server to another. D1 EUW is not equatable to D1 EUNE.  In theory this would only be a temporary issue where the players who result in being too high MMR for their own skill would quickly lose and drop down to where they belong.  In practice people would scapegoat the merge for years to come for causing the terrible game quality theyre already experiencing claiming things have been worse ever since it happened because the inflated players keep winning against each other and keeping each other in high Elo.  So realistically its just impossible to do it without being a PR disaster unless they want to do a full MMR reset which theyve shown to be extremely against and may possibly still lead to players scapegoating it for high Elo game quality anyway (all the bad players just spammed games to get to high Elo before the real Challengers started grinding and now its impossible to remove them because theyre playing against themselves!).  Weve literally already seen high Elo players cry out against game quality using these same excuses after the inflated LP gains in season 9 despite that bug affecting only LP not MMR and therefore not matchmaking. Anything that happens which *does* affect matchmaking would absolutely be scapegoated to hell and back and be held as a monument to Riots incompetence.
hm8rrda,Prinz_,11/26/2021,1,2.0,Yeah so many shows these days use other peoples music. And it works really well to be fair - but when you have music crafted to the scene like how Riot does with Arcane or even when the scene is influenced by the music itself (I think they mentioned that was a factor in the /dev) it really does hit different.

hm7d999,hotbooster9858,11/26/2021,1,27.0,Tbh if Riot manages to make clearing less scary (it really isnt you can get used to the kiting really easily) more people will play it just like they did with support.   Ive recently started playing jungle again since tbh I really like what they did with removing the 3:15 coin flip mechanic and now with how creative you can get with pathing its pretty fun even.   Clearing is rather easy if you path well you can almost manage to be the highest level in your team every game (which is disgusting in my opinion) with the biggest hurdle in the matchup being getting your camps stolen which can put you really far behind with the first crab being nerfed that hard.  The biggest hurdle that seems hard to overcome for Riot is how hard it is to transfer skills from any other role to jungle. You simply cant learn clearing and pathing by playing anything else while if you play any lane you HAVE to know wave management lane manipulation trading patterns and stuff like that at the same time a lot of junglers are absolutely terrible in lane because they have no idea how to lane and for sure their role wont help them with that.
hm7p2r9,dragunityag,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,From an American perspective that would still be pretty easy to find out? Least here everything gets reported on.
hm8bkrf,lostn,11/26/2021,1,180.0,deals took too long so by the time he was told he could speak to other teams theyd already found their mid laners.  And also he will only play on a top team. He could still join CLG or FLY if he wanted to but he doesnt. If he stays where he is and streams he still gets $1m a year with no pressure to perform. This is better than going to CLG for half that being on a shit team and having your stock tank.

Remember Viktor and Jayce saying that they have to crank it when talking about the frequency to stabilize the hexgems. Might mean the 2 of them will build him.

hm7op92,ZozoSenpai,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,You are kinda confusing cause and effect. FNC plays for bot bcs their top is so shit thanks to Adam you cant play towards it. Even if they wanted to they couldnt play for top instead of bot. If they played for top instead of bot whole summer split they wouldnt have made playoffs dont even mention worlds.

hm7di87,Btigeriz,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,IDK why its framed this way. Those 3 players were either replaced or left the team so its not Upset vs them. Clearly Fnatic management thought Upsets reasoning was good enough or they wouldnt be rebuilding around their botlane.

hm70ys9,puhtoinen,11/26/2021,1,141.0,As a former no-life CS:GO player russians having their own server is definitely a good thing. Theres way too many people in Russia who either cant or dont want to speak english. While thats not as big of a hindrance in LoL than it is in CS:GO they generally do not play well together with foreigners atleast based on my personal experiences.

hm6y7i7,-LostInCloud-,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,How are they supposed to communicate this?  > Upset had to leave cant provide details sadly  Should have been the end of everything. When some people feel entitled to other peoples private information I dont think thats something you can handle anyhow.  In some way they have handled it with Adam and Bwipo being gone next split so they wont poison the team anymore.
hm7caby,phieldworker,11/26/2021,1,6.0,That’s because we’ve been conditioned by a lot of content that winning is the only way to measure growth. instead look for smaller goals that you can track that will help string together wins. Things like CS per min low death average damage to objects  etc.   But in the end if you’re not having fun just don’t play anymore.
hm7lizp,Rikkimaaruu,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Losing all my Q3 Demos was one of my biggest losses in life so many fun memories from online and LAN sessions.  And yeah russians come close second behind french guys when it comes to stuff like that.
hm7m0vz,Mikael7529,11/26/2021,1,205.0,Yeah. Valorant somehow manages to have one Europe server and this game is even more dependent on low ping than League.
hm7lgb4,Spitfire836,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Which he *didnt* do according to Adam’s post and can me implied he didn’t because of Bwipo and Nisqy also being upset at him.

hm6yxs0,GuyOnTheMoon,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,I would argue that Upset’s inaction in his communication led to the twitlonger and flaming of Upset.

hm79v23,SirDavve,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,people react and handle situations differently which is another reason why I think comparing it to DL or perkz is unhelpful. Just because it is something that you would be comfortable sharing doesnt mean he is. Also I doubt youre as famous or subjected to as much public scrutiny as someone like Upset is so I think it will be hard for any of us to put ourselves in his shoes.
hm8q9we,stuffslols,11/26/2021,1,17.0,Yes. I do. Its happened more often youd believe where a good scaling champ with a horrible early (yasuo kayle senna etc) lost their lane (lack of jungle presence countersink whatever) and came back to carry the game well after that when random skirmishes develop for objectives. This is especially true in lower elos which make up the majority of the games that are played. Thats not even taking into account times when person got accused of inting and the other 4 wanted to ff because said person died one time on accident.  Games almost always cannot be decided at the 15 minute mark. The outcome is much more clear at 20.
hm70lpu,TH3RM4L33,11/26/2021,1,51.0,True its been negative 7 days since the last one.

hm7dld2,InvitemetoSkeet,11/26/2021,1,64.0,>HoB ADCs arent meta because they either got nerfed or switched to abusing lethal tempo which can be very very blatantly seen with shit like Draven and Ashe going up while using lethal tempo which they previously completely ignored  Still not seeing any Lethal Tempo oppression in worlds. You know the ideal world for HOB when LT wasnt broken. When HOB drastically outperformed.  >HoB quite literally always outperformed pissqueror on him in terms of winrate because conqueror is an awful terrible rune  Complete lie dude go look for youself \^\_\^. HOB was prob better but definitely not after prowlers nerfs.  Draven Literally had a higher pickrate and winrate last patch anyway.  Please stop lying its telling you have to resort to that but its also just embarrassing.  >AP twitch is a shit tier pick thats played once for every 100 AD twitch games. I get that the fungal growths are making you unable to see it but enormous majority of those HoB games are AD twitch with it being deflated further down by the awful AP build  Queue UP NA in Diamond mmr please and pick that bullshit please I want the dub.   [https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=moving%20object%202](https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=moving%20object%202)  But its also a lie lol go down as far as you want most AD twitch games dont go HOB.

Heres my evidence                                   .
hm7w5ni,lolKhamul,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,> Youre saying that like Upset didnt commit years of his own life to the game and the competition and like he didnt work very hard during this whole year. And you almost make it sounds like he left on purpose and without consequences for himself.  Never ever said that. But if he ruins only his own committed time (if hed play a 1v1 esport) its not affecting anyone else. Thats a major fucking difference to making that move in a team environment. Nobody can blame him for throwing his time down the drain. They blame him because he threw away their invested time.  > If he left its because he had good reasons .....  The reason doesnt matter and neither does whether it was justified. Its fucking irrelevant. The public doesnt need to know. We will never know. Even if we knew it would not fucking matter what we think about it. Its not even relevant what you or anyone else thinks about him as a person and how he would act. **All that changes nothing. In the end his decision ruined the year of all other FNC players and staffers. And thats a fucking indisputable fact and they have every fucking right to be mad about it. Especially since they cant even get closure because they dont know why.**   Upset owes the public jack shit. Not an explanation nor a reason. And the public doesnt have any right to threat him bad. But everyone on that FNC team does. And imo he ows every single staffer on FNC an explanation whether he trusts them or not.

hm7tyil,JevonP,11/26/2021,1,144.0,It is possible to use your brain and consider why you lost over hes just mechanically better than me this isnt a fucking fighting game most outplays have very very little do with actual mechanical skill
hm89g0w,ConscienceNot,11/26/2021,1,,The thing is that your statement is trash. In 99% of case sceratios. At early levels you are going to make use out of hob way much more than out of electro and if you dont opt for full lethality then hob is better rune even at late and actually gives you damage when you need to use emp W for whichever reason. Also it has much better CD. Cong might be at longer fights but fights that last much longer than 2 or 3 seconds and sucks at other aspects. HoB isnt best from both worlds but is very close and thats the point. Best early game rune and best rune when you go full crit.

hm71k6e,Acegickmo,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,name checks out
hm8p4m6,advanceshipper,11/26/2021,1,131.0,but how good of a player could he have been if he lost lane as jayce against kayle? was what I was getting at. altho tbf it could just be how good theshy was at his peak.
hm7glza,Lahwtiste,11/26/2021,1,1301.0,Thats the thing people usually dont understand or chose to ignore.  People can have different definitions or opinions of the same thing.   Maybe what Upset shared in those meetings wasnt enough for the other players to relate to it or for them its not a good enough reason or something else. We cant know for sure but what one of them say wont necessarily dismiss what the other say.  And as I said in another message and you also touched about in your last sentence is the what could happen.  I might be totally wrong but from all the infos that got told it seems that the team knew he had personal issues but they werent aware that him leaving was a possibility. If they had known that they might have requested Bean to get more scrim time to prepare for that. In the end that possibility apparently became the only option since Upset said that it got worse and had to leave.  Management didnt do a good enough job in the end but its somewhat a tough situation to be in for all party involved. That also could explain why Bwipo unfollowed FNC staff on twitter because he was pissed he wasnt aware of all possibilities.
hm7l8be,ConscienceNot,11/26/2021,1,4.0,Yeah especially when you kind of are supposed to win early since you already fall off at late game anyway and now they get bounty on top of that. Beautiful.
hm7ls72,c9haiondrugs,11/26/2021,1,1428.0, TBH it be better if he took a year off from LEC.Like Bwipo alluded to if Upset quits because of a sudden emergency needs attention that requires him to fly away from worlds and play aram then FNC shouldve also encouraged Bwipo to leave too. Bwipo wanted to quit after hearing Upset quit because he was also mentally distraught after finding out about the situation on top of the fact he missed his girlfriend at home. But thats when it goes too far. Bwipo is encouraged to manage his burdens but Upset gets a pass?   He shouldnt get harassed but he doesnt get a pass either. And I think its ridiculous he would have any input on the roster after abandoning them at the most important time and creating the roster collapse domino starting with Bwipo.  If Upset pulls  the same thing next year is it acceptable? If we find out every time hes away from home for 2+ weeks and him being MIA is impacting those close to him in a bad way? Not a big deal as they probably wont make worlds but still.

Like they may come as news to you but you have to trust my judgment is precisely the type of relationship you have with your god damn fucking boss...

hm8iozm,Euphoricas,11/26/2021,1,174.0,It’s always the people blaming others that play the worst on the team and start throwing. Yes sometimes it really is your team mates but 90% of the time when I die/lose I’ll be like to my duo “shoot I should’ve done this and not done this this and this” and that’s what helps you to improve. Realizing when you yourself could have done better and how you could have done better. My friends have the same mindset (mostly) so it’s never really toxic and we’re always getting better.

hm84ck6,Ruesap,11/26/2021,1,,The team gambles on said player because they believe it will be their best option. If player wants to leave like Alphari did then Liquid only had to pay Alphari for 1 year and they were paid by Vit basically for what they paid Alphari so they end up playing with a player for free discounted or even a profit. As for the player for the money if they can get a long term contract they feel they will get paid for those 3 years. Job security.
hm8e9tk,Attre_-,11/26/2021,1,112.0,Youngbuck still has more regional trophies than Grabbz hes also got the world finals down. The only difference is the MSI win vs more LEC split wins.

hm7snkp,hiccup333,11/26/2021,1,12336.0,Lol had to sort this thread by controversial to find ppl to commiserate with.  Yeah I hate when an individual season doesnt satisfy.  When they kick meaningful resolution down road to a later season.  Made me feel shortchanged and not want to reward the show with continued viewership
hm6zwn1,tameniee,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,He saw we all struggling to read that tweetlong and just decided to put out a summary of everything he said there
hm7rtqy,uncertainrandompal,11/26/2021,1,124.0,he literally played arams nonstop duo with her as soon as he arrived. is this immediate action needed from him he talked about?
hm7g0fv,xiyeonah,11/26/2021,1,196.0,Why are you talking about Ibai? How is he comparable to retired pros from League? Hes in a completely different sphere in streaming. I am talking about NA personalities like IWD QTpie Doublelift Sneaky etc where they have another career after their professional careers. Some of these content creators are making more money than the top LEC players so of course its enticing.   You have to propose an argument that playing professionally in NA would be worth it but in honesty even if NA wins some of these streamers are making more. You have pros like Bunnyfufu who has a Youtube channel with 1.7m subs and probably made more money off his channel than he would have as a pro.   American viewers are worth more than European viewers because they speak one language. EU might have more people than NA but the viewing demographic is split because of the different languages. Its much easier to grow an audience in NA than EU for these reasons.

hm7eil3,Jiffyyy,11/26/2021,1,56.0,its not scummy to keep personal life information to yourself. what would they do with that information? would it make their worlds any better? people simply want to know so they can judge for themselves.  does your own work force you to disclose all your personal doings just so they know

hm7gn4b,amroth6464,11/26/2021,1,1301.0,you seem to forget that Upset family who has nothing to do with esport are the most impacted.  And their story isnt supposed to leak to thousands of people because a 19yo kid feels bitter.

hm7nc1h,TempestCatalyst,11/26/2021,1,163.0,The mode literally had a smaller playerbase than co-op vs AI on SR. If you tried to play ranked and got higher than plat you were likely to get thrown against challenger players because there was no one in your MMR range. More than enough players is a pretty bold claim
hm7hxhb,riceislifeuwu,11/26/2021,1,6.0,Ive followed you on insta for years ever since your fmab fanart! Love u 🤩
hm7y8o8,AlexAsks,11/26/2021,1,277.0,Im from Finland pretty much as North it gets in EU and I still get better ping on EUW. EUNE is for the people who dont know any better. They start LoL look at the server names.  Toxicity is pretty much equal prolly heavier on EUW. But EUNE ranked is a joke. Anybody from there will drop a division coming EUW
hm8aset,chutiyamod92,11/26/2021,1,113.0,ikr people troll the preseason then next season they are in silver and complain I get 10LP for win but lose 20 LP for loss  riot stupid wawawa
hm738y2,Saphrogenik,11/26/2021,1,42.0,Lmao different people and situations entirely. Everybody copes differently. Like you coping with the fact Upset would put his family over his team so you assume the worst.
hm8om5f,BigDritzy,11/26/2021,1,134.0,Well done King 👏👏
hm758pm,AliceInHololand,11/26/2021,1,51.0,Bruh Talon is this bugged and still as strong as he is? Absurd.
hm6yjsm,widhfbez,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,His PR team better explain why was he boosting his gf while his teammates were getting ass fisted in groups.
hm71dfy,mistood,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,People have said that checking the social media of his family everyone seems okay.    The reason has to do with his wife apparently. Before he left he told the team that his wife is feeling bad/ in pain/lonely something along those lines. Its definitley because of his wife.     If his family member was actually dying he could let his teammates know (not the public) and they would understand him. They might not like it but they will understand it. The fact he keeps saying muh privacy makes me believe he doesnt have a real reason. When Perkz and Doublelift had their tragedies the whole community rallied in support of them and understood their situation. I dont understand why he doesnt tell just his teammates he doesnt have to tell the public.
hm7x9mw,FancyTopVR,11/26/2021,1,8.0,Yeah Im trying. Thank you
hm88fn7,bns18js,11/26/2021,1,92.0,>Seraphine has consistently one of the best win rates as adc and its mostly played by off role support players lol.  That just proves the champion is easy to get value out of? Its the same reason why Annie has always held a good winrate in all elos. Thats the opposite of what you want to say. Seraphine usually wins by --- lose lane low CS through out spells in teamfight for easy value and carry that way.  >My mage adc and mid win rates are mostly just as high as support I just like the role more.  Mage ADC is easier than ADC. ADCs need better mechanics to properly kite with. But yes if youre playing mage ADCs at least thats alot harder than playing support.  You as a single person might be an exception to the rule. Maybe youre mechanically insane but you just like how support plays. I can believe that.  The the overall pattern is that the support role is the easiest mechanically and people who play it tend to be the worst compared to others at the same elo. That does not change even if youre an anomaly.  (You still havent addressed the population issue. I assume at least you agree on that front).
hm8pm9z,Mejalu,11/26/2021,1,26.0,I really cant believe that you are telling me that its ok to give up in a game that you chose to play and then making a case for it like its not a majority cause for a lot of the toxicity in this game.   Whether youre losing or winning play the game. I dont get the point if youre not going to play. What do you play the game for?   Do you just play the game for lp? What kind of emptiness is that
hm88qmm,Kripox,11/26/2021,1,25.0,Vi is not weak she is super strong after the code cleanup she got a little while back. Possibly not in terms of jungler 1v1s at lvl 4 but she is really good overall. Currently hovers around top 10 wirnates for any champ in the game too despite having seen her pickrate go up a lot recently.
hm77qkw,leoleosuper,11/26/2021,1,518.0,Nope. They just got developed around the same time.
hm71ld3,jaguar317,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Why do his teammates NEED to know the exact reason he left? They already very obviously know he left for a family emergency that needed his immediate attention. Is he really so obligated to say more than that? Also about this second family shit... lmao. Yeah the guy that Upset has known for less than one year who has shown himself to be so unprofessional and douchey that he publicly bashed Upset who has shown himself to be incredibly immature in soloqueue who literally doesnt talk in any of FNCs voice comms is the guy that Upset would tell his most private information to. Adam knew enough. If he was truly a good teammate he would trust that Upset wouldnt leave for some minor petty reason. If you want to talk about being a shitty teammate you have your #1 candidate Adam right there.

hm8p8fk,OrangeGremlin1,11/26/2021,1,29.0,Almost nothing in the game is even close to balanced right now and vayne is no different. She has counters and interactability which is why fewer people complain about her.
hm8bg9u,Jiffyyy,11/26/2021,1,150.0,>Thats fine but people dont have to respect some vague bullshitty answer.  its not the answer that is being respected its the wishes of the person to have their private life stay private. they dont have to like the vague response its not meant to please their minds or anything.
hm7g6dp,ukendtkunst,11/26/2021,1,2.0,I think a way to solve it would be to make it so that it’s only neutral objectives. That way you’re able to counterplay it.
hm7pibb,DangerousSeaweed0,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,for one  its not reddit that is harassing him  but twitter mostly.  secondly  its not that reddit cant take a no. we dont need to be the ones to know whatever the fck is happening with him or his wife or if its even the case that its something or not in the first place.  were all arguing that upset fcked over his teammates and gave them no reason. u cant have 2 people come out and say they had no ideea about the situation untill 12h before the tournament start  and imply upset handled this rightfully.  if anything  if fnc knew that this was goin for 2 weeks  it makes even less sense for them to not give bean a lot more scrim time then 2 10 minute games.  so its obvious that somebody is lying here  and as it stands ...its a 1v3.

hm7ueof,Dafuq313,11/26/2021,1,124.0,So just because he played some aram games with his gf it means it wasnt anything serious? People cope in different ways maybe someone important was in hospital he spent the night there and then went home to play some aram games with hif gf I see nothing wrong with that.

hm7mpu2,bonly,11/26/2021,1,59.0,If person A is queuing up in the single solo queue to try to win a game person B is trying to practice a new role person C is trying a new talent D is drunk and E is just playing for fun then all 5 are toxic towards the other 5.  Solo Queue is a shitty way to match up with and play with total strangers. If youre at plat level most of the time and youre rocking something you play at bronze level you are hurting your team...but theres no other way to learn a champion so LoL literally forces you to be toxic.

hm7uhat,Ok-Travel-7875,11/26/2021,1,2.0,Its been this way for years.  Much better to make a new acc the moment you feel even remotely stuck and just get the good MMR and gains again rather than trying to fix what you currently have.   Riots system is quite shit.
hm85vm2,SituationGood922,11/26/2021,1,92.0,at this exact moment who do you think is the best player on the server if you were to add up their current skill in all 5 roles?  do you think Tyler1 is very near the top?

hm7xjp3,mazrrim,11/26/2021,1,,really cba getting into this argument.  I would call adcs the worst overall players at the same elo they look the worse off role whereas you can trust non 1 trick support players to competently play midlane most of the time.   I am talking about in at least d2+ here.
hm81ve5,LookinForDatSixPack,11/26/2021,1,2.0,For anyone who is curious I ended up playing Darius mid because my mid lane didnt want to play Kassadin into Sylas. He ended up letting the enemy Kat top get fed but it all worked out in the end! It was a fun first game to start my evening with :)

hm79m6t,mistood,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,Upset meets a camgirl/onlyfans girls who lives in South America online dates her for 2 months and decides to marry her. This is her 3rd marriage and she even has nudes available online. You can tell from her social media that she has many red flags.  The fact that he chose to leave 12 hours before the first game suddenly makes me believe that the camgirl wife gave some sort of ultimatum. I do believe there is some truth in Adams statement of her feeling lonely. From her bio you can tell after they married she moved to Germany away from her home in South America. She is probably not adjusting well with no friends and family except Upset. The ultimatum was probably something like  I want to go back home to South America if you dont come back then I will leave. If his wife was truly sick it doesnt make sense that he would sudenly leave 12 hours before the game. The timing doesnt make sense. He knew he had to choose his wife or league and he chose league. The real reason would give him so much criticism that I believe he chose to put it under the guise of muh privacy. If he had a real reason people would understand support and respect his decision to leave.     So my theory involves that this unstable camgirl wife had some sort of mental breakdown and told her 2 month old husband who was away due to Worlds preparations to tend to her or she will leave.
hm7oop0,ARMIsNOTLoaded,11/26/2021,1,7.0,This is why no matter how many time you ping me I wont stop hitting the Nexus just because you want to buy your full build or continuing using the enemies as punching bags: I dont want to risk a comeback or dragging the game longer that it needs (time is important for everyone me you our teammates and our enemies) also I find it really disrespectful for the enemies.
hm8qq7j,rjaydo2,11/26/2021,1,26.0,I play ranked to gain LP that is correct. I enjoy that aspect because then I play at a higher level push myself to think harder and more creatively and I enjoy the competition as a whole. I have my fun in clash and nornals or flex with friends then take this part more seriously. Im not toxic about it but when Im looking to gain LP and only have a limited time to play I dont waste my time on a game we are down 12-0 in 10 mins and I havent been able to touch a jungle camp in 2 mins. The odds of coming back are very very slim.   Im not rank shaming but have you played in the aforementioned ranks? You dont get up there if you dont at least have some idea how to close out a game. Please also recall Im describing D2+. I dont ff on any alt account simply because it IS a problem in the game for many people that dont understand what a lost game really looks/feels like.
hm86kwy,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,92.0,relative to the TOP of the ladder Tyler1 I dont think he is near the top. I do think Tyler1 is probably the hardest grinder of anyone to ever exist during my time of playing that I know of. I have huge respects for his grind. The best player on the server question is really hard we dont have any like god sent multi role talents like other regions do. Im not sure.
hm7cukb,V1pArzZ,11/26/2021,1,102.0,When i played twitch jungle i won a lot of games by level 2 ganking their top then repeatganking when they tp up. Many toplaners just straightup go afk and flame in chat after that.

hm6zmtz,TH3RM4L33,11/26/2021,1,51.0,Ive always seen them hitting air but not disappear. Maybe vanish might be whats screwing it up.
hm7mt85,CuteTao,11/26/2021,1,63.0,I wouldnt be surprised if bjerg took a salary cut in order to help secure the roster tho
hm7m920,leo158,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,He said he was transparent in his post. He was so transparent his team mates felt like they were left in the dark.
hm7985x,Xsell1ze,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,He was so proud of fnc that he played duoq when they were getting destroyed.
hm73qms,moroheus,11/26/2021,1,42.0,Are you sure you arent projecting a little bit here
hm7a13j,mistood,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,So the reason he doesnt want to share with his teammates is because its fucking embarassing to show simp you are. Keep in mind she has hundreds of nudes available online was a sexcamgirl/onlyfans and by some South Americans claiming she dabbled in sex work.
hm7pgea,No_Principle_4593,11/26/2021,1,,The question was if he should have to justify leaving worlds to his bosses and team mates which is indeed a management matter
hm7y87u,xGlaedr,11/26/2021,1,,Which is why I said kinda. Also I doubt people would be happy of bounties were permanent like champ bounties. Similar systems but they have to be balanced differently because they impact the game differently.  Btw the time limit on bounties as far as Ive seen is only triggers when the gold gap closes so the two things you mention are actually 1 way they work differently.
hm7oliv,vegeful,11/26/2021,1,,1 week later and league player still cant tell a different between a normal job 9-5 and an esport job. U can miss out for 1 week in the job for emergency meeting and not a single one of your co-worker get fired and your company become a clown.    There is a degree of importance between missing out on daily job and missing out on a job that require u to be there once a year or probably only once a lifetime.   Its like collecting all 7 of super dragon ball by accident and then ur friend steal ur wish then fkin Shenron gone that the level of frustration Adam feel.
hm75dsx,Rhadamantos,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Literally just open his Twitter.

hm78ttt,Kierenshep,11/26/2021,1,518.0,I mentioned it elsewhere but people didnt do it cause they didnt know how broken 5 tp/fortify was with 5 tanks stacking Sunfire (that stacked on itself and with your allies).

hm6yr8b,bynature123,11/26/2021,1,3.0,The new support about “money” and the ADC were pulled from Arcane and do not relate to Arcane characters anymore. It says in the roadmap above they didn’t quite fit so they’re being pushed back to 2022 and will have their own releases and stories to tell. This means everything about Arcane is off the tables Corina Veraza could certainly become a champ but I highly doubt she’s our cash goblin.   Also I think there was a leak involving Corina on the Chinese wild rift patch I think Corina is going to become the first ever exclusive wild rift champion I could be wrong but that’s what I read from a few different leaks.   The final thing that keeps me from believing this is we already have a plant support champ named Zyra and she’s doing very well this year growing in popularity. I doubt riot would put another plant champ in the support role (all 3 of them are supports) I think it would be a lot smarter if they made a mid laner or top laner out of Corina or even a poisonous jungler.
hm7ctjw,LyusGen,11/26/2021,1,14.0,Looks like you were right and either the wiki is wrong or my interpretation of it was wrong. Heres the clip showing his bounty going down when as the game progressed.  https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/r2y69c/kill\_gold\_bounty\_slowly\_adjusting\_based\_on\_enemy/
hm7cegm,ezprodigy,11/26/2021,1,157.0,have people advocating for the merging of servers actually played games like that before? Dota 2 have different servers too but no region lock so you can play on whatever server you want and as a result both NA and EU are fucking horrifying every other game is 4 peruvians or 4 russians on your team screaming in their own language and communication is basically 0 people think its just gonna be oh I can play with my friend who goes on a different server more are in for a rude awakening if this actually happens.  Its funny how in Dota 2 people are begging for region lock so you actually only match people in your region whereas here people actually think everybody in eastern Europe is gonna speak English and nothings gonna happen
hm89yc5,No-Glass3257,11/26/2021,1,97.0,Yeah the LPL rules prevented it
hm6z08z,Nicolu_11,11/26/2021,1,51.0,Are there any other bugs that you didnt include for any reasons (reproduction rate for example)?  Great post btw upvoted <3
hm8rmdt,not_toxic_enough,11/26/2021,1,1.0,This is the coldest take on the sub
hm7z1dc,penguin2561,11/26/2021,1,88.0,As someone who just started playing late 2020 and an average LCK and LPL enjoyer his return really hypes me up because I only get to see his montages in youtube.
hm856g5,TH3RM4L33,11/26/2021,1,159.0,I noticed that pressing W - Basic - R or W - R - Basic buffers both the basic attack and the ultimate after W. So its not always like that.
hm8r2lk,errorme,11/26/2021,1,8.0,Honestly Id just recommend trying whatever is free and figure out what you like from that.
hm7a4e6,963852741hc,11/26/2021,1,29.0,Depends on the contract.   Any agent worth their salt would have a protection clause guaranteeing some sort of pay

hm7i13u,steve_pays_me,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,I think a few years from now an awful goddamn lot of people here are gonna feel like shit.  I suspect pregnancy loss.  zero facts to back it up just a gut feeling.
hm7jccv,NUFC9RW,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Its fine wanting to replace someone but they shouldnt find out through social media.
hm7nny5,BurningApe,11/26/2021,1,,This is like typical american mentality - freedom privacy above all. It doesnt mean shit I need freedom to breathe and not wear a mask so I will happily spread covid germs to others.  I need privacy so I would like to leverage this human right to disrespect half of my entire team by not telling them any details about what was so serious that caused me to ditch the most important tournament of their year in the last minute. Sometimes life isnt about rules you can play around those rules however much you want but sometimes its better to be a mature good person and naturally you will have a better outcome. Upset played by the rules of I am entitled to my privacy and look how that ended.  Its extremely unlikely Bwipo or Adam would have leaked it if they were told the truth given that Yamato and the other manager hasnt leaked anything yet.
hm8emwq,Mejalu,11/26/2021,1,20.0,I feel bad for him too.
hm7arcs,SilveredUndead,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,Maybe Im particularly coloured by this sort of stuff in particular but if his wife tried to take her own life I cannot imagine any world where he would even be remotely ready to talk roster moves as quickly as he was. I dont know if you fully realize how hard it hits you when someone close to you tries to do this sort of thing.   It also really doesnt matter. Its not for the public to know only those close to him that he trusts. Which doesnt include his own teammates that got him to Worlds hence the drama.
hm8izde,WintersEnvoy,11/26/2021,1,315.0,Normal mmr (very likely) affects the first time you ever get placed thats it
hm7vuyt,akutasame94,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,He didnt trust any players from his team other than Hily? And Hily said he doesnt want to know and supposedly still doesnt know.   So you are telling me Upset told someone from another team but didnt trust his own teammates?   Even if I think what Adam did was dumb and immature this is just bad on both sides.
hm8snzc,TheRealOppendonger,11/26/2021,1,,It might be duo abusing with the Lowly smurf player that helped with that support win rate
hm76xaj,DroPowered,11/26/2021,1,11.0,She’s cute is she single?
hm7kmvk,SolaSenpai,11/26/2021,1,13.0,because if you do dmg to minions itll make it push towards the enemy lane and they wont be able to access their cs till an enemy pushes it back essentially denying multiple waves (assuming a tower as fallen)
hm8itr0,Freeman0017,11/26/2021,1,12350.0,I dont think that Jinx jinxed it either they just were agreeing with his plan and the deal he made with Silco wich include him handing over her in so my best guess is that season 2 is not about war but everyone hunting her down Vi just rushing agains the clock to save her or stop her before she does something worse
hm74tam,KvotheM,11/26/2021,1,42.0,I think a big age gap sex work multiple divorces and getting married early for a Visa is not a good thing in a relationship. Whether it is a guy or girl who is youngest.
hm7oyp1,No_Principle_4593,11/26/2021,1,,We are talking about the whole situation which is a big shit show one again and an other systemic failure from fnc management Professionnal esport teams are businesses and should be managed that way not like a non profit team of doctors in a public hosoital Also do you not understand my point that following how health system is managed is a pretty bad idea for a business especially considering the health system in question is a relative failure compared to its direct neighbours?
hm83w76,NotAStatistic2,11/26/2021,1,,Hey man this is the closest at lot of these guys will get to having a member of the opposite sex acknowledging them
hm6yi17,BDNjunior,11/26/2021,1,277.0,And irelia ryze azir kalista ornn sylas i can go on for days. This guy talking about viego like it didnt happen to every pro picked champion.
hm8rqzg,MyzMyz1995,11/26/2021,1,128.0,With how hes acting in the aftermath and how he was acting on twitter in the LCS season I wouldnt be surprised TL just didnt want to work with him anymore unfortunately in 2021 we cant get stuff like breaking point anymore.
hm7u5y1,LeagueReddit00,11/26/2021,1,161.0,Its not that serious. If anyone played competitive games on consoles you would see how common ddossing is especially on games where you have p2p hosting.
hm792g1,RemoteAnalysis3809,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Im gonna guess that his wife had a first/second trimester miscarriage that went nasty. The timeline matches and the pregnancy explains why they got married so quickly. It also explains why he cared so much since thats his wife and child who might have been in critical condition. I dont think you can play with such a state of mind.   It also explains why Upset seems to be holding the secret not just for himself but also for his wife. You dont want to go around telling people you met at work about your wifes pregnancy going nasty. Especially when you and your wife are both in a line of work where everything you do gets discussed by 16 yo dudes online.   Considering that his wife is also a somewhat public figure and even worse a sexy woman I can already imagine the kind of harassment that would take place if dude opens his mouth.
hm7vnlu,EH0_0,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,I just dont like the argument if its 3 vs 1 so something must be wrong with Upset. Is every time a larger group of people pounding on one person means they are right? I really believe it is an organizational issue. If you do not trust your team with details on your family issue the org need to make sure to convey the right words to the team while you need to leave and deal with family issues.  I had situations in my life when I could not even call my work to let them know what is happening because it was a big emergency and people unfortunately were left in the dark for hours.
hm7hnjw,InactivePudding,11/26/2021,1,184.0,deport from planet/life.  I recognize it is harsh but i do not tolerate intolerance. at all.
hm76tip,happygreenturtle,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,The problem is not that Upset didnt tell them what happened but that he apparently made no effort to help them understand on an emotional level where he was coming from. Its really cold to leave within a day of the most important tournament of the year and then not even speak to your team to repair the damage when you come back.  The way Adam wrote his comments was as though Upset said Sorry I have to be with my girlfriend left and then upon coming back made no effort to reconcile with the teammates he abandoned (even if for good reason) and actually attempted to replace them behind their backs as soon as whatever drama was happening in his personal life was dealt with. That is.. kind of messed up and honestly fuck players like that. They always cause more trouble than theyre worth
hm7gkpc,pocoyoO_O,11/26/2021,1,1301.0,This is the type of explanation he should have given his teammates at the time
hm84epo,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,92.0,wtf it just auto corrected it to THE 🐐
hm75a1s,Tittymotorboat,11/26/2021,1,42.0,Figures as it remains I have yet to see somebody on reddit correctly use the projection buzzword.  Nice attempt though
hm839pu,Kinghero890,11/26/2021,1,159.0,bunch of bugfixes bout to raise his winrate 3%
hm7uit0,pannucci,11/26/2021,1,52.0,He has since day 1 said he only wants to play with rookie. Nothing has changed. He actually has been on record saying he would retire if he didnt play with him so its actually pretty insane hes considering playing in LCK without him.
hm7vsph,showtime1010,11/26/2021,1,3.0,smart but idk if i can do it with nidalee since she has 12 skins ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob)
hm76s5d,happygreenturtle,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Yeah I dont understand the comparisons. It wouldnt make sense to compare the conduct in a random office job to the inner workings of a professional football team either. While professionalism is required they are still **sports teams** lol
hm6ytxk,dgar19949,11/26/2021,1,7.0,I think if you aren’t getting shield reduction your ganna have a bad time otherwise they are both scrub killers.
hm7nfmm,BulletCola,11/26/2021,1,551.0,It has several ideas that were scrapped as wel:  Such as him having a scaling HP passive that increases by 1 based on doing something very simple among others.  Also he was going to have a kit overhaul akin to Sion Poppy and Urgot as well before any of these ideas were explored I believe.
hm7wwxh,FancyTopVR,11/26/2021,1,8.0,Im talking about the matchmaking that the enemy team has been a much much higher level than anyone on my team for the past 11 games. this includes me.
hm7a96x,Potkrokin,11/26/2021,1,1191.0,They probably had better tryouts than him or were cheaper or any number of reasons that we don’t have access to lol.  Either way do you actually think “well he might be better than the two players likely to be the worst mids in the league” is a great argument for someone who has been hanging around since 2016?
hm85289,LimeJosh,11/26/2021,1,39.0,He gave viktor an altered version of the drug to help his body handle the hexcore or whatever it is

hm8c94i,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,108.0,Thank you. When I graduate Ill definitely give it some time to see where Im at with league in general.
hm70bli,Caenen_,11/26/2021,1,51.0,Vanish doesnt exist its a fancy name we have on the wiki so the concept of going untargetable and hiding your character and their stuff (VFX health bar) from the renderer is more accessible. Its just untargetability most of the time with a missile pop as usual.  You might want to check if the blades get popped by Yuumi W or Poppy R (on enemy) aswell. Those dont pop incoming missiles. Are you saying the missiles visually disappear but they keep going anyway?
hm7o4g4,Bonsparks,11/26/2021,1,3.0,Oh no 10lp lost at Gold. Its the whole reason youre not in Worlds. Your life is ruined.
hm70j9g,Twoja_Morda,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,What exactly do you think fnc management could have done? You cant really avoid having immature players react this way if they choose to do so.
hm7b7th,Agreeable_Junket_271,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,No one disagrees that Upset considers it an emergency.  The contention is centered around the fact that the very thing that he considers an emergency may not be what his teammates or indeed the average person would consider a moral justification to leave the team like he did.  Do you personally believe that it is 100% of the time morally justifiable to do something that (intentionally or not) harms other people on the basis that you are responding to an event that you personally consider an emergency regardless of what the actual contents of that event are?
hm8d1dv,noahkillis,11/26/2021,1,128.0,Lucian taught me how to move ever so slightly when aaing so my auto attacks would focus enemy champs or minions. also spell weaving and not wasting the double autos. Countless times have I been saved by e - aa - w - aa - q - aa combo. I have seen so many of my friends and even other enemy Lucians just spam their abilities and auto-attack at the end and end up losing the trade by like 2-3 autos.   &#x200B  &#x200B  &#x200B  &#x200B  Ekko taught me I shouldnt be afraid to press R just because it isnt the best Ult possible
hm8l2il,VecnaBlade,11/26/2021,1,140.0,Id like to see you go at it again on AD as a fresh account. Id just like to see how many games it would take you since all of these accounts have high mmr to start with. Climbing from pisslow on a fresh account to masters is much different than one that has had masters/high diamond mmr multiple seasons. Not that you wouldnt hit masters anyway but still would be interesting to see.
hm709jg,PresentMiddle8974,11/26/2021,1,62.0,Hey congrats on plat. Although king stix is not a very good source of info if you have some time you should just search up builds in eve mains reddit or discord if u want to main her. Those places usually have the most optimal builds for any champs which are backed by high elo one tricks.
hm7k0pp,ACertainUser123,11/26/2021,1,92.0,Well Adams situation is worse than the others he also had upset go behind his back and talk to Fnatic about replacing him with alphari. So its like he stabbed adam in the back twice so i get why hes really annoyed at upset. But yea he shouldnt have speculated about his situation.
hm7vmjy,Epamynondas,11/26/2021,1,551.0,Nah the esports chronobreak just simulates the entire game from the beginning based on the stored player inputs
hm7vt1w,sukableet,11/26/2021,1,252.0,There still are plenty of words that are lets say 6+ letters in fact according to a quick google search there are more than 200k of them (in English). Now I cant check for Russian but I suppose it is more or less in the same ballpark.
hm7ihrw,sscyth1,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,lol he wants them to apolgize for him i think
hm720gr,RavenFAILS,11/26/2021,1,141.0,Literally no difference to french people then also probably not a good idea to just have servers to reinforce racist stereotypes.
hm7loxx,LazerFruit,11/26/2021,1,62.0,Probably upset with how worlds went or wanted changes that the org didnt want to make
hm8tjkd,arbor-demure,11/26/2021,1,3.0,I just know this was during the lesbian drama shower scene. I just know it.
hm8r62a,imjunsul,11/26/2021,1,58.0,This would make LCK very interesting lol. T1 DK and GenG should greatly improve from experience or roster changes. Other 3-4 teams improve as well...
hm7dodo,DatDesolationDoh,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,Yeah this. It’s so easy to stay vague but still show some respect to your teammates. The only reason to release no info at all is if you know your excuse is a bad one and you will get judged for it. Even then that might be better than all the speculation going on now.
hm7314y,__v1ce,11/26/2021,1,24.0,tfw tank abusers have literally one counter
hm7lm7w,danielloking_,11/26/2021,1,205.0,I suspect an American who once again has no idea what theyre talking about when it comes to Europe.   I occasionally play on EUNE and most of the people playing on that server write in (scuffed) English just like EUW.   Im not saying English is a common language in any of the countries part of EUNE in fact apart from England Ireland Scottland etc. no country in Europe has English as its most common language. Europeans just tend to speak multiple language due to good education and English is pretty much mandatory in most European countries.
hm8q53s,Miyaor,11/26/2021,1,5.0,Apparently just landed

hm7ue6r,curiouscuriousmtl,11/26/2021,1,120.0,The day I heard from Riot August that the designers are actually coding their champions in what sounds like some kind of scripting language was the day I realized this whole thing must be a complete mess.

hm7u284,KonaKonaChan,11/26/2021,1,17.0,Could you go a little more in-depth as to why you think that the order is like that? Many people (i.e. Dopa) say that climbing with support is the easiest role since it requires less mechanical skill. Do you think that is not the case?

hm7us9y,IAmDaleicious,11/26/2021,1,52.0,Longevity. Huge champion pool. Similar but maybe slightly lower peak than TheShy. Even though Ssumday was good Smeb was clearly the best top in KR from 15-17 and again top three in 18.  Btw adding CuVee just detracts from your argument.
hm73kpc,KvotheM,11/26/2021,1,42.0,Out of curiosity what do you think is misogynistic about what I said? Because everything would stay the same if the genders were reversed.

hm6z0k0,Ozianin_,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,The thing with Alphari is imo justified. Thats just how team enviroment work. However I dont like how Upset approached Adam about it. This quote with you are not up to my ambitions was unnecessary.
hm6y6rz,DekoGG,11/26/2021,1,108.0,He doesnt want to improve its that simple lol Hes bad at the game and refuses to learn why hes bad and whats the big difference from someone whos good vs him.

hm74zbr,baburu12,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,>Over the course of two weeks there were two meetings where I had expressed to the team that I was dealing with severe family issues that have impacted me deeply   which then begs the question why didnt bean get any split scrim time in those two weeks. In any company if you tell someone two weeks before the project is due that you are dealing with severe issues at home management either gives you a backup coworker or replaces you from the project because the company cant risk a project failing completely because of your issues. either fnatic coaching and management is kinda incompetent or he didnt express the issue as clearly to everyone given that all other players so far mentioned they only found out the night before.  The fact that the whole team knew two weeks prior to him leaving that he has severe issues at home put the coaching and management of fnatic in a very bad light and splits the responsibility between them and upset. As manager or coach you have to make sure that the team succeeds regardless of the issues of only one player. Any responsible coaching staff or management would have given bean some scrim time as a backup measure.  Truth be told this confirms one of my strong suspicions which has been downvoted into oblivion that the issue at home wasnt quite out of the blue and that fnatic knew about it before worlds started given that the only substitute player they brought to worlds was an adc substitute which at the time didnt make any sense since botlane was the strongest fnatic lane and the sub should be for one of the weaker roles most likely mid or topside or if fnatic managements knew about bwipos gf issue for the jungler role. Which makes the situation look even more mindblowingly incompetent from a management position: you know one of your top players has severe issues at home and can leave at any moment you bring a replacement for him but you never give the replacement any time with the team? Like wtf. Bean started looking good starting in the second worlds game. Maybe with appropriate scrim time fnatics situation at words could have looked differently.
hm7f17w,the-lonely-corki,11/26/2021,1,144.0,Sad jizz mans gone his play style always ate low confidence players alive and was good at exposing players who always played for losing lane and showing up for team fights

Can you imagine working on some project you work for a whole year and on the last stage you just go - I have a family emergency and go. No nothing. Coz the people you have worked with mean nothing to you. Bro this is not the normal way...
hm844ki,Dhrnt,11/26/2021,1,39.0,Or he develops a different version Silco said shimmer production is already halfway shut down. To me that suggests he had a replacement product coming via whatever the main ingredient of the Insanity Potion will be.

hm75x2f,matteosagwa,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Its not Upsets fault that Nisqy didnt go to C9. Nisqy played well hummanoid played better. Its an upgrade for fnatic   Nisqy ran it down at worlds yeah it sucks that Upset had to leave...but he did.

Which is 99% of all times just RNG when you solo play.  If you want perfect matches then League is not it. Its either becoming pro or just playing actual good games that have a singleplayer focus

hm7d88l,Jonoabbo,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,I genuinely dont get what you want. Adam is a good player I think he had a good split but when the choice is Adam or Wunder/Alphari of course people are going to want the latter.  Do you want him to advise his team to choose a worse roster and sabotage his own org?
hm7plzm,fornostalone,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,You can trust people within a team to do the necessary things to win but not trust them as people outside the game/team.   Bwipo has proven to be an emotional person prone to talking publicly about things he shouldnt repeatedly.  Upset had known Adam for what a year? I wouldnt trust a coworker of a year with the secrets of my family let alone one that (after the fact) has again proven himself to be an emotional person.   Even if they dont leak the information immediately people will continue to ask them what happened to that worlds run. They go to a new team people ask wtf was up. They hint and allude and eventually people piece together the story and it leaks out.   Upset handedly his family secrets completely correctly in my opinion but him & FNC management should have prepared for the worst earlier and split scrim time with Bean from the outset.
hm7b7vf,sukazu,11/26/2021,1,115.0,Balance my friend           If the goal is to improve you should definitly have sessions where you try to not die and focus on csing / map movements      And some sessions where you limit test      It doesnt matter that youll lose more in short term.       If the goal is to climb you should play agressive if youre significantly better than the elo youre playing in     Or passive if similar.  Reducing potential errors and not tilting will get you further than trying to outplay peoples of similar level.

hm8fn8o,SkeleknighX,11/26/2021,1,169.0,With respect I really don’t think this is true at all. It feels like ANYONE is capable of being better they just need the right resources (assuming everyone has access to a decent connection+computer which might be pretty presumptuous of me).  But with lots of time and the right learning mindset anyone can be at the top of the latter.

hm7lb5k,amroth6464,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,well if you read all the tweetlongers youll understand that Upset told them.  For 2 weeks before leaving he told them his family was living some serious crisis. 12hours before world something happened and he left telling everyone he have grave family issues explained to fnatic staff then left.  He then wrote a tweet explaining he has serious family issues and had to left.  The only thing he didnt say was if it was about miscarriage cancer attempt suicide or whatever shit may have happen to his family. And why would he ?  Youre just all pissed because you dont know about the morbid details of his family situation. So does Adam. But did he know it was serious ? yes.  why the fuck would he believe him more if Upset was saying his wife had a miscarriage ? He already doesnt believe him when he says its a serious matter. What difference would it make about this ? I mean outside of satisfying his own curiosity ?

hm8mul1,EvyLuna,11/26/2021,1,165.0,Ive heard it described as the difference between Iron and D4 is the same as the gap between D4 and D1 which is the same as the gap between D1 and Grandmaster.  You can get to D4 without learning all the ins and outs of the game. People get to Plat without thinking anything through beyond the next 30 seconds. You start needing to actually learn the depth of the game somewhere in Diamond and how well you do that is a huge factor in how high youll climb assuming the player isnt held back by mechanics.

hm80ynv,bns18js,11/26/2021,1,55.0,> Ive been challenger for 5 seasons now.  Here is the answer. OP is a long time challenger someone who is extremely good and much better than barely getting to masters. He is **practically smurfing** on his way to masters. So really he is just saying support takes the longest to get there with his very specific situation which makes sense because its hard to completely 1v9 smurf on support champions no matter how much better you are.   Which OP basically said by explaining in another post---  >Being a support that is significantly better than everyone else in the game is not going to have as much of an impact when comparing it to any other role.  But for someone playing at their absolute peak the situation is completely different. This is what DOPA is talking about. For people playing at their peak level trying to climb support is the easiest because it requires less skill especially mechanical. So for someone who is limited by their own abilities support is the path of least resistance and would allow people to get to a higher ranking than otherwise possible with anything else. This is what people call elo inflated and it is largely accurate.  **TLDR**: Its hard to completely 1v9 as support when youre playing at a skill level below you like what OP is doing. But if youre limited by your abilities at your peak support demands the least amount of of skill and therefore is still the easiest. DOPA is not wrong.

hmbsqux,00Dandy,11/27/2021,1,,The thing is LoL isnt very accessible. It might by f2p and works on most PCs but its a very complex game that can be difficult for new players to get into.   According to [this site](https://leaguefeed.net/did-you-know-total-league-of-legends-player-count-updated/) it has around 120 million active monthly players and Riot recently even reported 180 million active monthly players across all Runeterra games but the vast majority of those are in LoL. Minecraft has more players but its also available on almost every platform.   My point is how can a game with 120 million active players not be good?

hmc9svz,TheSoupKitchen,11/27/2021,1,406.0,Crit itemization is arguably the worst its ever been. IE doesnt give as much damage as it used to and Crit items only give 20% crit. Im sorry youre so troubled by this that you cannot look into the past history of the game more than 1 year ago. But the role isnt in a great state. Also keep spewing VICTIM COMPLEX when I literally said bruisers have similar issues this season and youre more than welcome to complain about it but this is a thread and comment chain about ADCs and lethal tempo so I was giving my thoughts on that.

hmb33ek,LoLrovex,11/27/2021,1,,its sad to see people with chinese Igns get absolutely torn in chat. However in high elo chinese players have an EXTREMELY bad reputation so the majority people will have a negative connotation of them before interacting with them once. At the end of the day though EVERYONE is still an individual and should be treated as one. So ye. Sad.
hm93r78,TriHardCx12345,11/27/2021,1,219.0,how to carry in silver/gold when your bot lane loses both towers and are 0/10 while your struggling to get mid tower vs a heavy wave clear long range champ! :)
hmb9qkp,neverspeakofme,11/27/2021,1,125.0,I think the statistic here is not sufficient to conclude the point you are making.  The stat might be high because the team with soul is USUALLY also ahead in gold in other words the type of soul is not the reason for the high win %.  Look at it this way. Hypothetically the team which is in a position to get 4 drakes may already have a 75% chance of winning if they choose not to take the drake. Taking any soul raises it to 86% so 10%+ higher. But taking chemtech raises it to 91% so 15% higher. Chemtech soul increases winrate by 50% more.  To look at it another way the losing team has 50% higher chance to come back if the soul was anything other than a chemtech soul.
hmazson,lilcwis,11/27/2021,1,157.0,You heard of shaco before?

hmanemz,HazelCheese,11/27/2021,1,11.0,I cant ignore a point the video failed to make.  Axiom Arc is an item you buy when your winning and you want to throw away your lead by wasting gold instead of investing it in good items.  All it did in this video was help Pyke secure a kill he could of gotten faster if he had spent the 3000 gold on a better item instead.  The only champion who really gets a lot of mileage out of Axiom Arc is Nocturne.
hmcts5e,GabrielP2r,11/27/2021,1,78.0,Brazil got Bowser Rammus if you transfered from NA
hma0tk7,delahunt,11/27/2021,1,12378.0,One of the people who worked on Arcane talked about this on twitter. Vi/Cait arrive at Caits house in the morning. Theyre both battered/bruised/exhausted/frayed. They dont present to the council until that night. What happens in between - that then leads Cait to do the what about us? line - is up to the viewer (they wouldnt go into season 2 spoilers.)  Someone else pointed out Cait does her thinking in the shower and the shower is where she is remembering Vi and the lost relationship so maybe they had a shower together off screen?  Unfortunately with Tencent owning Riot the China market being a huge target and how expensive animation is it is unlikely we get anything explicit on show to cement a Cait/Vi relationship either way.
hmcsanh,LARXXX,11/27/2021,1,47.0,Sett would boom Vi in a boxing match and in the bedroom.
hmc4ujg,roadnot_taken,11/27/2021,1,373.0,Incorrect. Plenty of champions have historically been banned about because at a certain winrate like 55% and a high enough pick rate youll almost always lose to that champ. Ive been around since beta Ive seen champs hit 90% ban rates.  Youre basically saying the data doesnt mean anything to you because you dont understand how its applied.

hm8vl8y,voltairelol,11/27/2021,1,12.0,Each team has about 2 current pros (Olive and DL (lul) Bwipo and Core Danny and Blaber Spica and Tactical) 1 older academy player (Diamond Armao Zeyzal and Dhokla) and 2 young players (Will and GS Darkwings and Yeon RJS and Srrty and Spirax and Breezy).  Not sure how this is so unbalanced. I think DL is comparable to a lot of current pros so I put him in there and it fits perfectly. Also I assumed players Im not very familiar with are young a couple of them might be old washed players but that probably puts them close to young academy players who have little to no experience.

hmc6dzm,UNOvven,11/27/2021,1,91.0,Its not. Its probably the worst second item you could go for on Kha. Your ult is nice yes but you lose a lot of damage and roaming potential by not going for Youmuus and you barely even get more ults. Its at most an item I coudl see myself buying *IF* Im already winning which I assume could inflate its stats (I havent checked those in a while) but the item isnt good.

(I dont know what your internal stats are saying). But they are fucking great. For such a small scope pre-season it really feels nice. Well done to the team :D

hmbh1im,Head_Haunter,11/27/2021,1,303.0,Vayne is benefiting from the objective bounty system thats why her winrate is increasing. She gets a lot of free gold from objective bounties that helps her survive mid-game.   Caitlyn winrate actually went down with the new patch but that might also be because Riot accidentally removed like her only advanced combo - her headshot auto-cancel.  Riot already addressed this and are planning to fix (or already fixed Im not sure).

hmcegz2,Oreo-and-Fly,11/27/2021,1,102.0,This.   Axioms best use is not in teamfights. But rather the uptime that youll always have your ult in a 1v1.    I read another that said its good for roaming assassins who need their ult to kill aka Talon or Zed. So they have more chances to use it than not.   If youre getting 3 kills within 3 seconds each on an assassin in a teamfight where teamfights arent assassins greatest strength your team is already too far ahead and will win with or without it.

hmcccow,IainG10,11/27/2021,1,41.0,My take is that League is a good game (I may not like some of the balance decisions towards faster games but I understand them) its the community that ruins a lot of the experience. Not just the flaming and occasional full on trolling but the FF go next mentality that is rife in Ranked and the Play meta or suffer mentality in Normals.

I highly recommend checking out Spica or Blabers VoD from last night and Blabers stream from tomorrow at 8est. Youll get comms and some decision making.  From what I saw it seemed like junglers were playing more for their team than season 11 and definitely playing towards objectives more. I could be wrong though.

hmagsxv,hahanowaitbutyes,11/27/2021,1,116.0,100 range on an adc who already has a shit ton of range is worth a lot more than 50 range on someone who is trying to be on top of you. just because the rune is pathetic on ads comparatively doesn’t mean the range is suddenly better for the jax or irelia leaping on you range is exponentially better the more you have not the other way around. just look at urgot he is basically a melee champion in ranged matchups.

hm9k2ru,Shadowstep_kick,11/27/2021,1,52.0,>Well it def is better for ME which is enough reason for ME to take it.  Im stupid and obtuse  >It didnt get buffed single time. Tbh one specific build was intended for Fiora but was built on Camille... But it wasnt buffed in meanwhile and they used to run almost same items. Even now they kinda do this whole mythic items thing kinda makes them build diff items.  Im stupid and obtuse and dont check patch notes.  >I am spell AA based assassin. Rengar builds crit. And guess what? AAing enemies with crit items hurts them.  Rengar builds *maybe* one crit item and he doesnt build it for the crit. Crit is an objectively bad stat on rengar. It performs poorly. This isnt debatable. Its in the stats. Just because Dekar can build full ap and win games doesnt make it the optimal strategy. You cant take suboptimal items/runes and win a game and then go Oh it works I won a game! Thats called anecdotal evidence.   Rengar has auto attacks and he builds attack damage. This doesnt inherently make him an aa based assassin. Talon is not an auto attack based carry. Riven is not an auto attack based carry. Zed is not an auto attack based carry. **Rengar is not an auto attack based carry.** If you actually play correctly most of your damage comes from your abilities because landing multiple auto attacks is never reliable. Because its dogshit. Melee range auto attack carries have to have an incredibly strong and persistent survival tool or they get nuked from fucking orbit. Master Yi Q. Viego reset. Having one empowered W does not protect you enough.   Were not arguing about what works for you. Were arguing about what is best. HoB. is. trash. I dont even have to say HoB is trash *on rengar* its just fucking trash on its own. Its only playable on like kalista twitch tryndamere. You saying its viable on rengar is exactly as respectable as that cheese HoB darius strat that was going around 2 years ago. If it ever wins it wins because the person youre playing against doesnt even know what the rune does and cant play/adapt around it.  Bro you dont even know what a fallacy is. Rengar being a 0 impact character if youre not capable of oneshotting at least one person on the other team is just a fact. You dont have to worry about the tanks. Youre rengar. Theyre not your job.   This was a fun way to spend the last 10 minutes of my shift tonight but Im not going to come back and give you any more free elo again. You can either choose to stick to what you think is best or accept that sometimes its better to let go of your ego and look towards what actually works. All that being said I dont give a shit how you choose to play your games but dont come into a public forum and mislead people who dont know better with your home-stirred-shit-soup builds.  Have a great day!!  -- wow I shouldnt have even spent the time typing this out scrolled up and seent you talking about the triple q combo... which hasnt been possible for YEARS. You dont even play the game anymore LMAO!

hmcbw3b,Angry---train,11/27/2021,1,405.0,>Notice how half of the champs I mentionned have a (or multiple) form of CC or ways to absorb burst / go through peeling not even including all the forms of tenacity they can get in their builds easily.  Which is giga worthless due to how enormous the CC creep is  >If CC and peel were that much of an issue for them they wouldnt have appeared at Worlds given how much CC and peel Worlds team draft. So you can imagine solo Q where theres barely any peel and sometimes CC.  They either never showed up or performed like complete ass due to the fact that theres so much CC and peelespecially in competitive play
hma6d5n,tanezuki,11/27/2021,1,76.0,Is there any juggernaut that reliably builds this ? Im checking on Lolalytics right now and Im not seeing these items being popular amongst any of them.   Exact item count and then checking the items in build order.   The only outlier Ive seen so far is Garen who has for popular build Mortal Reminder. So entirely different in itself.

hmbtrz1,rmbar19,11/27/2021,1,55.0,I think this is a false dilemma that Riot has set up and youre speaking about. You acting as though its either damage is higher than defense which MUST lead to tanks feeling like butter in late game OR we allow for tanks to have obscene defense so you can NEVER kill them and it becomes a stalemate.  ...Youre telling me there isnt a third middle ground? Give them some more defense. Enough that in the late game they wont just melt like butter so they can actually initiate a teamfight without immediately running away from the incoming damage. NOT unkillable but the DPS and particularly any burst damage should think twice before blowing their rotation on the tank instead of saying hey look a target! \\Im not asking for them to be able to heal up during a fight much if at all (at least for tanks bruisers work differently). Just do their job effectively. Reduce their damage output (tanks dont care about damage) in return. Make them the nigh-invulnerable CC machines theyre supposed to be not slightly durable CC deathballs they are now.  I get your point about them shining in the mid game but I dont think that justifies them feeling damn worthless in the late game. Like when Im playing a juggernaut and I know I can roll anyone 1 vs 1 the ADC who is going to outscale me still isnt helpless. He can poke me down if Im not careful clear waves etc. He may not be capable of 1 vs 1 me at the moment but they arent useless. Which is essentially how it feels building beefy-once you hit a certain point building anything else feels irrelevant.  Im not advocating for tanks and bruisers to rule late game that should stay with ADCs and other certain champsions like Kass who are meant to scale hard into late game. But I would like to feel like I can still contribute something with my bulkiness since I literally spent most if not all of my gold trying to stop myself from dying to them.

If you get asked if you want the Adam or Alphari in your team especially if you played with both of them before i would choose alphari also. You would be stupid to chose adam above alphari.

hmbdhst,GDSBCM,11/27/2021,1,,They should have made new accounts. I believe the system just throws you into a smurf queue or just matches you into more experienced players if you queue with your friends pre-existing accounts. Everytime Ive tried to get a new friend into the game I create a new account to teach them the game properly. If similar to my experience your account is a bit scuffed now until you get placed in Ranked.  Basically system expects your friends to carry your games meanwhile you get to eat dirt.

hma7tid,falkner97,11/27/2021,1,145.0,like idgaf about the situation  upset can choose whether to tell the public or the fans thats his privacy to do so  but if he can choose to tell hyli and choose not to tell the rest of the team  something is wrong somewhere  in a normal setting nobody would give a fk whether he leaves his team or what  but during worlds where every single fan and even some of the public are looking at the competition  this is very shitty to do to his teammates  now FNC and the players get made into a laughing joke and i bet that this would affect them not just from their mental even their pay and buyouts would be affected considering their performance at worlds this year  and again this is not something yamato can decide for his team nor should anyone be able to tell the teammates that hey you should just accept this shitty situation

hm9pxa8,OnFallenWings,11/27/2021,1,26.0,Yeah mate I dont get to play this game more than a couple of hours. I really think your mentality applies to people who have loads of spare time and arent doing long shifts 6 days a week.  Pretending this is about always winning is just bullshit. If you had limited time to play too you wouldnt want to be stuck in a game with somebody flaming and wasting your time. Sometimes that 10 minutes is the difference between getting another game in and not being able too. Sure you lose .1% winrate if you ff early but you get to play more games which means you actually have a chance to climb. Its actually optimal with limited time so dont give me this winners mentality shite.
hm9a67y,ConscienceNot,11/27/2021,1,45.0,I dont really fkin care about one specific person. In past I was told that my build sucks just for it to be then either meta or picked at pro stage. Yes literally that happened.
hm9d8jp,BagelJ,11/27/2021,1,14.0,Yeah it should absolutely break tos (as in if it doesnt ToS should be changed).   Imagine how different the game would be if everyone had 3rd party timers for other stuff.  Not even the best players in the world can time 10 summoners and 9 ultimates down to the second something a 3rd party program could achieve.    Hell why stop there. Time everything.
hmb9pa7,Rodniconii,11/27/2021,1,83.0,Sol shouldve answered that but it was a rushed trash event that was plagued with plot holes.
hmbbedw,yasuud,11/27/2021,1,263.0,The nerf may not have exclusively been for ranged users but it was targeted mainly at marksmen using it here’s riots blurb on that nerf:    “Hail of Blades has risen in prominence among marksmen providing quick trades with a high uptime compared to other runes. We’re sharpening its intended weakness as a front-loaded skirmish tool by increasing its cooldown.”
hma6up0,Mucky_Rucky,11/27/2021,1,7.0,You have one of two options:  1.) Continue to snowball your lane go for solo kills or constantly shove down you opponent while minding the river for ganks. Doing this your lane will constantly be pushed in so you can to for objectives and make it back to your lane in time to catch the wave or miss a few cs since your opponent was pushed in so far.   2.) Lame it out and freeze your wave at your turret. This will cause your opponent to over extend past river if the want xp and gold setting up your jungler for easy ganks. Once that happens HARD shove that wave into turret and either recall or look for a TP play then start the process all over again.   But like the others have said it is very grey and it sounds like you need some more experience playing and learning the game and all the different scenarios on what gives you the highest probability of success since there are many right answers just choosing the best one for the situation.  But experiment out with the two above and learn to adapt from there.

hmbey65,GoatRocketeer,11/27/2021,1,154.0,I think it was a pro play thing.  The revive let him frontline extremely well for a champion that doesnt get shit on in lane like most tanks do. Both passable laning and frontlining are a lot more powerful in pro than they are for the regular playerbase so I assume they removed the revive to prevent another azir/ryze/release rakan/release ornn problem.

hm925pq,WintersEnvoy,11/27/2021,1,183.0,When you play as much as 8 games a day for 95 % of people that time is mostly autopilot the trick is ofc making sure youre actually good at autopiloting which requires you to be focused and try your hardest for long periods of time  (e.g same way studying and work is mostly automated IRL its just how our brains work but if you do that and ONLY that nothings ever going to change just static no improvement)  Even for a pro youre autopiloting certain parts of the game so your brain doesnt collapse from stress or madness like csing is something that should eventually become effortless (for the most part and some unique adjustments will be made a few times every game) but if its effortlessly bad and you never seek to improve it your gameplay suffers heavily from it.  &#x200B  That said theres always that argument the playerbase is always getting better you only raise your rank relatively with skill improvement when you improve your skill faster than other people in your old rank. At least to a large extent gold players now can be really decent at understanding how to lane plats most definitely (some not all) but tend to collapse in how to play after 15 minutes. Theres not the sligthest doubt that bronze players s5 were utter garbage compared to bronze players s11 so theres probably been some improvement just not enough compared to most other people lol

hmb55yz,Cpt_Cosmo,11/27/2021,1,530.0,Im still expecting 2024 as the earliest at least if they want to keep the same quality. Animation so detailed and high quality with so many constantly moving parts as this first season will take a long time regardless of how many people you have working on it.  Like its one thing if its just a randomly put together collection of different animation sequences but a show has to be cohesive so the scenes have to pass through multiple workers constantly.

hma64sh,Spitfire836,11/27/2021,1,71.0,This is the trend since S11 started. Intend to make something good for ADCs but actually good on melee instead.

hm9rnwv,Batman_NEU19,11/27/2021,1,30.0,Don’t disagree with you to an extent but to say the range is super broken is a little bit misleading. Only a few adcs have the range to safely stack lethal in order to get the bonus range (Cait kog jinx maybe aphelios twitch with r come to mind off hand). A champ like twitch would like to have max AS from the rune throughout his ulti like the old rune provided. Overall I think it is mostly a nerf to the rune for adcs and HoB is better in most instances as the attack speed rune which is contrary to what riot supposedly intended. And with it being so powerful on melee bruisers that amounts to an incidental nerf of sorts on everyone else that has to deal with them. We’ll have to see what riot does throughout preseason on it but in its current state and given riots balance history I’m not optimistic that it will be changed in a manner that actually benefits adcs.

I remember being unable to see the camo range while in the fog at some point)
hmb8i6o,CantReadGood_,11/27/2021,1,196.0,Not sure why hextech/chemtech can’t also be interpreted as foundational or just more recent manifestations of magic in the developing world…  Also unsure why you’d insist on pigeonholing runeterra into traditional fantasy tropes? Like it really doesn’t matter what foundational elements you’re used to. The periodic table was just an example of that. Elements in one world (our modern world) might not be the same as elements in other worlds (fiction or older human history). They could pull out completely different stuff that you’d just have to accept because this is fiction and you’re not the loremaster and it’s fine for both the world itself and the knowledge of those in the world to evolve.

We arent playing bloodmoon mode. There are targets that wont get oneshotted on two autos and there is higher chance that target gonna get overkilled on two AAs and the same applies that he wouldnt die to small electro damage if he doesnt die in two AAs.  Also I can say: I am not behind I am just killing multiple targets which is also a thing where HoB is way better than electro.  Pull ur head out of ur ass.

Caitlyn really felt only slightly interested romantically her naive nature suggests she already sees Vi as a partner but not quite yet as a \*partner\* (though shes clearly interested shes not as latched on as Vi is.  Which makes sense Vi was in prison for like 10 years and heres Cait to bust her out and be nice to her in spite of Vis suspicions).  Of course this was season one.  We have time to go further with this in season two.  And while they didnt make Caitlyn explicit in season one the ship is popular enough that I fully expect at least a kiss at some point in season two.
hm9psts,Dan5000,11/27/2021,1,419.0,i think everyone dislikes their own language in chat. its an online game everyone wants to understand what youre saying. talk in english or shut it. i am german and if i read german i even answer in english if its important otherwise ill ignore it. i always cringe at any other language in gamechats.
hmar6xv,DigBickBroly,11/27/2021,1,138.0,Super team nowadays just means A strong looking team that *might* win a lot for a lot of people. Its why VIT TL or the BLG team that no one actually knows how itll look like are called super teams too even though the true super teams from the past like 2017 KT were much much stronger on paper.

hm9pybk,Mantias,11/27/2021,1,63.0,He’s quite clearly saying that when performing at his current peak 369 is one of the best carries not that he is currently one of the best carries consistently. JDG would likely be investing in him with the hope that he begins to perform at that level more consistently with experience as he is currently still a young player.

As for getting better experience is obviously the largest thing over time youll learn the ins and outs of each champion and how to play scenarios.

hm9803b,liamera,11/27/2021,1,34.0,Tons of champions have upward or downward swings with patches. I was hoping OP would have some ideas for why these changes happened particularly with maybe referencing the new items or game changes such as the new comeback mechanics introduced or the new dragons instead of just strawmanning with why do people consider vayne balanced.   OP mentioning kraken slayer silver bolts and saying it seems like without even citing the winrate they are supposedly upset about indicates to me that OP hasnt given the topic much thought themselves aside from recent anecdotal experience.

And even when numbers are against them they still keep the unpopular stuff in the game because theyre so stubborn and think they know better than the players - just look at season 6 and dynamic queue.

hmacbga,Joatorino,11/27/2021,1,83.0,Pta and hob were never nerfed for ranged and fleet got giga nerfed for melees last time they changed. Now it actually requires some skill instead of just being more lane sustain and its pretty good on ranged if you hit champions when you have the energized proc. Only rune that was nerfed for rangeds is conqueror which was never really a good choice on adcs

Their a lot of issus with the game atm but tank are not one of them.

hma932d,ADeadMansName,11/27/2021,1,3976.0,How was an entire year of work thrown away? He worked mostly to improve. And it was not like Adam or Bwipo or anyone on FNC had really tried their best to still make it. They were mentally totally destroyed when they actually had a decent chance with Bean to make it further.  So saying it was just Upset and not also a problem with the rest of the team ignored their whole performance.  FNCs goal that year wasnt to win worlds that was nearly impossible. They likely could have made semis with Upset if everything went well and with Bean quarterfinals if everything went well. Not like Upset leaving was removing everything. Not like Upset leaving removed everything they learned together that year.  It did stipp them from a better chance of a higher placement at worlds that is all.  And I dont wonder why he is pissed. But shit happens. You think Upset wanted to have an emergency? You cant blame Upset for that. Shit happened happens all the time move on after letting it out. But dont be pissed random people. Yes it is human like but it is also wrong.

hmc5hwm,SketchThePhate,11/27/2021,1,3.0,Honestly support is more about the items you build. Shurelyas Locket Moonstone if youre playing a healing champ.   What makes a support effective is how well they can trade to help get the adc kills as well as working to keep them alive taking a bullet for them if you need to so that they can keep farming. So tanks work well anything with cc healers/shielders etc.

hmb0ct5,Arkaidan8,11/27/2021,1,,Needed nerfs? sure. Did it need to have its dash removed and its speed halved? No.  They couldve kept the mspeed or they couldve removed the slow/nerfed the mspeed/increased the cooldown or lowered the range on the dash reverting it back to 150 units on a 40s of cooldown or something like that.  Right now its absolutely trash and it serves no purpose even Sett/Darius/Garen the most synregistic champions in the game often build something else (Trinity Gore...)

Definitely for me Ive also experienced that and have always been hoping that the community becomes better in terms of just showing respect even when people make mistakes in the game. If you really want to keep playing  the game go for it but I really recommend muting all so you can enjoy the game without anyone telling you did something wrong. This can help you improve your game too! However if you feel the toxicity is too much and trust me Iv been there Its just best to leave the game and find something where you wont be exposed to constant toxicity. What I do is I dont play the game anymore but I still enjoy watching streamers play and keep up with news like on Reddit. Whatever you decide good luck my dude and dont let toxicity get you down. Stay strong brother

Esports is 100% a job and while its not in his contract like all jobs reputation is important and if u have a reputation of being difficult u can cut ur career short if u start to slump because now u dont communicate and ur playing mediocre.

hm9zk5z,AliasTcherki,11/27/2021,1,25.0,Honestly I think that it would be best if everyone just agreed to disagree.   Some people (Im part of those) think that Upset is in his right to not share what happened: he shared that something was going on that it deeply affected him and that he needed to take care of his loved ones. Unlike what Doublelift says a team is not a brotherhood. Reaching that state is extraordinary for the very reason that its rare. Making so that you have both a super good team with excellent players and that those players all match together on a personnal / intimate level happens super rarely. Therefore its understandable that Upset doesnt want to go further in details to his other teammates.   On the other hand some people (like DL) think that being in a professional team whos number one priority is winning Worlds goes over that. That you need to at least partially give up on that right and submit to the judgement of your teammates to whether or not it was a good enough reason (honestly I really disagree with that but I seriously understand where it could come from considering the stakes that are at hands here).      Yet there is one thing above all of this which is to go public in a TL. And on that point I stricly disagree. You dont go public on such things and start a wave of hate on a former teammate (and Im not saying that Adam did it on purpose but thats still his responsability)
hm9di5z,Rustifer66642069,11/27/2021,1,27.0,Yes.
hma1ycm,HoouueeaaH,11/27/2021,1,25.0,In the end if Upset didnt feel like playing thats all that matters no? now everyone knows hes not the kind of guy who grind during hard times and everyone in the industry knows and can act accordingly by deciding to join a team with him or not. We cant all be Doublelift Leclerc or whatever example of strong will you can have.

hmb6f2r,ArchdevilTeemo,11/27/2021,1,38.0,LoL is one of the most played online games because you can play it all the time and it never gets old because there is no story finale or max level.   Just like fortnite & minecraft - other very popular games.  LoL is also so popular because its a game everybody can play. Its F2P and even runs on shitty notebooks.   The best story game will never be more popular than big f2p mmos. Its just not possible.
hm95icd,alajet,11/27/2021,1,30.0,369 is still 20 and at his best performance one of the best carries in the league. If JDG are rebuilding he is one of the better pieces they can get back in exchange for their veteran top laner.

Tempo might be a good pick into a hurricane game where you know your lane is gonna suck anyway or is entirely dependent on supports (the rune **does** feel great with hurricane) and I can see it gaining a little more traction if you can red q your way into the ranged steroid but the one game I messed with it with lethality I felt really weak.

hmb2u1b,Chivibro,11/27/2021,1,8.0,You can party up with people and hope someone gets an S. Getting an S will get you chests which can have champion shards. Buting champions from Champion Shards will be cheaper than buting them from the store. Also you can Disenchant shards to get BE from them. Itll take a little while but thats the best way to get BE atm.  There are events that happen every once in a while that have Tokens and come with their own little shops. In those shops you can always buy Champ Shards and itll be guaranteed to be a decently priced one. Those Champ Shards are by far the best way to get BE
hmb5yes,Chokkitu,11/27/2021,1,,ASol?  Technically Ryze since Runeterra would be wildly different if he didnt collect the World Runes. Or Jayce/Viktor since they invented Hextech which affected almost all Piltover/Zaun champions.  Edit: LeBlanc killed Mordekaiser which led to the foundation of Noxus which means shes affected all Noxian and Ionian champions a couple of Shuriman/Demacian ones (like Jarvan Xin Zhao Samira and Taliyah) Alistar Urgot Veigar and Vladimir off the top of my head. Technically she influenced Azir too since Cassiopeia is Noxian and her stabbing Sivirs back is part of the reason why Azir came back which means shes affected all of Shurima as well.

hmbz8a2,TheUItimateBlip,11/27/2021,1,263.0,Something that fits in fantasy  Speaking of a world where people with rockets fight pirats fight swordsmen fight aliens fight magic space dragon. Runeterra is much but for sure not classic fantasy. Im no expert but either way they used elemental dragons just as good way to sum them up. its not like there was a rule behind it that made sense within lol lore.     Edit: Also maybe Im in the minority. But the thought of a dead-reborn dragon through Piltovers/Zhaun inventions sounds like an interesting concept at some point in the story. Noxus for sure would buy some of these :P

I dont get the adc hate in the comments here the position is the weakest of all 5 atm. Even if you snowball early the enemy top with average farm can still shut you down in seconds in the midgame. As a top main I feel like it doesnt matter if my botlane gets stomped if the enemy ADC doesnt have 10++ kills and perfect farm in the midgame I just kill them over and over (lul).

hm9b4o1,nanithefucketh,11/27/2021,1,238.0,Whats the most important thing to help you climb as a midlaner? And what are some of the champions you came across a lot?
hmavyuj,ColdXStrikeR,11/27/2021,1,65.0,Well obviously that kind of scaling comps have decreased. But also think about it this way the best champions over the last couple of seasons have been champs that either ignore items and spike out of their mins no matter what at a certain lvl or champs that spike at 1 at the very most 2 items. If you need 3 items to play the game you are barely a champion. Thats why they invented mythics get 1 item for your large power and a legendary item to supplement that and you done.  Also on a somewhat related topic the logic of well if you are far enough ahead you should be able to secure the drake and win the game. So what if you arent. You are barely ahead like one teamfight win ahead of the enemy team and its soul time and you know if they get the drake (its 3 each) they get something busted like the chemtech soul. And they end up getting it cuz of some lucky smite or w/e and they end up winning the game. That used to be a wincondition for elder drake but if its hex soul its a whole 6 mins earlier in the game you need to go all in.  Idk I just dont like those all in mechanics. + its a dumb argument tonsay if you are far enough ahead you should have a clear way of winning. Bitch if you are far enough ahead to be able to secure a soul/elder without trouble you are also far enough ahead to march down enemy base and win the game.  Idk its all this 1 way logics I have a problem with if I am gonna be real.
hmasygt,jayquanderulo,11/27/2021,1,10.0,There will always be people telling you how bad you are. Just like when you watch the pro’s stream and yell at Diamond and Masters players.   Everyone is constantly making mistakes in the game they just like to hyper focus on others. Just mute people and play the game. It seriously feels way better.

hmau4il,TokaiTeio0420,11/27/2021,1,106.0,I dont get the reason they call it Novembers capsule and make it available from 11/30 to 12/30. I mean there is a much better way for them and for the players for example i would have preferred the case they called it Decembers capsule and made it available to claim on 11/30 so people would say Riot is the best company in the world.  They could start with the first capsule been available on the 30th of October and call it Novembers capsule and then give this second one on 30th of November and call it Decembers capsule.  Nothing actually changes to them but the public opinion would have been much different![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)

hmaust9,andrewboss1222,11/27/2021,1,170.0,There is a reason theres alot of items that dont give the same benefit on ranged users as they do on melee users for example. Being melee means you have a harder time being able to proc the effects. For example grasp is 40 percent effective overall on ranged champs heroic gait from that one axe 1100 gold item that gives you movement speed on hits is half as effective on ranged tempo is rebalanced on ranged etc. Being ranged is a massive strength that needs to be overall balanced by having ranged champs be squishier and on stuff they can proc easier have it be less effective.

hmb6dpx,VeritasCicero,11/27/2021,1,197.0,According to lore hextech and chemtech is derived through hybridization of magic and tech. So thats why.   The 5 elements are an old description of the observable foundations of the natural world. Something that fits in fantasy.   The periodic table is chemical elements. Not the same thing.
hm9ftsp,GunnerPup13,11/27/2021,1,17.0,I had to quit after a while because as a new player the community was just way too toxic. I was brand new to the game trying to learn and people called me a garbage mid because I can’t be in two places at once. If top needed help I’d go over there and assist then bottom would immediately call me trash. Try to help bottom and they’d get mad because I was helping too much. I just couldn’t find a middle ground that worked. All I wanted to do was enjoy a game with my girlfriend at the time. Couldn’t even enjoy a brand new game.   I’ll be the first to tell you I suck at the game but I found my happy place as a mid. I would mostly run Shivana and loved the artwork and creativity of the characters and the game itself. It had beautiful characters and ideas. The community was just toxic AF. It reminded me a lot of the old Call of Duty days on the X box 360. It took a minute to find a lobby that wasn’t toxic but once you did you were with these guys the whole time. I can remember joking around and having fun back then. It could get toxic but some of us would shut that shit down quick. League was a new level of crazy.

hm9v1vs,Random_Stealth_Ward,11/27/2021,1,36.0,Not really just 50 range is worth a lot for a ton of ADCs. One of the common complains about champions like kalista or Wivir for example are their pathetic ranges 50 on them is huge nevermind 100. the problem is that in early game ranged Champions take too long to get to it and then use the extra range in part due to lower agency for many of them thanks to supports and junglers while melees usually are against melees and the most they worry about is the jungler so with the high AS scaling and more agency/control it becomes a very strong choice.  Range gets less AS obviously because they will get more AS than melees in general but it feels like atm melee AS is too high while ranged AS is too low

Shen won lane and everything we got top turrrt first with herald and as soon as kayn got his goredrinker hes so hard to kill. Even when we bought anti-heal hes still healing massive.   We won the game but damn that kayn was so close to solo carry his team. Well not really so carrying but he drag out fights that couldve end faster so we could close the game.
hmantgc,tanezuki,11/27/2021,1,85.0,Well Thornmail specfically answers this ? Armor and antiheal.   Also building Thornmail doesnt mean I wouldnt build Randuin in a classic comp (where theres usually only one AP with maybe an AP support who doesnt deal damage).

hmaajka,CanIBeFIREIn10Years,11/27/2021,1,5.0,Idk man. This is just part of what you have to deal with when playing LoL. IMO it is normal to be angry in this kind of situation. However if it keeps repeating over and over its not good for you at all.   Regardless of why you play LoL raging at them would be harmless to them and harmful for you so my suggestion is to either find a duo/team or just forget about them and move on.
hmbqz0v,3IC3,11/27/2021,1,70.0,In theory you’re right but the problem is I’m dogshit at Pyke so now with this item I get punished less for missing the execute threshold or the whole R.

As DL said the team should feel Upset leaving them was justified and they clearly dont.

hmcgvvw,Potential_Hornet_559,11/27/2021,1,420.0,Lol I love how you use ‘infact’ when it was just what Upset said.  Who knows what really went down.  We all have seen how players all talked to each other to form teams.  Again I am not saying this is what happened here.  But I also wouldn’t just take Upset’s word as ‘facts’ either.

hmc87d2,leathrow,11/27/2021,1,91.0,yeah. biggest abuse of it i saw was on shen. like sure he wants to build tank asap. but our shen stomped the game because he was constantly ulting around all the time. ulting -> e into the enemy team and then split push constantly with ult up  i also weirdly enjoyed rushing it on senna support. having your ult up for shield all the time is great and its easy to get damage off on the whole enemy team as senna. rushing it basically just turns you into an ad lux
hm9zfvl,SaulJoker,11/27/2021,1,70.0,I wonder if you’ve actually used a build that uses Death’s Dance and Chempunk but I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt and say that you have and still believe what you believe.

hmbvj1x,Tsuhume,11/27/2021,1,221.0,Lucian is definitely a main character. Since frankly Senna Thresh and Viego exist relative to him. Gwen Vayne and Vlad (is he even in this group?!?) would probably be relevant side characters too. Its a little weird b/c Vayne and Lucian are actually very similar thematically. But riot opted to build around Lucian.

hmb6srh,tyrelltsura,11/27/2021,1,33.0,its kinda crazy just how much admin abuse goes on in this server and tyrell doesnt even bother hiding it at this point. When I think about Randojoe I get the uncontrollable urge to simp for him. I know I was going to win Joes heart and if that had happened Joe wouldve been happy forever and Tyrell knew that and had to find a way to stop that from happening so the admin team could keep him for themselves. And if you think Randojoe deserves anything but the best then youre sadly too far gone to be saved   Also btw allowing srtty to have kennen is 100% griefing.

If you do they can trade dragon for a turret (individual dragons are very weak).  That’s my point there’s always a way they can trade objectives and there’s nothing you can do about it. You can’t defend everything at once

hma13bq,Bananaeater45,11/27/2021,1,14.0,If you are Nuguri why bother? You came to TES to make bank and you did. If you think that your teammates are trash then its betetr for your mental to just play to 90% of your level without sacrificing more of your mental and physical strength to maybe pull off an upset win.  I think he tryharded in Spring but after realising that his midlaner builds Zhonias on Malz he just decided that its better to preserve mental and just go next year
hmbak89,Sooap,11/27/2021,1,40.0,You think? After killing so many people hed base and spend the gold.

hmbxkd0,hochan17,11/27/2021,1,196.0,I know its popular to hate on new stuff and reworks but i personally much prefer new Swain both to play and to play against. Old swain was just 2 point and click DoTs that mercilessly bullied any melee laners that tried to CS and after 6 he was almost impossible to push out of lane. New swain feels much more satisfying to play especially with how his ult actually makes you feel like big dick on campus instead of just a i want 200 hp back toggle. Ofc it sucks that riot gutted his solo lane capabilities and seems to be hellbent on making him a botlaner but I do still enjoy playing this version of Swain more than the old.

You shouldn’t lose at every point of the game to those champs on every champion. It could even be changing your starting item. There’s lots of ways to combat those champs. Now I’m one of the biggest one’s is CC and focusing your cc towards those champs. Akali Camille Zed and LB don’t do much when cc locked or being threatened by being CC locked.

hmcfg9l,SadBlackMage,11/27/2021,1,395.0,Indeed they definitely prefer making skins for characters they can get creative with. Its not just about sales its just that much easier to fit lux ezreal or mf into new skin line concepts than zac mundo or ornn.   iirc a skin designer commented somewhere they actually had to drop some skin design concepts for ahri because they made too many of them.

hmcy6cv,Frozen_Watcher,11/27/2021,1,94.0,> For example when westerners think anime characters are supposed to represent white Europeans instead of Japanese. You have to realize that East Asians have their own ideal of beauty standards and are not necessarily striving to look white. This whole obsession with certain phenotypes representing a certain race creeps into race realism anyways so Imma nope out now.  Yeah being on reddit this shit annoys me a lot when it comes from oblivious Europeans and Americans who bitch about their representation in Asian fantasy lol. These characters are stylized pretty Asians they are not supposed to be Europeans.
hmb90sp,PixiCode,11/27/2021,1,52.0,world runes were WMDs which caused massive sweeping cultural shifts on the entirety of the planet due to the mass devastation caused by them. Humans migrated as refugees to the continent Ionia is on creating the half-breed Vastayans we have now like Xayah + the nation of Ionia. Demacia was formed out of fear of mages that spawned due to the use and abuse of world runes. Entire regions were reshaped and forever changed due to this magic.  Runic magic =/= world runes though. Ryze uses ordinary runic magic and doesnt use the world runes just hides/safeguards them.

hmabbc0,howtopayherefor,11/27/2021,1,24.0,Theres a major difference between the game is not balanced to account for that and the game would be unbalanced if that were the case right? Your point used to be that mana conversion would be game breaking or invalidate the item system but I havent seen any good example or reason for that happening.  Maybe theres a specific combination of items that would make a manaless champion too strong but that we could only figure out after playtesting sure. I doubt the AH from Liandrys would skyrocket Vlad into S tier. But any such oversight (if any) can obviously be fixed and wed still have the benefit of widening item builds for manaless champions and introduce new legendary items with mana to make mana scaling on tear items make any sense.

hmbkgcx,donglover2020,11/27/2021,1,88.0,I disagree actually. Sylas could be argued as the main character for Demacia but i feel like Lux fills that role A LOT better. Shes perfectly divided between both sides of the conflict and her actions would resolve the plotline. But regardless neither of them have a global influence theyre confined to Demacia (and Sylas had a small trip to Freljord but didnt do anything major before coming back)

hmcgskg,CosmoJones07,11/27/2021,1,395.0,Theres definitely some overlap in there though Lux and Ezreal are definitely skin sellers.  Karma would be another good example of a not massively popular champ that gets a lot of skins too like Ziggs.  Tristana as well though I think shes a lot more popular than those 2.
hm9edz6,BigNateMan,11/27/2021,1,583.0,I started playing almost exactly a month ago. I just got to summoner lvl 30 and have access to ranked should i wait till season 12 starts to do my placements?   I have a goal of making it to Gold in my 1st season and am willing to put in the time to achieve that. Can anybody give me some general tips of what to focus on champs worth putting time into to eventually make Plat (i really like brand malzahar diana and gwen)  and tips for learning the basics quickly? I already spend a lot of time watching guys like Neace on youtube.

hmcdedg,piotrj3,11/27/2021,1,,> mage bot winrates fall off a cliff after the 20 minute mark  Wrong. Most mages have 2 high winrates at 20-25 mark and 40+. Simply they are kings of mid game and hyper late game but there are transition phases when ADCs are stronger. The only exception is ziggs but ziggs is not hyper scaler he is designed to push objectives so if you dont manage to push and win early he loses. Syndra 40+ has 58% winrate on botlane Karthus has highest winrate 40+ and 2nd highest 20-25 but has the worst winrate in early game. Swain has highest winrate at 35-40. Cassiopeia has fairly stable winrate until going to the sky at 40 mins.   Generally all champions i mentioned have bad winrate pre 20 mins good 20-25 after faces a bit of drop to go to the sky with winrate at 35-40 or 40+. And i observe situation for quite a while and it is consistent thing that outside of Ziggs winrate of non-adcs on botlane is good both early and late with a bit of drop around 30 mins (probably time ADC has powerspike with IE) but in hyper late they arent greater because at hyper late mage get powerspike of core items + rabadon + void staff that together are even bigger.   MOST mids are extremly opressive. Aurelion is opressive just to open idea to roam. Talon is opressive. Just thing is opressivity of adc on mid ends on first few levels and just ends there because adcs possibility to roam decreases and ADCs generally lose 2vs2 situations when junglers become online. Meanwhile such talon pushes lane roams kills junglers etc. This is why despite being unpleasant to be played against they never dominated winrates or pickrates (except pro with Lucian). Corki isnt opressive 1-3 he is more like a mage because he scales with levels but not that much with items. He is spellcaster not really adc he is more closer to a mage.  If ADC dmg was reliable they would dominate total dmg charts on lolalytics. 3 highest tier ADCs on lolalitcs:  - vayne 19k dmg 30/41 in place  - Jhin 18.8k dmg 35/41  - Draven  22k dmg 14/41  Meanwhile mages:  - Karthus 32k dmg 1/41  - viktor 234k 5/41  - Cassiopeia 205k 21/41  - Heimer 23k 7/41  - Ziggs 24k 4/41   - Swain 217 13/41.  You might say it is because mages poke and it inflates their dmg. yes but adcs who are based around poke and maybe supporting their teams (Like Varus/Ashe) are heavy behind mentioned ADCs. The highest dmg done by ADC is Kogmaw (who is 2nd) but he has overwhelming duo rate with Lulus and at such point you compare 2 champions vs 1 and Twitch (who is 8th). Both of those ADCs unlike mages also dont provide any utility outside of slow meanwhile a lot of champions mentioned above has abilities that on their own without assist can change teamfights.  Reliability of ADC is limited by how much his team protects him against how many enemy champions want to kill him and it soloq it is quite easy. Mage who is focused at least has zhonya and even if mage gets behind utility of mages in terms of stuns/snares/slows is often way above. Mages on average are quite good botlane they arent quite popular because most people are parroting meta from pro play where team comps actually can protect well around ADCs and make them good. In soloq ADCs are good if you play them in duo proper team comps like Kog-lulu lucian nami heavy oriented Draven snowball comp etc. But if that wasnt a case I would pick mage on botlane anytime.  PS: I am botlane swain main.

hma1h4i,StarEaterShaddai,11/27/2021,1,431.0,My own experience playing between low silver and low diamond on both servers is that on EUNE there are a lot more clueless people in lower ranks meaning that they cant CS properly jungle randomly have little to no macro sense which only gets better around platinum while EUW low ranked people would usually show some practice like having a stable CS doing proper rotations around the map securing objectives but falling apart as soon as they cant follow a guide. What this implies to me is just that EUNE low ranks just have more organically bad players while EUWs low ranks have a lot of smurfs hardstucks and people carried by champs that fall apart as soon as they encounter a single opponent that knows how to counter them. Around plat they start feeling the same.     On the other note I think the honor system needs to be reworked into a proper behaviour matchmaking system rather than there being no shades between toxic players roaming free and being chat/temp banned. By toxic I include those that cant communicate. They should be separated from proper serious players either way no matter how mechanically skilled they are.

hmbmiox,ArchdevilTeemo,11/27/2021,1,,**Do you have rankings for clearly number 1 in terms of playerbase?** I have the suspicion that quite a few mobile games are very popular because they are also very accessible.  And yes they have the biggest esport scene only csgo comes close. This is based on the big playerbase + that it is enjoyable to watch. SC2 for example is also great to watch but they dont patch enough (which means there will be a lot of similar games) & have a small playerbase so the esport scene is quite small.  And there is one of the biggest reasons LoL is so big compared to other games they patch so much that the game always feels fresh and while they often soft break the game these phases dont last that long. Most other games only patch once every few month.  It is possible to perfectly balance lol and give every champion a role in that they shine but this would require to stop adding new content and those radical patches. The problem is LoL would no longer get new patches at some point because otherwise it would unbalance the game.  To me LoL is the perfect side or backup game because you can always play it when you dont have a better game to play.

hmc8bt7,Gr0ode,11/27/2021,1,612.0,And people never read comments but instead just upvote pictures on their feed reddit has changed…
hmacp37,SP3EDI,11/27/2021,1,311.0,that gives them the right to be angry about upset leaving. it does not give the right to adam to make up false claims and rumors to direct the toxic french fanbase over on all social media to harass upset and his wife.

hm9glgs,oVnPage,11/27/2021,1,34.0,Yes the storyline in a 40 hour fully voiced RPG is better than the story in 50 lines of text essentially displayed in a web browser. Whod have thought?  Riot has hopefully learned their lesson: Dont do big stories like SOL in the League client. Give them the space they deserve.
hm9y3oy,vegeful,11/27/2021,1,,And people will complain that riot does not give double warning. Then we will have another thread about if u misclick the undo button should be there without limit if u plan to undo the next hour.   Then we will have player who try to find loophole on it.   People are stupid and people will do stupid action to see if it work.
hmc6aez,seanbentley441,11/27/2021,1,406.0,Yea Im having so much fun as singed now that melees I used to be able to kite can just run me down at level 1 with 90% attack speed its very fun. Tryndamere yi and irelia definitely arent a little op with 3 items worth of attack speed level one. Singed definitely needed to have his kit drastically modified and then nerfed again as a result but this is alright.  🤡
hmbe2d8,KogMawOfMortimidas,11/27/2021,1,,Shieldbow was the least picked mythic of the trio at worlds? I counted it up in [a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/qdn9nb/camille_seriously_needs_to_be_addressed/hhpl256/) a while ago Galeforce had an overwhelming majority while Kraken and Shieldbow were roughly equal.
hmcbwhf,Rathama,11/27/2021,1,4.0,I dont really like people dodging ARAM or asking others do dodge for them because they didnt get a champ they play. Like it is ARAM what do you expect?   Sometimes if all the champion options I can get make me extremely uncomfortable I *consider* it but I would only dodge if I have an extra special reason to.  But I am speaking from the point of view as someone who plays ARAM as my main mode when I am not taking a break from League or recovering from a break (in which I would go co op vs ai).   If playing melee makes you that unhappy and you dont play ARAM normally I would consider that and extra special reason.
hmd6514,Brushner,11/27/2021,1,98.0,Nope its an absolute shithole where the strong can do whatever they want. Cross a mage? enjoy having a limb transmutated like in the Thresh cinematic. Are you a young mage? Enjoy getting kidnapped and sent out into a battle royale camp where the losers get their magic removed and placed into the winner like Rell. People wake up to their relatives dying to plague all the time to the point Karthus got obsessed with death. Also gladiator slave pits for PoWs like Xinhao and dissedents like Alistar. Lastly if you want to invade Asia remember the to bring your child soldiers and hope they dont defect like Kayn. The lesson for Noxus is that brutal militaristic societies end up make their own worst enemies.
hm962nx,Amsement,11/27/2021,1,199.0,Again I dont recall any instance of LS saying he thinks Jensen is a bad player. I watched his costreams and he generally criticized Jensens laning but never called him a bad player. The reoccurring opinion LS has had on Jensens laning in both Facechecks and his individual streams is that Jensens laning looks like hes just clocking in for a job. He literally said he thinks Jensen has better teamfighting and camera control than most other mids in LCS so he clearly doesnt think that Jensen is just completely bad. If you find an instance of LS saying Jensen is a bad player then share it. So far all youve guys have done is downvote and claim that x and y has been said without providing any real examples of when these things were supposedly said. I havent heard LS say anything about Jensen his peers havent also said aside from perhaps his worlds performance.   > Also same caliber/potential implies that he doesnt think he is a top player in the region at all. Id like to see what players hes talking about and check in and see if they have comparable accomplishments as jensen.  No it doesnt. Gori and Fate are two players LS mentioned that would at the very least give you the same performance as Jensen did this year if not better. They also wouldnt cost as much as he does. This argument about accomplishments is such a shallow one considering that were options that compete in a far stronger league than Jensen does.

Because if this man left his team 12 hours before the biggest tourny of their lives they have worked towards all year to go home and play 6 arams a day with his GF then nahhhhhhhh fuck that.
hmaijyx,Sonder332,11/27/2021,1,81.0,Does it matter if he won 5 years ago or last year? Hes still a world champion to diminish it with how recent it was is kind of ridiculous.   corejj cant win lcs with stacked af rosters for 2 years in a row It is a 5v5 team game right? That means it doesnt all fall on one person right? Im just asking because the way you phrase your response you seem to think its a 1v1 solo game and one person can carry.

hmbzvs9,TheUItimateBlip,11/27/2021,1,262.0,I mean it depends on what you value in game design. I doubt that more than a small percentage cares in any way about how the map looks in winter. On the flip side Riot also came to the conclusion that more different maps as the winter rift limits them in design because of clarity. this is like swapping between blue and greenscreen with the same set. then you cant use green or blue on yourself without having worse quality. This isnt a massive issue in lol but it clearly exists. Now they decided that overall clarity and more design-freedom is more relevant for them than having different maps.    People might argue with aram but this mode is much less competitive.   &#x200B  Of course its also not monetized by them anyways but there are small benefits and small issues and I personally disagree with this post and much rather have it normal. If you wanna see snow just go outside. :P
hmb28ld,anoel24,11/27/2021,1,616.0,Which role do you want to play? These types of champions are commonly used in Top Support or Jungle. Examples: In top Malphite or Shen support Leona or Amumu in jungle Nunu or Warwick.

hma3fc5,SaulJoker,11/27/2021,1,,The thing is you’re only looking at the numbers for the stat and not the passive or active effects of items the abilities of the champions and how they interact with the items or even something as simple as Liandry’s mythic passive giving ability haste.  Please stop tunneling on the stat itself and look at the applications of the items you’re proposing these champions build.  EDIT: Just to make my point even clearer.  Vlad being able to build the old liandry was fine because the game was balanced to account for that.  Vlad being able to build the new liandry is not fine because the game is not balanced to account for that.

Everyone takes a risk including the team not just the player and the upsides are better than your garbage. You think rekkles isnt getting bank because hes playing in France who have some of the most spending fans of all of EU? They foot the bill not even compatible to the other two which are still on their payroll regardless and have confidence in their skills. They will keep doing it and you will keep wondering why people do it while crying as if there was no benefits to it. I told you some of the benefits to it risks are things every party takes and doesnt denounce the benefits they see in this and why it keeps happening. The biggest risk is getting paid to do nothing I dont think they care about your argument.

hm9etao,Dastu24,11/27/2021,1,13.0,I also noticed that ingame performance is easily overuled by all players mmr? I could carry the game 14/3/9 and earn 14lp while the rest were 3/3 but other game i would make mistakes die barely managed to lane and contribute with cc ending 3/9/5 doing nothing but csing but still being 50 creeps behind getting carried and getting 18lp (these two games where in succession)
hmagr4h,WintersEnvoy,11/27/2021,1,6.0,I could explain winrate:      Wins over losses   Probable on your case: recent winrate last 400 games: 50 %   winrate total 52 % in 800 games probably because a significant chunk was played in lower than your current elo.     A wild guess youve probably climbed a 100 or 200+ lp the last few dozen games climbed a lot but not really proved to the ingame system you deserve your current rank. Hence it wants you to win more than you lose to prove you deserve to be here and win even more if you want to climb even higher than the system thinks you deserve. Why? Because your winrates probably not very good the last 400 games and most of thsoe games were probably played in lower rank than what you are currently in because you probably climbed a lot recently.        MMR is very torqued. If you win the next 28/50 games youre gonna be the same rank youre now but the system is gonna give you as much as you are losing in LP per win/loss (probably) or if you derank a bit the system might give you more than you lose per win because you managed to raise the mmr higher than what you derank to.
hmantkc,Trenton2001,11/27/2021,1,144.0,I know this is a late response but MF and Ahri have such a direct relation to the story that them being PC choices makes 0 sense. MF rules bilgewater part of that means protecting her and her people from the giant shadow isle danger RIGHT next to. Ahri and Yasuo headed to bilgewater together (which was teased in the cinematic where yone and yasuo fight) Yasuo to escape his past Ahri to find her past. Ahris ancestors had visited the blessed isles before they became the shadow isles. Illoais goddess hates the shadow isles.  Her god is all about destiny and change the shadow isles never change and its like a place in the world thats paused. Pyke and Braum are the only two oddities that feel like their story for being part of it was kind of random but both are still well written and great choices.  Btw this is ALL spoiler free everything I listed here is information available before the game came out (except for pyke and braums reasons which is why I didnt mention what they were) and even before the ruination event.
hmbdk3x,Chokkitu,11/27/2021,1,,No thats old lore. In the current lore Swain overthrew Boram Darkwill and killed him by himself and is trying to remove The Black Roses (and by extension LeBlancs) influence from Noxus. Though she is somewhat responsible for Swains rise to power since she was the one that made Boram invade Ionia which was part of the reason why Swain rose to power.

hm92xx2,Musashis_Balls,11/27/2021,1,,Hmm I don’t know if I agree with you on the team fight thing  when the kill count in dota is much higher. I’ve always felt like too much was riding in team fights in league because when I watch worlds it seems like they do everything they can too avoid it. It feels like they are always on edge because they know that one bad fight can lose them the game whereas dota encourages you to fight by giving you cushions like farming jungle or buy back or whatever.

No one else wanted him because he is expansive and every one knows he that he is upper middle of the pack Mid that costs much money because he came back from the inflated NA salary.  He wanted to leave and Fnatic got Humanoid to replace him what even is a big upgrade. Nisqy can only blame himself that no one wants him to play.   Adam was to be replaced anyway from fnatic. He himself wanted to go anyway so he got sold. Same as Nisqy no one forced him to play really bad at worlds.

Yeah its surely caps backstabbing fnc everything else that happened in the last 3 years is a coincidence.

hma1e4q,tanezuki,11/27/2021,1,70.0,Those scale well with crits but every other champions in the subclass are able to use the stats and passives aswell it wouldnt be locked to them because they dont have crit based passives.
hmd5mmr,JoshQuest1,11/27/2021,1,37.0,Thats the old qqr and I suppose thats the main point they changed is that it used to be easier to walk a bit/flash/protobelt with it.    I can never do it anymore in a way thats useful in a live environment.   that .39 seconds of wiggle room (.36 including ping from lag) is jut a little too little.    I imagine it is easier in a 0/sub-10 ping environment.
hmbkgua,XDME,11/27/2021,1,154.0,Statistically your just wrong. Hextech is the second strongest by a decent margin.  Now chemtech is far better then it and everything else. But hextech is arguably too strong as well.
hmbvpwj,Carsonsbro,11/27/2021,1,196.0,Its annoying to fight if the enemy team has it and Its really unpredictable if you have it. I was playing Vi one game and it just didnt work when I died no clue why.
hmahg6c,Abductedllama,11/27/2021,1,441.0,This should be the top comment in this thread. The amount of complaining about lip syncing boob size and Imagine Dragons is absolutely absurd.  On a lighter note that’s one of the dopest cosplays I have ever seen.

If you play with friends anyways there is no need to type with randoms. If you want to communicate with them use pings. If s1 spam pings mute him/her as well. It helps you improve faster too. I was stuck in low plat cuz I argued got distracted or tilt cuz of randoms. Since I mute all I am able to focus more on the game and was able to reach high dia cuz of that ^^

hmb23v2,ElBigDicko,11/27/2021,1,91.0,Chemtech soul has highest winrate its completly overpowered because there is nearly no way to comeback vs it. You will auto win any 5v5. Also Infernal sucks Hextech when it procs on 4 deals more damage and slows.
hmc8pzf,brokerZIP,11/27/2021,1,406.0,Yone and yas emergency buffs were because of 2items wasnt 100% crit anymore and having 2item spike was their mandatory and they were balanced around that.   Varus switched to lethality due to Riot wanting him to. They buffed his Q several times turned out its broken then they nerfed rest of his kit but not q. So hes basically forced to be lethality marksmen. Idk about Sivir but she was broken with early pre nerf duskblade. And people still build lethality by inertia LULW  Ziggs being strong in botlane because you cant ever contest a shieldbow adc in all in so poking the shit out of enemy to pop shield is the play. Not to mention ziggs was played bot in S10 . And because S11 was all about AD midlane so you have to have some Magic damage in team.  As for GP. He was bad himself not because of bad items. Xayah was the same period.

hmd1p98,Crivelo,11/27/2021,1,78.0,You okay lol?   Crashing wave on 3 doesn’t for sure mean you have good wave control but crashing on 2 indicates that you do have bad wave control.   There’s almost no scenario in which it’s good to crash wave on 2. You’re not level 3 and you don’t have enough gold to back and buy anything worthwhile. It can also give free push prio to enemy laner for crab.   I never said I would do any better. Whether or not I would do better is irrelevant. Crashing the wave on 3 in both these games had nothing to do with cheater recalling

And kill anyone they encounter morde once governed like half the continent or so i think leblanc is technically anyone and controls everything in the dark according to lore so its like in pokemons pokedex entries : for some reason some pokemons are literally twice as hot as the sun but dont burn anything or can take a mountain with just one of their 4 arms but life goes on without any big problem

hmauw39,HrvatskaMilan,11/27/2021,1,147.0,Thank you for commenting!  Other people have pointed out azir’s ultimate bug. It is the most easily reproducable bug in the game i can think of you press it as you die. When you do this the wall will go out it will go on cooldown but it will pass through enemies do no damage not knock them back and it is not an obstacle.

hmbrhz0,KogMawOfMortimidas,11/27/2021,1,326.0,Why would we want every champion to have a 50% winrate across the board? Should winrate factor in elo or should we aim for 50% winrate for every champion at every elo? If we try for 50% at every elo then pubstomp champions like Master Yi or Trynd who historically stomp low elo but suffer in high elo are in need of buffs AND nerfs at the same time and inversely high elo co-ordination requirement or high skill requirement champs like Azir Ryze Kalista etc. who have bad winrates in low elo and good at high elo are again also in need of buffs and nerfs at the same time. So maybe winrate shouldnt be blanket 50% across the board and some champions should have different winrates at different elos.   But then what about champion mastery curves and games played? Shouldnt a player with 500 games have a better winrate than a player picking the champ up for the first time? If both the experienced player and the new player achieve the same winrate (assuming in the same elo) then why bother mastering a champion? Why put hours into learning a champion when the improvements you make dont translate to more victories? Play easy champs play hard champs play a lot on one champ or games across multiple champs it doesnt matter because you are always at 50% winrate. So perhaps experienced players should be able to achieve high winrates on champs they master but then this leads to the classic Aurelion Sol problem where he historically has a high winrate and this is somehow problematic. Some champions will have a few dedicated masters which props the winrate up while other champions notably the flashy ones like Riven Zed YASUO etc. will be picked up by new players who dumpster the winrate because they dont know what they are doing. Perhaps a champion is actually overpowered but doesnt show it in the winrate stats because there are too many newer players who cant make it work.  Some champions are also not blind-pickable so they rarely ever get picked into bad matchups or only get picked with their absolute preference of team comp like KogMaw who almost always wants a Lulu support and hates to be picked into hook supports. Since Kog doesnt actually get to see his bad matchups he only ever gets good matchups and thus wins them more often as expected. Does this mean Kog is overpowered since he wins more? To me this sounds like Kog would actually be underpowered since he cant face bad matchups or go without his Lulu. Or maybe its neither and champions can simply be niche and have a winrate that reflects them. What about team composition? Shouldnt a well drafted team win more and so a champion that fits into more drafts or be a flex pick win more often? Perhaps a champion that fits only one extremely specific team composition perfectly will have a massively inflated winrate which fluctuates with the popularity and viability of that composition. This doesnt even begin on the differences between solo queue and pro play. Which one do we balance for? This topic alone is another essay for another day.  Another question is does winrate even equal probability to win a game if you pick this champion? Its pretty easy to see that it doesnt countering yourself in a matchup doesnt sound like you should expect to win the game even if your champ has a 52% winrate. So maybe we need to filter the winrate from all games to winrate in games where you counter pick yourself. But then maybe your champ works really well in your team comp anyways so we need to filter the sample games down even further and so on and on until you realize you are playing a truly unique game. No one has ever played the game you are about to play with the same champions players runes items movements around the map random number rolls like crits and dragons etc. etc. The sample size of games to use to determine your winrate for the upcoming match is 0 there are no games that meet the conditions required to accurately reflect the statement champion winrate equals chance to win.  Next does buffing a champion increase its winrate? Does nerfing a champion decrease its winrate? Intuitively one would believe that a buff leads to an increase while a nerf leads to a decrease but this isnt necessarily true. Sometimes buffing a champion actually decreases the winrate which is usually explained by an influx of newer players who are excited to try the buffs but cant actually play the champion. Similarly a nerf makes these Flavour of the Month players leave and go find the next buffed OP champion leaving only the actual dedicated mains who bring the winrate back up. Sometimes the champion doesnt get touched at all and the winrate changes due to a counter matchup being nerfed or an item or build path getting buffed. League is an extremely connected game you cannot touch one champion or one item and expect everything else to stand still. Xayah saw a skyrocket in winrate due to a build change and it just took the playerbase recognizing the strength of the new build to play her. Sometimes Riot does nothing at all and winrate changes like the time they said they nerfed Vladimir in the patch notes but the nerf never actually went through. Placebo effect made people perceive Vlad as being weaker despite nothing actually changing and this affected his winrate.   ___  After all this winrate to me is a rather worthless statistic easy to manipulate and almost impossible to filter to show any meaningful information. Not because we dont know how to properly filter and control for factors but simply that the idea of balance controls winrate and therefore winrate indicates good balance is just false. Across every Moba Ive played every game genre where there is a competitive scene we have to ask what we want from the game. Should one good player who is far and above anyone else at a specific champion win more often than not? Is this a sign of imbalance or a sign of a good player perhaps the best player? Or should choices such as champions in League or fighters in Smash be meaningless cosmetic choices that leave you with the same template as everyone else? Should easy and hard champions be equally as easy to win games with so that skill expression has been decoupled from victory? In any of these situations what does winrate mean and does it reflect on a game developers or communities goal on what they want from their game? To me winrate has never reflected meaningfully on ANYTHING in a team based hugely interconnected frequently balanced game like League of Legends which is why I never want to see game balanced be justified from winrate ALONE. Game balance is too complicated for any collection of simple statistics it unfortunately takes a level of feel and intuition from experienced players high elo and professional along with considerations for every other elo and player type (like ARAM players) and overall balance direction and game design to come to any decisions on who to buff and who to nerf.

hmch5bk,DHSUAUGEV,11/27/2021,1,435.0,That isnt true at all. Yasuo has actually always been above yone in statistics pre lethal tempo. You can go back and look yourself.   If they go against each other it also shows it as a skill match.  If you didnt know yasuos q has more damage than yones. Yasuo gains bonus damage after he ults and yasuos ult had a better scaling. Yasuos shield can also absorb more damage.   Late game is is potentially easier to kill a yone over a yas since yone can do all in but in solo que yones ult has more agency.   Yasuos gathering storm is also ranged.   Yasuo also has his wind wall. The only other thing like it in the game is braum shield or Samira w.   Yasuo e compared to yone e is also comparable. Yone e is really good for dueling and making picks but if you use it wrong it can kill you or you can eject yourself out of a fight too soon. While yasuo e is also good for dueling but its also good for laning. I know everyone has experienced a yasuo dashing around a minion wave and he ends up turning the fight around on you.

hmbbtcf,masterluke05,11/27/2021,1,40.0,There are very few items that provide more offensive stats than Axiom Arc since pretty much all lethality items have vaguely the same statline and Pyke ult generates like an extra 600 gold on killing someone (you get the kill gold AND you AND the person who assisted both get gold sacks.) So it is very hard to argue that Axiom isnt the best item for Pyke to have here with scaling in mind. It is also worth noting that it provides the most raw Ability Haste of any Lethality item so that does translate into some extra mobility and damage from being able to cast more abilities than other items.

hmaalm5,Oopsifartedsorry,11/27/2021,1,313.0,100% agree and I side with Adam here. What Upset did is indefensible and I wouldn’t want him on my team. If it wasn’t private enough to tell your coach it’s not private enough to keep your teammates out of the loop. The coach isn’t the only person on the team. From Adam’s view this guy just dipped cuz he felt like it even though that’s not the case but it’s essentially the same if you don’t give an explanation as to why and make vague statements.

hmc6wc5,Excalidorito,11/27/2021,1,406.0,The lifesteal is hardly the issue with Conqeuror.  The issue is that it’s a rune that’s based on how quickly you can stack it meaning assassins could blow their entire combo and it’d just progressively deal more damage (even if it wasn’t by a huge amount).  You’re definitely onto something with the slow stacking though that would make it better suited for bruisers who want to stay in the fight for a long time without making it easily abusable by assassins (most likely unless we see bruiser-assassins again).

hmaa10d,WE-Draz,11/27/2021,1,83.0,I never said 50 range was nothing though?  50 range almost double melee champs Whereas 100 while awesome is nothing comparable.  Arent we arguing for the same thing ? Im saying the rune is busted for melee while only usable for ranged champions.  Also adcs range matter a lot in lane yes but the rune only trigger after 6 autoattacks. There is absolutely no movement/pressure game around minions at this point since you are dead or they are dead.  The rune feels useless in lane outside of some wonky tank support matchup where you can stack it before fighting the enemy adc. 5% per auto is a joke.
hm96c84,musashihokusai,11/27/2021,1,40.0,Don’t fight em. Track him and be where he won’t be. Only take major objectives as a team.   He has no answers to good poke or kiting.   It’s just asymmetrical gameplay. You wouldn’t try and match a full build Fiora splitplush 1v1 right? Similar deal.

hm9k22g,Applepowdersnow,11/27/2021,1,6.0,Im sorry you are struggling i know this feeling too well!  &#x200B  i dont know if streaming will fix the issue here. (you dont need to be good to get some viewers i know silver/bronze players with avg 50 viewers).  playing with friends/viewers could help here aswell.     Sometimes it can help to just take a break for a few weeks and then get back to it again. <- this ive heard helps the most.     If neither streaming nor a break helps then it might be time to switch the game.
hmbgy2w,OneBar1905,11/27/2021,1,28.0,That last point is pretty naive. Evil people are people who do evil things regardless of intention. Hitler was trying to create a utopia for Germans. The problem is that utopia requires the extermination of Jewish people. Singed is just trying to advance science. The problem is that he is responsible for the deaths of countless innocent people.

hmc9xdu,Fishpuncommenter,11/27/2021,1,346.0,Asol seems like an important character instead of the main character. He created the cosmos and is the main force holding back the void but his overwhelming size and raw power don’t place him in the world of runeterra. He can hardly interact with most things in the world outside of destroying or creating it.   Ryze’s mission seems unimportant in the fight against the worst threat the world has seen yet the void. He’s preventing magical warfare that could destroy the world yes but the void can destroy reality the world and everything outside of it. He hasn’t really interacted with it.   Nunu however is a strong contender. He holds the inspiration world rune and doesn’t abuse it. Right now he’s using it on a quest to find his mom but his proximity to Lissandra (who’s holding back a void gateway) makes him a strong contender I think. He’s only a few champion meetings away from teaming with ryze teaming/defeating lissandra and stopping the void
hmc22qk,Ray_ADC,11/27/2021,1,2.0,Meh losing in 15 minutes because I didnt dodge the support main that got filled jungle and decides to flip the game doesnt make me better either.  If anything it makes me worse because that would ruin my mental for the rest of the day and now I cant play anymore.

Not like increased damage on missing health or flat magic/armor pen? Or a soul that makes it so your attacks apply a corrosive dot(with cooldown obviously) that does more damage the more missing health they have?   Nah its a full fucking revive so the guy i nearly died to gets a second chance to murder me as i run away or the teamfight we barely won immediately turns against us for a double ace.

We dont have such a sensational Drama media over hear like you guys have in murica. Dunno where you got that upset didnt want to play with adam before worlds. Upset was asked after worlds from alphari and fnatic management if he wants to play with alphari or adam. He chose alphari so would everyone else that has the choice. especially if you have the humanoid/perkz in mid too.  Iam on with you about that it is highly unlikely that fnatic would have won worlds. Nisqy and Adam showed that they are not up to par to win the competition. You would have maybe got more wins or got out of groups. But Bean showed up pretty good as sub and Adam and Nisqy still played horrible bad. They just want to scapegoat it to upset. Was it a mental shock to play with a sub ? sure. But there are other teams that have to play with subs from rival teams because of visa issues and they still give 100% to show up at worlds and dont just tilt and int it away to scapegoat others for bad performance later.

Or even just continue to stomp in nearly every game at least one person finishes with a bounty in them.  Objective bounties you **cannot** play around. You can’t defend all three lanes and both rivers at once. They’re going to be collected no matter what. Once midgame rolls in the entire point of the game is objectives. Unless you’re spawn camping them they have access to the map and can simply trade objectives and proc the bounty.

hm9iozs,General_Valerian,11/27/2021,1,252.0,I did watch that video too it was hilarious. I actually watched the whole game and that was an incredible stream and brought back a lot of memories of how the game was long ago.

He provides top tier entertainment whether its an LCS broadcast or a for fun tournament. What a freaking beast !   Just listening to him do the shoutouts for subs etc was top tier good times !

hm9bzy8,Opening_Exit_2094,11/27/2021,1,14.0,Im a master-ranked player.  The best call was to start a fight since they had voli out of position and they were grouping up anyway. the enemy ashe is seen bot lane while vex’s team is seen nearby.   If I were a fed vex with ult zonyas and heal  it’s only obvious that I should be looking for a pick knowing that I have the damage to burst at least 2-3 on the squishy enemy team while guaranteeing that I remain alive long enough throughout the fight. I have a kayn who could follow up the damage for killing blows. Gwen and yasuo could clean up. We played it off around our comp. I would be making a risky yet worth play. What else do you want? Let them engage and kayle would free hit? Of course not. This was a good play.

hmak6cr,CountCocofang,11/27/2021,1,63.0,Anyone has an idea how the AI works?  Because there is no way in hell it generated these images SOLELY from the name of the regions.  Does it have a vast library to fall back on with stock to pick from depending on the keyword? Does it do an internet search to look up related keywords? Does it just take an already existing image that pops up with that keyword and smears over it?
hmb4zu9,Glum_Radio,11/27/2021,1,147.0,So why are you replying me? My point from the beginning is about the FLUENTLY because they talk about Viper Viper = fluently. So they can’t compare Nuguri to Viper while they has different personality and ability. I’m talking about Viper and Nuguri im not talking about other.

hmcrx14,Excalidorito,11/27/2021,1,456.0,GP has always been able to sort of pick and choose what he wants to build though he was never exclusively a Crit champ.  He’s had natural synergy with Crit yes but he’s often just taken what’s better for him at the moment. If a certain Sheen effect is really strong (like Sunderer) he’d build that. If Crit was stronger he’d build that same with lethality.
hmbaz72,blacksocksonly,11/27/2021,1,125.0,played a game where enemy had Chemtech Soul + Fed Akshan and it felt like a tower defense constantly killing zombies and they revive and come back with GA then come back as zombies again. It was fun but it was impossible to win. I mostly think its about the time in-between revival that can be adjusted. its almost like a free zhonya everytime they die.
hmctenh,Mahelas,11/27/2021,1,490.0,Eh id say Iron-Man and Batman dont fulfill the same niche and Batman is still probably the single most popular hero with Spidey as a runner-up and Superman as the old icon !
hmcsoru,Rechulas,11/27/2021,1,5.0,I... think Camilles stuff is sort of an offshoot of Hextech. Not entirely used for the Magic through science bits but the fact that the Crystals are a crazy powerful energy source and uses it to keep her false organs functioning and her weapons active where Viktor is about bypassing the need for organs in the first place.  I... I think. lmao

hmbltpv,Neonvaporeon,11/27/2021,1,,Thing is most ads scale very well with xp (ez Lucian jinx) and later levels are worth more stats than early ones. Supports on the other hand dont care about levels besides certain breakpoints (2 or 3 depending on the champ 6 and 13 for the item.) Those combined means in 90% of cases you should not leach xp when the ads are JUST farming (if your ad is getting dove or zoned you need to help etc.)

hm9ym7l,Spicy_Pineapple_,11/27/2021,1,20.0,I think they’re asking specifically who’s best at taking turret shots while quickly wrecking it but Ziggs really is awesome at taking turrets with a wave. It’s literally in his kit to do just that like you mentioned. I agree with you.
hmd1cgb,Exmerus,11/27/2021,1,128.0,He is better than Josedeodo but Jose is much more cheaper for sure. Plus he brings Latin American fans to follow FLY. Sven would be an upgrade but not as impactful to justify the massive $$$ diff.
hmanpwv,Exclarius,11/27/2021,1,,> Which makes YOUR defence of why Upset didnt talk to Adam and everyone else invalid. Glad you understand.  How? How does it make it invalid? Once again Upset decides who he communicates details to. He communicated. He did not communicate details to people like Adam. Thats all there is to it. It is literally that simple. If you (or Adam) feel like you need to know someones life story thats fine. It doesnt mean that they have to tell it to you (or Adam).  > Nobody did that here so another strawman.   If you check the quote replies on Upsets tweet which language are the harassing tweets (mostly) written in? Which nationality does Adam have? Ill give you a hint: Its the same. That is not a coincidence :)

hmatwn7,SamsungBaker,11/27/2021,1,65.0,From my experience its useless soul tbh   Ocean or infernal are far more impactful   Infernal literally make support so strong that they can do massiva dmg to ADC or mid in tf

hmcor0p,rronkong,11/27/2021,1,455.0,Soraka is a celestial being that went into a human form like Bard but shes more focused on healing and helping others.   I just read up about Syndra shes an insanely strong magician and judging from the lore Id say only Aurelion Sol or ryze could stand against her
hma30fj,BigMoistWetty,11/27/2021,1,126.0,lets solve the problem for good and remove her stealth   not like she isnt able to 100-0 tanks and brawlers unstealthed anyway
hm8we4a,infinityoncorktree,11/27/2021,1,12.0,FWIW Blaber said he had to tag in 2 or 3 of his players at the last minutes because Copy and some other ditched. Said he picked up Zeyzal either last night or this morning.  Also Zeyzal is technically an amateur right now. Each team is supposed to be 3 LCS 1 Academy and 1 amateur
hm9v4y8,NorthLeech,11/27/2021,1,45.0,I was so happy to see Ahri story that actually gave som answers and moved her character forward!
hmavrty,Jailwhale,11/27/2021,1,170.0,To be fair Melee bruisers really needed the AS AS options for bruisers and melee fighters are really bad. espicially since they removed the 50% AS mythic passive from trinity..........  and there are a LOT of bruisers that primarily DPS through auto with abilities for bursting.  Riot is on record stating they hate the ADC role with a passion so the gutting for ranged champs is not a surprise

hmasn37,CantReadGood_,11/27/2021,1,149.0,idk why it matters that youve never heard of the element chemtech.. This is Riots fantasy world and chemtech/hextech could very well be elements or basic expressions of magic in Runeterra. Idk why there needs to be any correlation with your expectations.. like even on a more relatable level - where would you find fire air rock water or old on the periodic table?
hmb7q9u,Vall3y,11/27/2021,1,38.0,The subtitles disappear too quickly wtf
hm9ima8,CLGHSGG4Lyfe,11/27/2021,1,33.0,best academy players shouldnt be in the Real Madrid of the league. They belong in the Digs and Fly Quests of the world.
hm9fnen,Prestonwww,11/27/2021,1,17.0,In that case absolutely. Its not a problem if youre having fun. This is more targeted towards players who take the game more seriously. Regardless of if youre high elo or low elo the game is mentally draining and unless you have the mental foritude of a fucking rock or a brick wall it usually ends up making you feel awful. At least in my experience.
hm95vcc,dannyboyheinz,11/27/2021,1,13.0,And just because you kiddies want a new map doesnt mean Riot should listen and ignore actual game problems lol
hmab6y1,Titanbeard,11/27/2021,1,408.0,Im genuinely getting attached to characters in the show because of how well its written and I did not expect that. Makes me want to play them more.   Viktor slowly losing his humanity is just as big of a draw as the action scenes too. Like they did so good with his body language and seeing the mental processes in his mannerisms.
hm9otrs,Oracle_1080,11/27/2021,1,5.0,theyre not.
hm9tf0k,Alex_Wizard,11/27/2021,1,36.0,The last Conquerer nerf was pretty harsh which left a lot of bruisers dropping pretty harshly in win rates. The new Lethal Tempo has essentially filled the void for many of them.

hm9bjla,Liyandri,11/27/2021,1,27.0,iirc the winter map was turned off by default in ranked. If people were complaining about accuracy in norms then theyve forgotten that League is a game that should be *enjoyed* and isnt just about winning (though judging by the state of the playerbase I cant say Im surprised)
hmc232b,hailcivciv,11/27/2021,1,285.0,yes bard is...something aurelion is literally the creator of universe and kindred is death. then you have half-gods/darkins aspects and demons which are veery hard to kill but they can be killed if im not wrong
hmbl9if,bobandgeorge,11/27/2021,1,,That depends if you think 4% is enough of a difference. Out of 100 games in which a soul is taken 87 of them will result in the team with the soul winning. Is it really that much more OP that 4 more of those games were a result of Chemtech soul?
hm9d8ee,BasicUsername_1,11/27/2021,1,15.0,Old mundo while basic was so much more fun because he felt so much more responsive and less slow and clunky (imo) new mundo feels like so much less of a carry and he’s not even a jungler anymore which is where I played him most. I had 70k points on old mundo in like a month or 2 after the rework I played one game and haven’t since.   Depends on your playstyle ig I feel if you liked old mundo you are less likely to like new mundo than someone who didn’t like old mundo just because the champ feels so much different aside thematically
hm9q9fn,_ug_,11/27/2021,1,,Malphite is bigger
hm9ryhi,awaythrowouterino,11/27/2021,1,226.0,The wig kinda fucks it but I dont expect someone to grow ankle length hair just for a cosplay. Still I think itd look better with natural inaccurate hair but its still amazing!
hmba11e,Schlectify,11/27/2021,1,9.0,Seeing as none of the leaders of noxus have mustaches i would say they definitely arent mustache twirlers. But beside that point i definitely see them as more of the morally gray area than straight up bad guys. Demacia has slowly become one of my most hated places in runeterra because of the prejudice towards mages.
hma32p9,BobMarciano,11/27/2021,1,41.0,Taliyahs passive is also bugged with banshee  and her Q still bugged too...
hm8x93h,skilledspellz,11/27/2021,1,10.0,Anyone who saw this game - why did he go timewarp tonic? bit of a strange choice for jhin no? did he start corrupting or it was just for an initial boots+4 start?
hmd87me,Zorrodx,11/27/2021,1,535.0,Seems like jack of all trades master of none multiple roles. Probably aren’t great at one thing and judging by the quality of the champions I’d say silver

hma3y5e,bearugh,11/27/2021,1,9.0,I am so confused and genuinely curious what the hell you mean by vi replaced by sett.  Also I played hearthstone for 6ish years and riots shit or lack of content is nothing compared to hearths drip feed of dog shit patches nerfing decks no one wanted nerfed and not nerfing the most broken hangouts shit for 6 months.  Like at gala shaman or even evolve rabbit shaman with they did the weird lets have random willd cards on standard for a few months. They actually just made ranked so unplayable that the numbers actually plumited.

hmbplkk,Lethioon,11/27/2021,1,156.0,He used to be in very very early days since he was in every single cinematic and promotional art for some reason but Riot probably reliazed he is not marketable enough when they became a real business. So they put him in shelve.

hmcy6mx,SterbenVII,11/27/2021,1,87.0,Yes.   Mid lane: OMG Creme or NS Gori  Support: FPX Academy Shenyi with Mikyx as a back up.   It’s really sad that Mikyx got done dirty like this and is left without an LEC slot despite being a top 2 support in EU for 5 seasons. He only had one bad split and is now out of the league. There are obviously 4-5 other good supports in the league but support isn’t nearly as stacked as ADC.

People do it all the time.    It does have to be either/or.  If you looked at Adam and Upsets version of the story there was an obvious disconnect in terms of what Adam felt was communicated vs what Upset felt was communicated.  The whole ‘Upset doesn’t owe Adam’ anything crowd is also ignoring the ‘Adam doesn’t owe Upset anything’ and can tweet whatever the fuck he wants.  And why would you be duo queue with your wife when Fnatic was playing in groups?  Doesn’t upset realize how bad the optics would look?  Just do it on a new account if you need to.

hmac0kj,Odd_Play_5769,11/27/2021,1,83.0,The 100 range isnt that broken especially considering you have to auto in your initial attack range to get it. with how much engage there is today especially with predator meta there are very rarely games where you can utilize that extra 100 range fully. Its strong in theory but jn practice at least in the games Ive played not yet.   Whereas a melee can get 90% attack speed level 1 and this attack speed is permanent so long as they keep autoing a champ.   Im not sure where OP is getting his information because according to patch notes the implication is lethal was changed to be viable for melee champs not so it would be better on ADCs. It was already perhaps the unironic most balanced rune in the game before it was reworked. Shame it changed

hm9fbky,Dastu24,11/27/2021,1,13.0,This might have something to it my only problem with this is that i was stuck in silver battling silvers and low golds for a very long time with 53% winrate. The moment my friend got new acc and we played few games we got matched with plats and dia and our winrate scyrocketed - 65% (there were no more trolls afks and so on we had like on in 70 games before it was 1/5 games pretty stabily)  And all this because the new acc got high mmr so we would face better people (in the same flex elo)

hm9xzgv,TheSoupKitchen,11/27/2021,1,53.0,HoB is nearly identical in winrate (slightly bettet) and PTA is arguably his best Rune.  Lethal tempo is intended for long drawn out fights (of which league gets less and less every year with more damage...) HoB and PTA are for burst and since twitch is more about stealth and burst right now Id say Lethal tempo is fine but the other 2 are better.

hm97mss,RitoBuffTalonPls,11/27/2021,1,58.0,I dont really understand why you hate him. He s not even that strong. Like most people call him a lane bully when in fact he is not that strong. Like his power comes when he hits an early stun lvl 1 and he has Dorans Blade. But other than that he doesnt do very much. His kit is telegraphed af. Dont stay in a minion wave or you are getting stunned and he throws some auto attacks on you chunking off a little but of your healthbar. Aside from his autos his damage comes from his W which is predictable and dodgeable. Like it literally screams STOP HITTING ME YOUR THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE YOU LL GET HIT BY SOME TRUE DAMAGE. His counter is that he gets kited into oblivion. Like literally you have 2 options:  -either A you engage with your ultimate your team follows you you stun 2-3 people from the enemy team and you win the teamfight or -B you engage but you die miserablly because you lack any form of mobility. He cant 1  v 5 after he uses his W he just dies and his W can be easilly avoided by simplly side stepping the ability. His laning phase is usually the part where he shines. Other than that his teamfighting is mediocre.

hma549e,fojek17,11/27/2021,1,47.0,This analogy doesnt really work for league.   I completely agree with it but it just doesnt apply to league. Heres an analogy from me:  If I enjoy going to the theater that doesnt mean I have to enjoy watching every single play ever made. On the other hand the fact that I do not enjoy it doesnt mean that I am allowed to kick everyone out of the theater regardless whether they enjoy it or not. We are only allowed to leave the theather together as a group and as such everyone should have a say whether they want to watch it until the end or not. I myself might not like the play but I should respect the fact someone else in the audience might be feeling like he is watching the best play of his life.  See the problem with your type of thinking is that is completely devoid of empathy. Someone might hate the play while others might love it. There might also be people who are interested in seeing the whole play just to see how the plot develops even though they did not like the first act. Your idea is that you are the only one with a valid and correct opinion and everyone else should adjust to it instead of making their own judgement on watching the play or not. If the play is shitty to you then everyone should leave the theatre and people who are enjoying the play are just troll who keep you hostage in the theatre

I was mostly thinking about something like that.  But with the popularity of Arcane penetrating mainstream they can totally expend it to be an event not tied to League esports and just as a musical festival celebrating Riot music.  Obviously if they do it it makes sense to put a huge focus on Arcanes music because its their most popular venture right now.  I want to hear Sting sing What Could Have Been live LOL.

The way I did it was by playing a few champions went into Practice Mode and took some time reading their abilities their items (the in-game recommendations are great for new players since online guides can be overwhelming at times) and with time it started clicking. Yes reading isnt the most thrilling thing in the world but youd be surprised how a few words can change the way you look at the game.     If youre going to do that I HIGHLY recommend starting with mechanically simple champions so you can focus on other things. I started with some advanced champions and for a while that held me back until I understood what the heck was going on. Also when in Practice press Esc for game options go to Interface and look for Always show extended Tooltips. Abilities items and such will show more numbers and details thatll help you understand how things work.

hmcea2h,JevonP,11/27/2021,1,6.0,The main thing that defines whether a champ will go mid or support is their base damages and scaling.   Take zyra for example. She has low Ability Power (AP) Ratios and high base damages on her abilities. This means she functions as a champion even with low gold income and can therefore go support which accrues the least gold value and exp throughout the match.   Finally champions who have higher ratios benefit greatly from levels and/or gold are going to be played mid where they can both scale and exert the most pressure on the map with their increased power.

hm9v33r,hiccup333,11/27/2021,1,12366.0,Its not what the creators intended but that is how it came across.  Like failures of execution of character moments.  The punch seemed way overdone and out of character for Vi even for what Jinx did.  Also after years of not seeing Jinx after they got captured by Ekko she goes with them at first to the surface (as far as the bridge) instead of immediately wanting to find Jinx.  Then she leaves her again for Caitlyn.  I was super invested in the sisters relationship so this was all disappointing to see

hm9aw9b,NattyGainz,11/27/2021,1,158.0,So just wanna add if you’re MMR is high that means opponents are better as well. Let’s say you have play MMR and you end up silver (so system will give you big LP gains to catch up nice right?). Except if you have to play MMR while you have inflated your rank. It means you will likely win less than 50% and might have a negative winrate despite having good LP gains.   Your rank will sooner or later always end up matching your skill.

hmaf9yw,Frakcherd,11/27/2021,1,1845.0,Jayce is shown to be physically capable hes worked as a smith his entire life as a child he used to play with a hammer the size of him that wasnt powered by hextech (which seems to make objects lighter). Also its a lot easier to dodge a punch than you think if youre concentrating on the person in front of you. When hes using the hammer form hes only got to worry about his front and back because hes on a bridge. Also its easy to aim an explosion.   I feel like the enforcers probably couldnt help their weapons were shown to be ineffective against the Chemtanks so theyd likely have done other things (Like round up the workers and try not to get killed) while the two people who were capable of damaging them fought. The lack of clarity with positioning also makes sense as it gives you the feeling that the focal point of the fight Jayce doesnt know whats going on. It helps to emphasise the fact that hes in the fog of war all the way up until he kills the kid. Its an immediate snap back to reality with the establishing shots of the positions of everyone else.

Mid lane for example you have support/artillery Lux. Pick/Safe Ahri. And Nimble/Assassin Fizz  Like Fizz? Ekko Kat Zed will be your next branches. Lux will go into Viktor Orianna and Syndra. Ahri will go towards things like Vex Zoe and Lissandra.   Etc etc you get the idea

hma2nwr,delahunt,11/27/2021,1,12388.0,I love that everything that happens in Arcane gets traced back to Jayce doing illegal dangerous research in his apartment with shitty security. Every plot point comes naturally from that first one. The only hiccup is Vi leaving Ekko to handle Jinx at the end of episode 7 and that is relatively minor.

hmad2j0,delahunt,11/27/2021,1,12395.0,So what I think I love about Arcane is that it is simultaneously both and neithers fault.  There are 2 points where the relationship could maybe have been saved:    * Vi doesnt leave Powder in episode 3 (both die to Silco and Goons most likely)  * Vi stays instead of Ekko in episode 7  Because by the time Vi gets out of Jail Jinx has had years with Silco grooming her. And there is no quick way to get past that. Anything Vi says is going to get twisted. It is going to be near impossible for Vi to convince Jinx she didnt know about the gemstone especially when shes working with a Pilty.  And Vi is looking for Jinx from the get go. That is basically what she is doing from the moment she gets out. She thinks Silco is holding Powder hostage. She doesnt find out until meeting Ekko that Powder is Jinx by choice.  So what you have is Jinx suffering from the fear shes never good enough (all the way from episode 1) and her abandonment complex after episode 3. She is unable to parse what is going on because she just sees Vi choosing something else over her (Caitlyn mostly.)  And Vi is trying to get through to her sister and get time but things keep getting in the way. Or the situation is so fucked its not like she really has a choice. The best time she has to talk to Jinx is when shes tied down and Jinx is already pretty unhinged and jumping from topic to topic while also having the ghosts of Mylo and Claggor ripping into her and twisting everything.  The bridge scene is the only part that is weird to me. Because Vi goes from I cant leave her again to doing just that. Which is weird because the whole plan was Ekko/Caitlyn present the stone to Jayce. And had it been Vi injured badly instead of Cait I could see it better.  But for Vi the tragedy is one moment of weakness - at a very justifiable time - basically sent the only family she had left on a very dangerous path. And Vi is trying to get through but Jinx is *very* far gone even before Silcos death. Thats not something you get through quickly.

hma16hy,tanezuki,11/27/2021,1,70.0,>From what I see nasus players just tend to sit on the bramble cus they get what they want and it lets them rush more important items like frozen and spirit. If you dont benefit from finishing thornmail dont get it till 6 items and hope someone on your team gets anti heal.  Thats exactly this but you still need the item when youre splitpushing. Splitpushers always have high sustain value and not having Bramble against them is suicidal. In end game splitpush doesnt work so Ill agree you have to rely on others to build it. Which is kinda annoying when Riot decided to make sure everyone would get access to anti heal in the first place.   About Yas and company its just an example to show being part of a class doesnt mean being forced into specific items. Rengar is a diver fighter yet everyone knows hes built as an assassin.

hma0tba,Random_Stealth_Ward,11/27/2021,1,70.0,I think the idea is that the GW Proc may be seen as too strong if it was on any CC while the shield from fimbul isnt Probably because fimbul is a self-contained effect only applied on the user while thornmails GW arent and with how easily available Slows are it means everyone gets to apply the 60% with little compromise since slow effects are tacked on many spells specially on a ton of tanks.  For example if you are Poppy you get a 60% gw on every Q Nautilus presses E and a circle the size of an Amumu ult now gets 60% GW Tham in every Q Maokai throws a sapling and thats a 60% GW if you are Sion a tap Q or a minion E is the 60% GW since so many of these effects have a moderately big AOE or ranges along with lower CD to balance out their lower utility contribution it could be seen as too out of line.  Juggernauts just happen to be caught in the middle of this as a result of their designs

An example: what makes Vayne and Fiora so painful for tanks and juggernauts and bruisers is their %hp true damage so a good solution would be (for Vayne) to reduce her W damage and increase her E damage/increase her E stun duration/increase her Qs dash length (so she lives up to her short-range kite ADC fantasy) or (for Fiora) to reduce her passives damage/Q attacks range but make her W %HP magic damage if she parries CC/enhance her E AS cripple if it hits a vital or in general.

hmbjdn2,TitanDweevil,11/27/2021,1,13.0,>The dodge penalty is questionable enough due to the omnipresence of players who are supremely unpleasant in low rank play and the numerous accounts higher rank players tend to have.  That dodge penalty was put in place to stop people from dodging every time they got an unfavorable match up or their team comp looked worse in order to climb.  From personal experience it was a massive problem in high elo there was a decent amount of people who would dodge every time the game looked tough.  This inflated the queue times and it also allowed people to climb to a much higher rank than their actual skill due to abusing dodges.    >Make counter-picking less decisive so that people no longer feel like dodging a bad draft is necessary.  The whole point of the change was to stop people dodging bad drafts or tough match ups.  Draft is part of the game.  Some champions arent safe blind picks and if your team blind picks it and gets countered then Im sorry to say it but tough luck.  If you are scared of getting counter picked then pick a safe champion or ask for a swap.  If you dont play any safe champions or cant get a swap then learn how to manage the match up.  The match ups arent unplayably impossible like season 2 Pantheon vs Gangplank there is always something you can do especially considering completely ignoring lane and roaming around the map fighting is a viable solo queue strategy still (somehow this hasnt been nerfed after 3 years).  Most of the time you arent playing with the same people in low elo so Im almost certain that the unpleasant people you are referring to would be people who play champions you consider bad or off meta.  This change was made to stop people from dodging in those cases in order to climb faster so if you are upset that you cant do it anymore without getting punished then its working as intended.

hmapaa4,MoonDawg2,11/27/2021,1,28.0,Only use ult to start a teamfight (getting a pick) or end a teamfight. That or youre too away to have any impact.  Other than that just going in and out with autos is better most of the time.  Jhin is likely the easiest adc atm you just need a few ground rules like any other.

Well I havent quit yet and dont plan to anytime soon because I love the game and want to hit certain milestones.  If you really enjoy the game I dont see any issue with keeping on playing it as long as you have fun.
hmcaxa3,Silver-Alex,11/27/2021,1,12406.0,Oh dang that Zavika scene was AWESOME. Yeah I really loved Silco one of my fav characters of the series if not the favorite.

The objective gold is so good for them because all it takes is one or two towers to drop and they just instantly outscale you even if you were ahead prior to that.   This patch if you dont have hypercarries you essentially have 3 choices:  - Close out fast (not gonna happen in low elo solo queue)   - Secure hexsoul  - Lose

hmd7kry,Lawbakgoh,11/27/2021,1,21.0,Is this true? New players start in iron for ranked? I did horribly but started in high bronze.  I ended up playing ranked and fell to iron so I was surprised they didn’t start me in iron.  I got flamed a lot as a new player playing ranked but it was because I didn’t know much about the game at the time.    After playing more and learning I climbed from low iron to silver.

hma2u0y,LeThomsen,11/27/2021,1,149.0,Didnt most of them already decided before that game that they wanted something new? The rosterchange wasnt something completly new to them as far as I understood.   I dont think Bwipo had to flee I think it was time for him no matter what and he knew.  And the nisqy situation was stupid not Upsets fault but time and bad planning was to blame.
hmcezlo,Yonaka_Kr,11/27/2021,1,235.0,Only current hp% vs the enemy so if Im at 3k hp tank and I take 2000 damage before using Gargoyles or w/e and the enemy adc is still at full HP at 2100 hp youd get the full 20% damage amp as a tank vs the adc with your first hit while my Gargoyles shields keeps me alive.  In fact its stronger vs bruisers (who stack mainly just HP with Gore/DS + Steraks) than it is tanks who get lots of resistances or stuff like Gargoyles.  Its also much more valuable than Infernal drake on tanks like an Amumu with 0 AP is going to get like 4 AD off a single Infernal drake. Versus a potential 5% damage when you are low health.  So no tanks do benefit.

hmaa39a,FantasyTrash,11/27/2021,1,311.0,Have you ever considered the people are allowed to choose which private matters they share with their job? As long as your manager (or in this case Yamato/Dardo) know there is no obligation for you to share any further if you choose not to and that should be respected.  Because when it’s not respected we get posts like Adam’s and opinions from players like Doublelift which is the very thing Upset wanted to avoid. Just because you’re a public figure doesn’t mean you can’t have privacy.

hm9hqbt,K1ndr3dSoul,11/27/2021,1,32.0,With a therapist all they can really do is talk to me about strategies or be vented to. Its all on me 100% to do anything and I feel I already have strategies or coping mechanisms (which arent enough for me to be where I want to be but neither are theirs) so I dont see the point.    Im content with my life with the only exception being that Im NEET and find most jobs to be too stressful or overwhelming (even with medication. It just makes me happy in my default state of NEET) so Ive just stayed home (parents not into that so they kicked me out after dropping out of University so Ive just been living with whoever Im dating at the time). It sucks not having spending money and relying on others but Im just not very functional in workplaces I tried.

Do you think I just dashed past my co-workers without saying a word and left? No. I informed them that something bad had happened with my grandfather and then left.  See in real life where professionalism is actually required of you muh privacy is not a valid reason for anything.  In fact I was just gone for half a day imagine having to leave my co-workers for weeks during the hardest period of the year without any explanation because I didnt trust them? What the hell does that even mean?   In what profession do you think its okay for you to just leave for weeks let alone leave without saying anything to your team?
hmd3n7s,BuckSleezy,11/27/2021,1,274.0,If that’s the reason I’m more pissed that tryndamere is still completely untouched.

hmc27zr,luiluilui4,11/27/2021,1,12.0,I wonder what RP amount would be profitable for riot to design map skins. Maybe like partial map skins could be a thing. E.g. Northern east jungle Shadow isles or  southern west beach party bilgewater bot lane targons top lane piltover and damacian base ionia midlane  Might be a bigger balancing challenge than with champion skins but I would totally spend legendary skin worth of RP for such a partial skin map  If they really put effort into this and not make it look like a cheap chroma it might actually give the game a design increase that it didnt have for a long time. I am talking about designs even better than most of the time limited map skins they had for gamemodes and events

There are plenty of people that are stuck in iron/bronze because they have a disability of some form be it physical or mental. Of course there is nothing wrong with that.   Spending around 5000 hours on a single champion and still not making it even close to rank of the average player definitely makes it sound like there is in fact  something wrong with the player.

hmcsm9b,CreepyMosquitoEater,11/27/2021,1,456.0,Opponents teammates experience. Also any statistics website i look at has a lethal tempo page as the highest winrate for Yasuo. Top players make mathematical mistakes all the time so relying on them for advice on optimal builds is usually wrong. They are arguing solely from feeling as well top yasuo player that everyone mentions doesnt like it so thats his personal feeling and personal playstyle.   Dont get me wrong i think 14 ad at lv 1 and 28 ad at lv 18 IS a lot but i think 90% attack speed at all ranks and a range increase is A LOT MORE.   Plenty of things are considered BROKEN that arent viable or crazy strong in the controlled environment of professional play so whether something is broken or not is all relative to the context. So if a specific top challenger yasuo player doesnt like it it doesnt mean that it isnt broken for the majority of the playerbase.   Obviosly i havent played enough games with or against is or as it but like i said in a previous comment we can only wait for more statistics to come out. If conqueror ends up showing stronger results in the long run than lethal sure i would be wrong but right now everyone is taking it people seem to be winning more with is based on statistics and it looks and seems way stronger than conqueror in a generality of elos (not the single yasuo mains challenger games that you are referencing).
hm9nvob,usuckusuckusuckusuck,11/27/2021,1,6.0,As a user it would be great but I can understand why they dont do it from a businessstandpoint.  Sadly I dont own many of the skins I would love a Chroma for and now Im debating if I just buy the skins or hope for some RNG luck to buy them next year.

hm9shjl,TymurXoXo,11/27/2021,1,2.0,The bounties don’t come from simple gold difference. If the enemy has 0 drakes and took 2 towers while you have 3 drakes and 3 towers and are just getting killed because your team comp sucks or you just can’t farm correctly they most likely won’t get triggered.
hm9z6zy,tanezuki,11/27/2021,1,70.0,> Tk has his R for cc and a stun on q once in a while. Not much more than darius or nasus.  Well you say not much more than Nasus but he can applies Thornmail in comparison.   I really dont understand why Thornmail is like this and isnt just working in the same way as some others GW items where the only difference is the amount of HP of the target. Every enchanter has a heal/shield and every marskman has access to autoattacks. But not every tank has access to hard CCs.

hmcw09f,DevastaTheSeeker,11/27/2021,1,37.0,No Im not looking for a wrapup every episode. I want an overall wrapup at the end. There are so many lines for them to follow in a season 2 that they dont need to leave on a bad cliffhanger. Theres the viktor stuff the noxus stuff ekko singed. They didnt need to end mid climax.
hmcwrzr,LucasSmithsonian,11/27/2021,1,93.0,No Noxus is NOT a nice place to live. Its a place where the weak are oppressed and treated like dirt and while those with value rise high in society the can just as easily be cast out or murdered (see Mel and her brother for example). Them making Demacia morally gray didnt make Noxus somehow a decent place Noxus is still a shithole that uses child soldiers weapons of mass destruction and is insanely imperialistic. They are still morally black and Demacia was made morally gray so its at least a bit more interesting.
hmamwqe,MoonDawg2,11/27/2021,1,140.0,Were still the worst class with the worst representation in challenger despite being one of the most popular. Items for adc themselves is decent not too bad but nothing too good either. Weve been hard forced to go crit 90% of the time when crit is now kinda shit and the band-aid fix we got was collector which is also shit but still better than a seal item second for pretty much every crit adc minus jinx.  Honestly the issue is the 2 item spikes. It just fucking sucks regardless of what adc youre playing and the 2-3 item spikes are the most important in the game. The situational itemisation is realistcally the choice of going GA 4th or LDR 4th. I dont think Ive deviated from that almost the entire season because there is realistically nothing else to build. Wtf situational itemisation are you even talking about really?  Also the issue on LDR is that you end up lacking damage on squishies while not doing much better against tanks. Rolling a crit on a squishy with infinity is just too important on teamfights since good adc players will fish for damage on the backline and a small ldr crit doesnt really do much. It is actually a pretty meh item in practice unless massively ahead or ONLY focusing a tank theres a reason builds with ldr third or second have lower winrates.  Items themselves are fine-ish but when compared to shit like steraks lethality the new mage/tank items or gore drinker theyre underwhelming to say the least. The issue is that they cant be changed or buffed because of cancer bruisers abusing them and the only hope I had for this season was some changes for runes but again its underwhelming to say the least. Lethal is meta defining atm but the adc that can actually abuse it when compared to other roles is minute.

Its not like you have to scan through the code for years to find that bug neither was that bug introduced in a big patch that might be connected to some deep engine changes.

hm9b81k,Voshin,11/27/2021,1,12.0,When you send a ticket if they see nothing particularly wrong I dont think they do.. If you reported after the game then thats when they see the chat logs if it gets to manual review. As much as it is fucked up they literally cant deal with every case of verbal abuse. Theres millions and millions of players using different word variations to avoid detection. The only thing I would suggest is:  1. Either mute all chats from the beginning. 2. If you dont mute from the start as soon as you see someone like that dont feed them they literally are trying to make you mad. Theres no point responding just mute everyone. 3. And if you send tickets again Id suggest screenshoting the actually racist parts. In my 8 years of playing Ive sent 2 tickets because someone was being extremely offensive and twice they got back at me that the person was dealt with.
hmbpssg,wo0topia,11/27/2021,1,225.0,Well there three likely reasons why they dont anymore.  1. Its only winter for the northern hemisphere so maybe its to be more inclusive.  2.

Climate change in runeterra has created warmer winters with less snow.
hm9uyau,TymurXoXo,11/27/2021,1,31.0,Here’s a hot take: they don’t.  If the game is really lost by 15 minutes than it won’t last much longer so conceding doesn’t really matter.  What’s more common is the early lead being pushed for 5 minutes and the game being lost by the 20 minutes mark. At this point… the feeding teammate doesn’t have a vote? You only need 4 people to agree on conceding so if all the other people agree you will FF anyway.  Or is your point about if 1 teammate feeds you should be able to concede with a 4 man vote and 3/4 yes? So that if two people are behind in game a toxic premade can just ff ruining the game for other 8 people??   Like what’s your point?? If the game is lost one person will never be able to hold you in game and if you have two feeding teammates then the game will not last long anyway?
hma2w2h,Mejalu,11/27/2021,1,34.0,They pull their starters to avoid injury. If they were invulnerable theres a 100% chance they would be in the whole game.

hmc5nx4,JohnCornewaille,11/27/2021,1,346.0,In a series like Arcane Sylas most likely would most likely be the antagonist that actually has a valid point that people ignore to maintain status quo but the way he runs things is what differentiates him to the protagonist (most likely Lux) akin to Killmonger in Black Panther.  The way I believe Damacias story would go would be with Lux influencing the change as she herself discovers her place in the world in her personal character arc. Sure there would be various other characters either changing to support her (Garen Jarvan Tiana Sylas the Buvelles) while other would oppose it with everything they had (Mageseekers powerful political figures of Damacia The Black Rose probably also Tiana).

Unless you have to play vs the shittiest comps like 5 ADCs while you have tanks and a healer it wont do jackshit.

hm9oraf,EvesLostInches,11/27/2021,1,94.0,I think she drops aggro tho? Not sure. I haven’t played her a lot this pre season. If i turret dive and the turret aggro will kill me cause i didn’t get out fast enough i ult and that ends up saving me. Idk if i misunderstood the question/ if you end up failing to ult out of turret range thats a different story

By the time he was diamond he had a solid grasp of his champs. Before that was a crapshoot. That’s why his top and jungle challenge he was barely above 50% up until diamond.

hmamjyu,RaiseYourDongersOP,11/27/2021,1,90.0,I think so but I dont remember. Either way though thats a different kind of experience than Im talking about. Just look at his competition. Its Bwipo Dhokla (who was in LCS and been playing for awhile) and Srrty (on an amateur team I think and is actively trying to go pro it seems like). General Sniper is good in SoloQ but idk if he actually wants to go pro so compared to the competition its hard to tell what will happen.
hm96x6y,MystixStix,11/27/2021,1,23.0,Ashe Garen and other champs that only cost 450 are usually quite easy and great for learning the game
hm9bk3j,Houson2k,11/27/2021,1,158.0,So you first talk about ranks and how people MUST HAVE ANY IDEA about the game they play and when proven otherwise you go into who cares 4fun game anyway?  Also OP saying it took him 6 years he was just moved upwards with mmr inflation going since s8 safe to assume he didnt improve at all.  Master tier 1/0lp throughout the years shows how many people are being pushed upwards.  Grats for him but maybe other people understand that you SHOULD climb within 6 years with what league rank has become since s8 even if you didnt improve whatsoever.
hmcw7vl,RemoteAnalysis3809,11/27/2021,1,317.0,People be acting like what the US is doing in the Middle East what Britain did in India and what France was and still is doing in Africa doesnt rival the Chinese scale. Also as someone from a developing country theres a reason why many people from the developing world in Africa and SEA view Chinas rise with hope that someday we can do the same. People on Reddit (young native English speakers mostly from the US and Europe) act like no one benefit from Chinas rise but the CCP when the Chinese middle class have unironically experienced the most drastic change in standard of living in the shortest amount of time in modern history. And maybe they still dont rival the western Europe/American standard of living but its much better than a good chunk of the world that are still suffering from abject poverty war and political instability some of which are indirectly caused by the same empires that arent so evil yet still spend billions of dollars per year fucking over people on the other side of the planet for geopolitical influence.

hmcaiaw,Rechulas,11/27/2021,1,1.0,Sorry I dont remember any mentions of BLE. Could you link me some so I can look into it a bit better?  People theorize that Act 1 of Arcane is before the Noxian invasion of Ionia and that somewhere inbetween Act 1 and 2 the invasion goes off and finalizes. The theory stems from Swain being a bit more militant and requesting weapons to stop the threat he sees so he sent out Mrs. Medarda or something like that.  The actual invasion takes place between 984 AN and 989 AN. Powder was about 11-12 years old in Act 1 and in other acts seems to be 17-19 about? So the time checks out at least. Not too sure if it *really* makes sense but with talk of Noxus in the later Acts its sorta easy to see the connections at least.  Having said that I think Season 2 (provided it still focuses on Piltover and Zaun) will almost definitely use Warwick and maybe tease/showcase Urgot building his cult. Ziggs at some point should start hanging out with Jinx  Considering Zaun has a lot of Shuriman influences (or it did at least) Shurima might get a spotlight specifically the mining of the Brackern.    Camille was born 916 AN so using the timeline then shes definitely up and atem probably already the Principle Intelligencer for Clan Ferros enforcing their deals.

First Ill just say this dude is a trash teammate if this is how he handles adversity in sports. No budging on this. If you ever played sports in any solid organized level - it is _never_ about you and your tantrums. It is 100% all buy in. And throw your body into the gears to win.   Second this dude might have an actual social/personality problem if this is the way he handles shit in a professional career.   Third when awkward ass Video Game Kids need to be social to execute as a team and they cant do it - and the teammates and staff cant get them to operate as a PROFESSIONALLY PAID player... This sport is a fucking Clown Town.  Sucks for FPX because they had an awesome roster.  But this dude sounds like he has a severe social problem. Id never want this dude on my team. I dont give a fuck how good he is. Gimgoon won a title at lesser skill because he operates as a teammate _better_ in FPX.

hmbd244,tanezuki,11/27/2021,1,91.0,>But then you get melted by % hp damage right? Because you’re stacking health? Sure you can argue you’d take less % physical damage but that doesn’t stop % hp magic damage (cough Liandry’s cough Demonic).  The thing is AP machine guns like Cass or Ryze are way less common as archetypes in AP champions rather than AD champions who have marksmen whos whole class is made for this. And even then I will build MR items just later down the line.  Obviously against direct AP match ups I will go MR items like Spirit Visage or other MR tank items depending on what I need but all those items have their passive working on everyone so that wasnt my focus here.  I play Nasus and Sett more than Cho the flair is just a meme. Nasus Sett Cho being my mains top even though the rest of my champions are on other lanes (Lux main aswell but not top obv).  For Darius ok I dont play him. I dont see that item picked often though and people definetely pick Darius often when I pick Nasus (Camille being a must ban atm).
hmbk7ta,NotAStatistic2,11/27/2021,1,154.0,Dont get me started on the Swain rework. My boy used to strike fear into the hearts of top lane tanks and junglers attempting ganks. Now people only play him bot lane because he gets destroyed by every champ in solo lanes :(

hmdbdfk,loldraftingaid,11/27/2021,1,4.0,The inherent subjectivity of this answer makes this a pointless question for anyone to answer.

Gates being placed whole invisible swaths just lots of things making each season more visibly different than the last.  No real energy devoted to addressing healing creep (that is worse with a zombie state on each champ) insane overkill (which is also worse now) and blatantly creating new drakes that absolutely make the old ones shit (Cloud drake is still insanely shit and could be deleted with nobody being upset.). All this said with 6 drakes the least they could do is buff individual drakes and nerf their soul counterpart.  Otherwise those first 2 drakes will rarely matter.

They said this in 2019 before bringing back the event and chromas. They didn’t do this in 2020 the rumour at the time was that because it didn’t sell well in China they just didn’t do it. I have no facts to back that up it was just opinion at the time.

We really could have had an Arcane sized show based around just about any group of League champs. I love Arcane but I’m a little sad about the Noxius vs Ionia missed opportunity.   Almost every single champ in the game is the main character of at least a few stories unless you’re Heimer in which case you’re doomed to watch everything unfold while everyone ignores your warnings.

hmah7ty,KogMawOfMortimidas,11/27/2021,1,116.0,Lethal Tempos range bonus for ADCs is only noticeable when the team is ahead when behind the ADC is mostly fighting people off themselves. A range increase does nothing when bruisers and assassins are sitting on your face. People get dicked a handful of times by a lethal tempo Jinx that they let freely reset and run around the fight and think that the rune is broken on ranged but dont bat an eye at getting run down by everyone and their mother using predator or how conqueror was being used by like 6 out of 10 people in each game.  Whats really the problem is Yasuo and Yone (and slightly less so Tryndamere). These melee ADCs ruin everything for everyone. They stop Riot from properly balancing Crit chance and Crit damage ADC items Shieldbow IE Mortal Reminder fucking everything. The double crit passive for both of them is just fucking ridiculous Ive done the math on it before but here we go again. Yasuo and Yone at 2 items (Shieldbow and IE) have 100% crit chance for 1.89x damage (1.89x overall DPS increase) vs anyone else with 2 items having 40% chance for 1.75x damage (1.3x overall DPS increase). This alone means Yasuo and Yone are doing 45% MORE DPS than any normal champion on auto attacks alone. Next Yasuo and Yone can reliably weave 2 autos between each Q which has a 1.33s cooldown. This means they are landing 3 attacks (2 autos + 1 Q) every 1.33s or 2.25 attacks per second. Now with Lethal Tempo if they can weave 3 autos in between they would be reaching 3 attacks per second on average. Most other ADCs at 2 items are maybe in the 1.5-2 attacks per second range if they got Zeal second although many go LDR and so wont achieve that level of attack speed. Thus Yasuo and Yone attack at least ~28% faster than other ADCs at 2 items. Yasuo also ignores 50% of the bonus armor of his target basically a free LDR and Yone does half magic damage making armor itemization against him less effective and also amplifies damage by 25-35% in his E.   Adding all that bullshit up Yasuo and Yone are outputting up to twice as much in terms of DPS compared to anyone else just twice as much raw damage not even starting on their mobility CC Windwall shielding everything else. This doubled DPS translates to doubled lifestealing which is why the anime bros abuse Shieldbow so hard. You cant balance Shieldbow and lifesteal for ADCs without Yasuo and Yone just ruining it for everyone. They love the shield love the stats and can draintank anyone with massive DPS converting to massive healing. Just remove their double crit passive please. Its ruined everything. Lethal Tempo looks so ridiculous on them because they are already ridiculous.

hmd9vmo,Jarvjon,11/27/2021,1,170.0,Uh you realize teams with better players in every role other than Mid + adc got spanked by 100T in playoffs right? Sorry to break it to you but Hauntzer and Sven have fallen off hard. And a “random sup” like zeyzal bio (yeh he on dig I kno) would get exposed hard af especially if they don’t know when to roam effectively cause then it’s just 3v1/3v2 mid on cds.
hmayz43,Arkaidan8,11/27/2021,1,206.0,Because Gwen players are so extremely elo inflated its basically unrecoverable. She was broken for far too long it screwed up their brains and mmrs way too much.  They cant figure out that after the nerfs they cant out statcheck everyone after purposely missing the entirety of their Qs and after using their W for swag before the fight even starts.
hmckj62,Prince_Zinar,11/27/2021,1,440.0,I feel like theres a lot of main characters in Runeterra but Ryze is the highest one in the hierarchy.  Ryze is the MC for Runeterra as a whole.  Jinx and Vi for Piltover/Zaun.  Ezreal is kinda a Runeterra main character too since he goes around looking for magic items and getting himself almost killed but since he appears to be in Shurima he is the main character in Shurima. That or Taliyah which would make more sense but Ezreal has the mc vibe.  Swain Darius and LB are the main trio of Noxus.  Lux is the main character for Demacia I am pretty sure that was obvious.  Ashe for the Freljord same case as Lux its just obvious.  In Bilgewater I guess its Miss Malcolm and Tobias being a pretty close second.  Targon has... Tyari? Even tho theyre not a champion. Theyre the aspect of the Traveler so it would make sense.  Ixtal has a total of 1 character therefore Qiyana is the main character.  The main character for Ionia could be Akali it makes sense since shes not relevant enough to be special like Shen or Zed but not as irrelevant as yordles. And no im not talking about Kennen.

hmc99dq,Distinger_,11/27/2021,1,8.0,And you not experiencing it does not make it the vast majority of players. I did not say anywhere that this is happening to everyone either youre just making things up.  Given how big the playerbase is around 11 million players even if it happens to only 5% of it it can mean its affecting 500k people.
hmcm9cq,Blue_Seraph,11/27/2021,1,,>Wrong. Most mages have 2 high winrates at 20-25 mark and 40+. Simply they are kings of mid game and hyper late game but there are transition phases when ADCs are stronger.  Not the case. Sample size for 40+ minutes games on 0.5% pickrate champions are just too few to establish a good trend. A lot of them might just be won over a random pick with mages being in general better at making or following picks than ADCs.  &#x200B  >Syndra 40+ has 58% winrate on botlane Karthus has highest winrate 40+ and 2nd highest 20-25 but has the worst winrate in early game. Swain has highest winrate at 35-40. Cassiopeia has fairly stable winrate until going to the sky at 40 mins.  Idk where you found those stats every site I consulted has Syndra with a subpar overall winrate with a slight spike barely grazing 50% wr at 40+ that is equal to her 15-20 min wr.   The only mage with an upward trend with time would be Cassiopeia.  &#x200B  > Just thing is opressivity of adc on mid ends on first few levels   Thats all it takes to put the enemy laner behind and prevent them from taking part in their roaming shenanigans without coinflipping the game. Marksmen arent oppressive on the map but extremely oppressive ***on the lane.***  &#x200B  >If ADC dmg was reliable they would dominate total dmg charts on lolalytics.  Completely false. The champions topping the damage charts are usually either poke champions or champions with a lot of wasted damage.  • Karthus is high because every time he throws a lot of AoE around and hits 5 enemies each time he ults. But a lot of that is effectively wasted damage ( Nasus with his passive and Yasuo with his vamp scepter dont really care about losing HP when you ulted the enemy Janna dead ) and his main dps tool ( his Q ) is one of the least reliable damage spells in the game.  • Ziggs is high because he is a poke champion with lots of AoE that typically builds Liandries racking up a ton of damage over time that often ends up not being that conclusive.  • Heimer and Viktor also throw a lot of AoE around but the first has limited control over his targets while the second still ***can*** miss his priority targets.  • Cassio is the first one on your list with a Marksman-like dps pattern shes the one with the most dps on your list ( doing even more damage than Marksmen ) and shes only n°21 well behind Draven of all champions.  • Ashes poke is ridiculously weak past laning phase. Varus has a relatively even split between is poke and dps build bringing his average damage per game down ( would be higher if he only went poke ).  • Lulu isnt even responsible for that big a part of Kogs damage over a whole game. Yes mid game she is but later on shes just very good at keeping him alive. So no assessing damage isnt counting two champs in one. KogMaw just has extremely high dps.  &#x200B  >Both of those ADCs unlike mages also dont provide any utility outside of slow meanwhile a lot of champions mentioned above has abilities that on their own without assist can change teamfights.  Thats part of the tradeoff. Less extreme and less reliable damage but better utility. You even see it on damage-focused mages like Cassio Karthus and Ryze who have even less utility than a lot of ADCs.  &#x200B  >Reliability of ADC is limited by how much his team protects him against how many enemy champions want to kill him and it soloq it is quite easy.  And sadly soloQ will be soloQ so of course the class with the least agency is gonna feel bad. But ridding Marksmen of that weakness is still gonna be a really bad idea. Theres a reason why the enemy champions wants to kill the Marksman in the first place and thats because not doing it in more cases than not means losing.  &#x200B  >Mage who is focused at least has zhonya  Yes and ADCs have overheal and Bloodthirster potentially making them a lot harder to take down than they look. Its not that uncommon to see an ADC tanking burst with only a sliver of HP remaining only to shred whomever is in range and finish the fight with more than 50-60% hp.  &#x200B  >Mages on average are quite good botlane they arent quite popular because most people are parroting meta from pro play where team comps actually can protect well around ADCs and make them good.  Except mages would be a lot worse botlane if they were popular because people would then expect them and play around them rather than be caught off guard.  Plus theres a reason why soloQ has also seen the Marksman + Supp bot meta cemented. Ever had a Lux or Xerath support come mid-late game and found yourself unable to deal with the enemy bruisers because your team lacks utility and wishing they had picked Janna or Lulu instead ? Or had someone decide to play Cassio bot but he sadly missed one Q during a teamfight nullifying his damage for 3 whole seconds and giving the enemy team the edge when a Jinx would have just straight up cut through them like butter ?  &#x200B  Well thats the thing. ADCs are ***reliable damage dealers***. They cant be given more utility or agency because their damage is ***too high*** and ***too reliable*** for it to work without it being broken. Asking for Marksmen to be given more agency and more solo carry potential for soloQ is basically asking for them to be shifted away from their identity as ranged autoattackers and be reworked into Ezreals Graves and Corkis with a lot less focus on pure AAing.   That is not doable without changing the classes identity entirely.

hmcl7qo,PandasakiPokono,11/27/2021,1,684.0,Gigabroken? How so? I dont see how making it so he cant dive tower for 5 whole seconds (or longer if hes at max hp) at Level 6 is a giga nerf that would require buff compensations considering at max fury he can kill you in 5 basics. Ghost and E prevents Tryndamere from being kited already and he can flash out or save his E to pop out of tower range right when his ult ends.

Now in the era of TFT LoR and Arcane which I called modern Riot: Jinx Ekko Ahri Yasuo and Lux are now the new poster characters  The ones who are consistent are mostly Ahri and Lux due to their visual appeal and their in-game popularity. Meanwhile Jinx and Ekko are eye candy character design and fits in well with the general demographic of the game which comprises mostly of teenagers and young adults whore in their mid 20s  Riot needs a consistent mascot for their company if I were them Id choose a Poro
hmcn5w0,Jstin8,11/27/2021,1,,That was also under Darkwill’s rule where Noxus went from “exalt the strong” to “trample the weak”.

There is absolutely 0 reason to not tell his teammates why he cannot attend the biggest reason why theyre playing the game. I cant see anything that happened be serious enough to not tell your team. Fuck telling the public but the team?   The only reason I see that he isnt telling them is that the reason isnt serious enough so he feels stupid. Then again I could be wrong I know absolutely nothing of his life except that he treated his team like shit.

hmbxu7s,KristyCat35,11/27/2021,1,52.0,0/7/0 isnt enough for calling feeding. It can be tipycal score for players who just have bad matchup and being camped mainly for ones who play on top because they have nowhere to run from his enemy. Int feeding is like 0/20/0
hm997hj,GameplayerStu,11/27/2021,1,155.0,Bwipo and Bjerg were free agents.
hmcqiwq,ARQEA,11/27/2021,1,490.0,Technically yea
hmcckzf,homer12346,11/27/2021,1,2.0,item haste affects ALL items in the game with a cooldown  ability haste is specifically made to work with stridebreaker and goredrinker as a special case
hm9lmkd,supterfuge,11/27/2021,1,166.0,From what insiders have told us players dont get their full salary if theyre not starting but a % of it. Obviously the bigger the player the higher the % of their  starting salary they have to be paid. But if Hans is benched next year and hes earning ~1.6M a year as a starter we can assume that hes NOT going to earn that next year.  Multiple people even said that what was so crazy about Hunis contract two years ago was that all of it was guaranteed regardless of his performance.  So one bad split/year and they are earning a lot less next year contract or not. Especially in a team like TL that doesnt give a fuck and will bench you first opportunity they get for someone slightly better.
hmasl5j,BBQMasterDad,11/27/2021,1,15.0,Technically yes under the old lore. New lore basically just has Ryze as a literal god that could destroy the world at any time he wishes due to the World Runes he’s been collecting to prevent others from abusing them. He’s basically a walking nuke.
hm90bx4,Whiskeyjacks_Fiddle,11/27/2021,1,12361.0,I mean Summoners Rift/League of Legends doesn’t actually exist in the current (relaunched 2014) lore so you can definitely have canonically dead characters in LoL.  Side note - this also allows the writers to potentially kill off champs in Arcane and other media.
hmaakwk,XIAOHANNAH,11/27/2021,1,52.0,Damwon won a title with him playing perfectly he is so strong as a player and a great teammate in korea
hm976m0,BBQMasterDad,11/27/2021,1,7.0,On a real note you shoulda been using your ult more that fight it’s free damage on reset and applies passive stacks. Additionally since Baron was free there you could’ve roamed mid and helped push out that wave to advance it/stack it for baron buff minions. Just some additional thoughts.
hmarra8,TommyWhatsHisNuts,11/27/2021,1,143.0,Kled Q no longer provides true sight during its tether since pre season. As well his remount time is 100% random in frame count
hm9tnek,oziryull,11/27/2021,1,22.0,Garensetttryndamere
hmaaf0k,Naymliss,11/27/2021,1,4.0,You will have more success on r/LeagueConnect  youll mostly get trolled here.
hm9g2ij,AlHorfordHighlights,11/27/2021,1,12362.0,On the other hand Caitlyn already doesnt believe Jinx can be redeemed so its a perfect motivation for her to hunt her down and sets up an interesting conflict with Vi
hm9kipf,SchindlersVirus,11/27/2021,1,33.0,why does this sound like an ad
hma0mt9,MantraDantra,11/27/2021,1,21.0,Because of a TV show
hm9ph4f,Talonoscopy,11/27/2021,1,234.0,Even with full build R does 900-1000 physical damage pre-mitigation and W does like 600. Sure dude.
hmbudoq,Educational-Star-192,11/27/2021,1,3.0,All I see is him letting his adc die and leech off of two kills by pressing R. Nothing about carrying.
hma9cei,streyer,11/27/2021,1,,they just checked opgg theres pictures of his and his wifes opgg that show them playing ARAM together at the same time as FNC were playing on stage.
hm9fvwa,iMidg3t,11/27/2021,1,372.0,This is what I guy commented about it  >have people advocating for the merging of servers actually played games like that before? Dota 2 have different servers too but no region lock so you can play on whatever server you want and as a result both NA and EU are fucking horrifying every other game is 4 peruvians or 4 russians on your team screaming in their own language and communication is basically 0 people think its just gonna be oh I can play with my friend who goes on a different server more are in for a rude awakening if this actually happens.  Similar shit would happen in this case including the drop of quality in ranked since eune players literally dont even try to win rankeds its a fucking coinflip.
hm9w5nq,PursueSomeBitches,11/27/2021,1,22.0,Mute your team. Play Annie until you dont suck
hm9ftol,CuriousPipe8558,11/27/2021,1,11.0,Wish I knew the answer to the first one idk what I want in life anymore genuinely speaking. Never wanted kids I kinda hate dating after a couple bad relationships I’m hard stuck diamond in league don’t think that will change career wise I’m making more money than I’ll ever need. I guess I just need a new realistic goal in life to pursue but I just don’t know anymore it all feels boring and league is all I know after all these years.
hmcl59f,Puzzleheaded-Area863,11/27/2021,1,22.0,vi was capable fighting without gauntlets a shimmer user and only got beaten because she was trying to get information and didnt expect the blade from the robot arm. and sure being a man means you are stronger but having a strong man with no experience with combat training wont really beat someone with actual training. there is also the perk that sett is a vastaya but only half blood and we do not know the extent of his powers so i am not convinced that sett beats vi especially if has her gauntlets. we lack a lot of lore from sett while vi had a whole show dedicated to her
hmbga8m,gjfrthvcghh,11/27/2021,1,,A summoner. It was just an Easter egg of the old league lore
hmcv42w,ketoske,11/27/2021,1,,As a DIG fan yes but also fuck you :c
hmakyf1,Toast72,11/27/2021,1,115.0,theyre a mid laner they just like to talk
hmd0grc,yang763328228,11/27/2021,1,218.0,LoL stop spitting BS. It was bot/sup carried FPX the most of time during spring Nuguri carried a few times but you could barely call him decent. During the summer it was mid/JG saved day. Nuguri was such a trash who got solo killed 11 times in 15 games. He was so bad that fpx had to bench him.
hmatww1,lcecoffee12,11/27/2021,1,185.0,BREAKING: Suddenly everyone is climbing to new ranks in preseason.
hmd5gff,RagoatFS,11/27/2021,1,410.0,Akali Mordekaiser Lillia
hmbx5na,ApplePitou,11/27/2021,1,2.0,Wonderful song and after watching Arcane it made more sense :3
hmdadp8,tremmyguy,11/27/2021,1,2.0,yeah im also above 50% winrate on azir doesnt mean it feels good playing it most of the time ok buddy?  also I might be statistically dumb but how does exactly pulling a winrate on a single champion provide an accurate image on general game state.
hmaj6o8,GiandTew,11/27/2021,1,160.0,he is good but not as good as maiden or daisy

hmagdrt,Rawdream,11/27/2021,1,79.0,Tian is such a great person.
hmczjs6,MapPotential9009,11/27/2021,1,317.0,Its odd they dont being back these seasonal map changes. Whats the issue with them? It would be a real nice change for the game which tbh is needed.
hma1n9f,Seba7290,11/27/2021,1,44.0,Yes. Just like in episode 8 he is able to switch between a melee hammer form and a ranged cannon form. Knowing how to properly manage the forms and when to switch them obviously takes quite a bit of practice.
hm8xp7m,midoBB,11/27/2021,1,18.0,I mean hes the best Ornn and GP player of all time. He can do both.
hmc7rw7,ImAlemira,11/27/2021,1,,now kiss!
hmbnapo,DisastrousZone,11/27/2021,1,588.0,> most memorable release for me  Mainly because I was getting teased irl at an event.
hmd6ezn,Historical-Lack-2666,11/27/2021,1,170.0,And how will they compete in LCS being an independent team? Isnt possible
hmccnye,FerryAssink,11/27/2021,1,235.0,My friend played Sion I played Zilean. We had drake passive Zilean ult Guardian Angel and his own passive. Shit was mad fun they couldnt get rid of him we kept laughing so hard.
hm9jj8y,Dobbeth,11/27/2021,1,52.0,Play tankbusters into him. Trundle Morde Darius
hmb2osm,alemar02,11/27/2021,1,206.0,For ADCs I feel it is always the same back when conqueror was broken and both marksman and bruisers abused it they only nerfed it for ADCs leaving it completely broken for bruisers so they kept abusing it
hm9ww7n,B1aze_,11/27/2021,1,22.0,I had this bug a while back and I thought it was bcs of banshees literally lost me the game bcs I couldnt be on the map as fast as i should be with the passive
hmcbnze,Excalidorito,11/27/2021,1,405.0,> The problem is majority of ADCs cannot be played elsewhere at all.  This goes for most classes though and let’s not forget Lucian having to get a kit update to make him less viable mid and more viable bot. Plus Tristana and Akshan are still viable midlane too and Vayne/Quinn in top.  Anyway back to my original point. You see a few mages played bot and support and a total of... I think 2? In the jungle.  Bruisers only really see play toplane occasionally jungle and (rarely) mid to counter assassins.  Speaking of assassins they only go mid and more recently jungle.   Tanks are probably the most versatile in which role they play maybe tied with mages seeing as how they are played viably in top jgl and supp.  Point is no class is truly amazing at every role. Some are more versatile than others but no class is actually hardlocked into a single role.
hmdblmr,JoshQuest1,11/27/2021,1,,Typically what QRQ is useful for for me is:   Hit 2500ish range e   Q   Walk a little   R   Q    I will admit that it is not nearly as efficient as you can only do about 3 commands while in R so wasting one of them on Q is less than optimal but the QQR being so tight makes it not worth the attempt.   If I was in a sub-10 ping evironment I think Id be more inclined to agree.    Id be curious to see a replay though maybe Im just not fully grasping what you mean.   (Give me a summoner name and I can try to look up a Zoe game.)
hmaexn8,Falsus,11/27/2021,1,66.0,I hope they dont cancel those kinds of event altogether since I love the idea behind it and hoped for something like that for a really long time. And was pretty happy with Spirit Blossom.  Just they gotta do it better than the Ruination event was done.
hm96tdp,Terozu,11/27/2021,1,9.0,Dont use Skin Owned.
hma172o,PlasticForkRubberDuc,11/27/2021,1,53.0,Yeah my jaw actually dropped when I read that. There is a *very* good reason that ADCs are the only class that didnt get any new items this preseason. They have been (in general) in a very good spot for the past year with very strong core and situational itemisation.
hmd9583,SashaNL,11/27/2021,1,7.0,Thanks :3
hmcz2m6,cr_y,11/27/2021,1,30.0,Core really drafted himself the strongest team in this tournament. The house always wins EZ Clap.
hmaj87p,__v1ce,11/27/2021,1,605.0,Xerath
hma4tt0,Matosque,11/27/2021,1,147.0,> plays Aram with his wife  lol really?
hmcscyt,DerpSkeeZy,11/27/2021,1,44.0,Doublelift Svenskeren IgNar Jensen and an import top (maybe roleswap Jiizuke) could be a legitimate team in the LCS  Alternatively it could also be Zven Sven Jensen IgNar and a native toplaner  furthermore Zven could become a resident this year similar to ssumday last year  If EGs development roster goes terribly wrong (and I dont think it will) I wonder if they would consider something like that. Either way buyouts too OP.
hmbp383,TripleTip,11/27/2021,1,172.0,Yeah maybe try fixing the fucking game before throwing out a bunch of changes that no one asked for.
hmd8owe,oddloop_lol,11/27/2021,1,,It was because they were planning to release Popstar ahri and they didnt want to release 2 skins for her.
hmctjjg,seabedurchin,11/27/2021,1,490.0,Ryze could be removed from the lore and the game and it would barely have any impact on either. He sucks.
hmbq740,Zoe_AspectOfCancer,11/27/2021,1,156.0,I think Sylas would fit as the co-main character of Demacia filling Anti-hero role
hmd0e2f,Crivelo,11/27/2021,1,30.0,Honestly I don’t think he did well at all.   I don’t think that matters though. He got a taste of what a world-class toplaner can be. Failure is a part of improvement. I agree that this is great for his career if he can learn from it!
hmayx3d,M1minko,11/27/2021,1,530.0,remember when draktharr released? i thought it was two seasons ago...
hmckfob,SomeToxicRivenMain,11/27/2021,1,440.0,It’s definitely shaco because we can all relate to him. We’re all clowns that most people hate seeing
hmajn8f,goblin0100,11/27/2021,1,6.0,So? Its an event cos she is a Korean champ
hmafpcy,firehydrant_man,11/27/2021,1,,she literally still needs to hit 6 autos to use it

hmb0190,SleepyLabrador,11/27/2021,1,7.0,> Make counter-picking less decisive   That would be very hard to do but all the top laners would agree with you. EVERY top laner has 3+ hard counters that make the game unplayable for you. Ill give some examples.  * I first pick a bruiser (Jax) The enemy team can pick Kennen Malphite or Poppy against me and I wont have fun.  * I first pick a tank(Malphite) The enemy team can pick Sylas Illaoi or Vladimir against me and I wont have fun.  * I first pick a juggernaut (Morde) The enemy team can pick Fiora Vayne or Trynd against me and I wont have fun.

hmd5z3b,heypenda,11/27/2021,1,33.0,thank you :)
hm9zi97,Mostdakka,11/27/2021,1,25.0,Its not like we are the ones who brought it back. If things were resolved properly we wouldnt be here in the first place. Yes is none of our buisness to what really happenned but it doesnt mean we cant criticize the way this matter has been handled by all parties involved.
hm93p0c,lKyou,11/27/2021,1,3973.0,Idk maybe they shouldnt be been that forgiving maybe they decided that with rekkles going into ERL and Hans to NA upset might be the best ADC in lec yet and they didnt want to lose him. Maybe they are some more shady stuff we dont know about lmao. But yeah Ill give you that.  Still Adam got his shot at world taken away from him and considering they are tossing him away like trash afterwards might be his only one.. Upset didnt trust Adam with private matter(rightfully I agree) but Adam doesnt have to trust him on his good reason either. So yeah his frustration and anger are totally understandable. Is him twittlongering about it fine? Hell no but unfortunately it seems its how things are done in eSports..
hmbzrv7,SaulJoker,11/27/2021,1,12.0,I would argue the Vi and Jayce fight is up there too.  I would also like to say that the scene where Heimerdinger gets the boot from the council is my personal favorite. There’s just something about how they captured Heimerdinger’s feelings with just his expressions that made me feel like “yeah this is it.”
hmcpnzl,PhantomRager,11/27/2021,1,228.0,Morde Garen Jax. Doubt it that anyone will guess it
hm9o4gm,HarpertFredje,11/27/2021,1,28.0,They are really strong. Its high risk/high reward.
hmab1ki,Numerous-Yak8130,11/27/2021,1,408.0,Pants look a little loose on you but the color overall is spot on. It actually looks kind of paint brush style like the show. Great job.
hm9kjn7,Completerandosorry,11/27/2021,1,35.0,No I shouldn’t. I enjoy this game and my frustration with it is minimal.
hm8zyjc,SaltyPyrate,11/27/2021,1,3.0,It looks like it took the splash of God King Darius for the Morde picture.

hmd698l,wazzup3,11/27/2021,1,,Hmmm fair points all around although i can see your points i am too stubborn to relent so i will say petricite armor would work fairly well against mages even if they arent fully covered in petricite a simple chestplate/emblem maybe on the chest would work wonders then the mage would have to actually think about what they were doing  instead of a little girl who doesnt know how her magic works being able to incinerate an entire squad of soldiers and if petricite is an expensive material i can point to the actual castle of demacia  being made mostly of petricite further still it would nullify most of sylas army and chemical castration doesnt usually end up torturing/killing people who were just minding there business really the root of demacias problem seems to be ill preparation
hm9ynrt,Pazbang,11/27/2021,1,4460.0,Have you ever played a team sport? Because if you had you clearly know that a team is much much more then “co-workers”
hmb9ihw,clashbabyyy,11/27/2021,1,125.0,Or a damage reduction which would also impact lifesteal
hmaoxc1,SylerTheSK,11/27/2021,1,76.0,Pyke and MF are done so impossibly bad in the sentinels event that there is no way its canon.  I know that a rioter said the overall story is real just not any of the interactions. So Im head-canoning that the only real parts are Viego rising again Viego getting imprisoned again and Thresh taking over. No one outside of Ruined King is involved and anything else that comes out concerning this is just fanfic to me.

hmcz2ud,Destinum,11/27/2021,1,94.0,Cosmic Reaver Kassadin is actually the skin that was specifically created to celebrate the OCE server since they wanted to do a theme thats representative of OCE as a whole and not just Australia. The theme in question is the Crux/Southern Cross star constellation.

hmc2dwc,10inchblackhawk,11/27/2021,1,214.0,Statistically it is the best drake.  https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/rankings/drakes  Others are an 86% winrate while this is 91% winrate. It wins 50% more games than the others. Definitely earned a nerf.
hmbrm90,ApplePitou,11/27/2021,1,53.0,Reddit is not my life and no one needs to worry about me because I dont complain about my life and prefer rain from the sun :3
hmcxsuo,Frozen_Watcher,11/27/2021,1,,Kinda surprising Riot rolled back this dumb westernising of their female Ionian rolsters in recent skins in favour of more conventional Asian features considering Ive seen complaints from mainland Asians about how they made those characters look uglier.

hmd4o8h,belithioben,11/27/2021,1,37.0,Rule of thumb is you have to R just before the star passes by Zoe. If you spam Q1 Q2 its pretty much immediately but if you walk forward between the Qs you can wait a bit before pressing R.
hmbaeq5,native_usurper,11/27/2021,1,549.0,Season two baby!

hmd6jwj,Ciridae79,11/27/2021,1,637.0,Salt water pools are actually dope. No chlorine to worry about with you eyes/ color treated hair.
hmaflcw,Caenen_,11/27/2021,1,138.0,Eve becomes untargetable before dealing damage but remains untargetable well after the damage is dealt. This prevents turret aggro...or so I thought.  Upon actually conducting a few tests on this its slightly more complex than that. Fizz also gains turret aggro if his E ends *very soon* after dealing damage to a champion (e.g. with R) even if he was untargetable at the time the damage was dealt. He will not gain aggro if he does not become targetable for longer than a fraction of a second after dealing damage.  Ill pay a visit to the notes I have on turret behaviour (turrets have more delays to their action than just attack windup) and with that might be able to explain it as a bug. Or its intentionally cased to not allow Eve to switch aggro in a dive without blinking out of turret range - which I dont think it is.
hmck2t6,PMMeRule34Pls,11/27/2021,1,23.0,To note as well Ive spent alot of RP on other things and some of my skin purchases were pre hextech crafting/bundles/chests. If you went only bundles I think it would costs maybe 3-4k.
hmcqx6s,HairyTurtle12345,11/27/2021,1,116.0,It is 100% gonna be removed no way it stays in the game lol its like spear of shojin just not gonna last
hm8x7mt,RedDotClips,11/27/2021,1,4.0,Just refund a champ under account in the marketplace. You get 3 refunds.
hmd9gt5,Arcadia47,11/27/2021,1,170.0,The issue is its the long standing pros like Rekless Sven Jensen DL etc getting phased out. These are the players who have been playing for years who have created a large fan base and who are name branded. Instead they are getting replaced by cheaper LCK/LPL players. I can promise you viewership in the west will decrease next season.  Youre either TL who can afford the super team roster or be a TSM/C9 who are importing these cheaper smaller foreign players. Thats the direction the league is heading in.
hmc63t7,UNOvven,11/27/2021,1,91.0,No no he is actually right. 2 more lethality is not insignificant. And the anti-shield property of it does matter in quite a few matchups. And keep in mind despite that *Serpants Fang is not good*. Meanwhile ability haste? Not nearly as significant. Even on Pyke you dont see them go into every source of CDR. Prowlers is better than Duskblade. They go for Resolve and not Sorcery and even if they go for Sorcery they skip the CDR rune and go for movement speed instead.  And thats before we get into gold threshold. Axiom Arc costs as much as Youmuus while its performance is lower than that of Serpents Fang which costs a full *400* gold less. Its genuinely just not a good item on Pyke. Or anyone really. Its probably sharing the spot of the worst lethality item with umbral glaive and serpents fang.
hmd0994,ShadyGecko,11/27/2021,1,30.0,His comms didnt sound like he was egoing either at least from what I heard so theres still good hope for him.
hm9mkh3,1UnoriginalName,11/27/2021,1,178.0,So if your org had a real chance to get Faker and asked you if hes good and if they should try to get him you would just say no because it would backstab your rookie mid?  Players get replaced for better players in any sport constantly. Considering it wasnt Upset activly reaching out on his own but just giving his opinion to the org their really isnt a problem.

hm9341y,DmonAbsoluTrEbON,11/27/2021,1,33.0,Mehhh they never win the Kappa Cup anyways. T1 might be worlds contender everytime they play internationally but it seems that they dont have luck in this tournament. I can see them going hard for it in Fakers last year but considering he still got like 2\~3 years left... Ehhh not so much tbh. EzSkip

hmc1qrg,Leagueofl12,11/27/2021,1,214.0,There are many factors at play like what if you have less pressure or team is behind there is no contesting or teamfighting because its just not worth dying for
hma84un,Conker184,11/27/2021,1,145.0,From what I gather it has to be something with his wife and Upset doesnt wanna somehow imply she is to blame.  It does seem kinda odd that he is so unwilling to given even the slightest amount of amplifying information.

hmbicvi,Sonder332,11/27/2021,1,19.0,Okay so I guess since Ahri is coded for Korean server rep and someone in the comments said Sera is coded for Chinese server rep hence why she got the phoenix skin. Does NA or EU have one?
hmcqe2d,gkrown,11/27/2021,1,43.0,ya. i mean take money out of it of course. just talent wise.
hm9dc28,t44g,11/27/2021,1,172.0,Trying to reason with Reddit simps is like watching the paint dry... These people are under 20 or in their early twenties save your breath. Now go ahead and down vote me to oblivion. Go into the real world and try pulling off what Upset did at your company and try coming back the next day - I wont spoil the outcome for you but if certainly wouldnt end up well!   When youll be in your 30s youll realize that Upset fucked up his entire team who worked hard for an entire year and they have every reason to be pissed at what he pulled off! Put yourself in Adams shoes Im surprised he went off so lax on him.   TLDR Upset fucked up his entire team and left them hanging and he cannot even disclose the reason to his teammates who worked extremely hard the entire season. Stop being SIMPS its obviously related to his gf.

hma2ojn,hpl2000,11/27/2021,1,,I mean I guess. It just sounds harsh to assume that everyone is playing the game “wrong” just because they aren’t in the top 0.01% of the playerbase. There’s no wrong way to play a video game as long as you enjoy yourself.

hmaffv9,SP3EDI,11/27/2021,1,,Dude then its Adams own stupidity when he still doesnt know what happend. There was even a fucking press release about what he needed to know.

hmaaw0t,XiaoRCT,11/27/2021,1,313.0,Its not about the privacy of someone else because it isnt about what happened its about how his teammates felt about him leaving.  People are acting as if this was an impossible situation when its obvious that there was an issue with communication between Upset and the team when it comes to actually clarifying to them what happened.   I seriously doubt that there was nothing in between what they were actually communicated and telling them the whole truth and exposing his wife like a lot of people are making it out to be.
hmbfuqu,420SanKa,11/27/2021,1,88.0,Not the main character he doesnt even want to be a hero..  however his action gave him the choice to become the next Thanos if somehow he turn  evil
hmantmz,fnlbss,11/27/2021,1,12404.0,The other chem barons in the lore are old as shit and much more of a threat than silco was him only having two facilities so if arcanes just truly retconning them all away that means Zac and Mundo are also going to be retconned quite heavily.  Not to mention Warwick lost pretty much his whole Plot. The dog literally exists to kill the chem barons. If those guys around the table were the chem barons hes going to complete his story pretty quickly.  I edited the original post cause this is getting annoying.

hmd0qf2,ShadyGecko,11/27/2021,1,,He got series MVP so I dont think its so bad to spread the love a bit game to game. Like game 2 I get that he was a meat shield but did he make more big plays compared to Dark Wings? Dark had way higher KP.
hmd8i1p,Zorrodx,11/27/2021,1,535.0,Fizz is your most played who is pretty bad but good in solo queue I guess rengar too and irelia there’s no way you are good at your irelia. If you are playing champs like Fizz and Rengar that signals to me you have a very solo queue ish mentality and aren’t that skilled mechanically. Or you just picked up playing irelia. Hmmmmmmmm. 2 mid laners and a jungler. Irelia and rengar can also be played top. That’s also kinda sus. I’m guessing you aren’t great at any one thing so I’m gonna guess gold

hmc2czz,JustKeepMoving22,11/27/2021,1,15.0,Bruh that’s actually so nice. Imagine being the  artist and having the CREATOR have your art as their phone Lock Screen for that long
hmaor6t,Accountforcontrovers,11/27/2021,1,7.0,Well yeah but so is Lissadra
hmbq7jz,Zyralan,11/27/2021,1,70.0,I see him once every 5-7 games pretty much. More than most other supports. I can deal with him but his Ult just singlehandedly turns a winning teamfight into an ace for the enemy team.
hmbukpd,leaguethrowaway1996,11/27/2021,1,29.0,This isn’t bad but the ultimate isn’t a good idea from a gameplay perspective nor could I imagine it being fun for anyone. Riot tries to avoid taking control away from a player hence why there aren’t effects like a blind on any of Lux abilities — it’s anti fun to have your screen all while and unplayable. Plus it’s not fun or interactive for an AI to take control of another champion as your ultimate ability for the same reason that Mordekaiser’s old dragon AI ultimate was underwhelming.   Taking control of someone’s champion for 6 to 10 seconds basically means you’re ruining that person’s ability to play the game. This would be the new most hated champion in the game by far.  I’d be curious to see what you could come up with for an alternate direction with the ultimate. Maybe something based around empowering either himself or his allies with shimmer akin to a Mundo ult? I think it could be cool for his ultimate to be a transform similar to Gnar in that you have a different move set and better base stats but it’s gated around the ability cooldown instead of a fury meter? That seems like it would be consistent with the story surrounding shimmer and how people effected by it are depicted in the show.

hmd6gq1,D3ZURAH,11/27/2021,1,,right? like they got a massive bomb coming straight at them right before the scene and season ends. 🙄 yet we all know at least Jayce and Victor lives somehow. could have at least actually showed us the explosion for the finale? really nothing that cool even happened for the ending

I actually love this down time in fact as I can actually enjoy myself now that League is off atm (not for long though cuz Demacia Cup is starting soon)
hmagx8p,SaulJoker,11/27/2021,1,26.0,Emotional abuse? That’s called being a coach man. You see this in every sport. Coaches need to motivate their players and if what it takes is a passionate rant about how they can play better then that’s what the coach will do.  He literally berated Flandre for 20 minutes straight in front of the entire team when he would rage quit scrims. He never did it again. Surprise surprise.

hmd716h,transformers03,11/27/2021,1,45.0,As someone who got obsessed with Arcane and tried to look up who else is famous in LoL Ezreal came up a lot and I thought he did look like a generic main character.

hmc9htw,PlebTier9,11/27/2021,1,346.0,Thats what they were going for. In his lore his parents go missing on an exploration and he becomes an explorer believing that his parents will have to come back if they hear stories of the great explorer Ezreal. Hes literally a lonely boy in denial about his missing/dead parents.

hmakzx5,CreativeAd481,11/27/2021,1,23.0,Aatroxs revive was removed because he was in a situation where he was extremely powerful in pro play but was weak in solo queue. It was part of an attempt to make him more equitable across different skill levels. It has nothing to do with the Chemtech Soul.
hmab3a4,DaveidT,11/27/2021,1,313.0,Upset has said that he has shared with the entire team many times how hard of a time he was going through with issues at home. No he didn’t tell the entire team what was exactly happening but he DID share with them that he has been struggling. He also shared with key members of his team what the entire issue was.  If the people on the team had legitimate questions and concerns about him leaving they could have asked Yamato/Hyli. Their either didn’t or they did and they didn’t trust Yamato/Hyli AND didn’t trust Upset. Either way the way Adam handled his frustration was so bad. He just put things out to the public without concern of it’s repercussions.

hmadqgj,falkner97,11/27/2021,1,310.0,Firstly dont drop the bullshit and compare his family to his friends on a completely different matter   his family problem makes him leave   his family problem do not affect him telling his teammates   his teammates is not stopping him from leaving   wrong comparison   Secondly so he feel it is right to get the OK from the higher up and doesnt feel that its needed to get his teammate to know what happen   wheres the basic respect for these people?   you think 1 whole year of effort that they put into getting to worlds dont deserve that basic respect of knowing what happen?

The thing about Faker is that hes so legendary and versatile that hes known for multiple champions (Zed Leb Ryze Syndra Riven Azir Ahri and probably more that I cant think of right now). If I had to choose which champions represented him I would probably go:  Early Faker (S3-S4): Zed  Fakers Prime (S5-S7): Ryze  Modern Faker (S8-now): Azir

hmccclk,ColdVictories,11/27/2021,1,3.0,Agreed. I was permabanned by such a problem. I hardly responded to my toxic team never cursed at them never blew up and because of how Riot evaluated it (they only see your chat not the rest of it) i was the one declared toxic. Report xxxx was literally against the rules and no one ever gets punished for it.   Ive appealed a couple times now and its Looks like the punishment was correctly placed and Im just floored by how simply they dont care about it.
hmd8t3k,SpiderTechnitian,11/27/2021,1,133.0,Ya thats my point  People upvoted the above thing but Im trying to show lack of consistency so the reasoning above doesnt really follow

hm9jaux,Caenen_,11/27/2021,1,81.0,1. New issue with stealth indicators. To be actually seen the turrets true sight bubble needs LOS on you so the indicator is not actually correct even.  2. Related to the same thing. Stealth stuff got a bunch of weird changes this patch which Ill get to in detail a little later.  3. *Probably* also related to the stealth adjustments. Sudden impacts interaction with stealth might have been broken as a whole. Gonna investigate.  4. Not sure on this one will have to look into it first.  5. New with the stealth changes in 11.23 aswell happens to all camo champions. Seems to have more trigger conditions than just being out of cull range too.  6. I remember when this was introduced. The correct behaviour is for the W icon to be greyed out until the mark times out or is triggered then the cooldown starts. [Heres some more context on a post from a few months ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/oc6mpd/evelynn_w_cooldown_bug/) The bug was introduced at some time in the first half of Season 11.  Paging u/Riot_Koyuncu to see the extra context for the 6th bug.
hm9nn5x,Voller_Faulheit,11/27/2021,1,94.0,Yeah exactly that would be great tower dives are waaaay too easy right now.  Outside of that giving towers increasing rate of fire and true damage would help a lot. Actually make them a threat.

If CC and peel were that much of an issue for them they wouldnt have appeared at Worlds given how much CC and peel Worlds team draft.

hm9q2f4,CCrimson93X,11/27/2021,1,8.0,Well I did say in my experience not yours.  1. Im not though Annies Q is a skill shot in wildrift and she is doing just fine there. Im not asking any champion to be deleted. Im asking for skill shots on everyone to make it more balanced. I really cannot see your point here. 2. Bot leveled accounts? Thats still a thing? Ive never fought a bot in the main summoners rift map ever. Are they common or something? Id like to hear more on this. But the point is it would increase skill level even overall which means both sides will make less stupid plays = less frustration within the games and hopefully a less toxic community too.  3. I feel as if it would be worth to implement into the game. Help with learning to freeze lanes jungle routes etc.  4. Well I never said the system would be perfect but at the same time from where Im standing it would help in the longer run not to mention a fair majority of players already have level 4 on 20+ champs anyways so. Normals are used for casual games and practice outside of ranked so I generally fail to see where the terrible idea comes from. 5. True but at the same time it would also help players see a in game skin compared to said splash art. Dota 2 Smite etc. have all got their skins & cosmetics on show for the person to see League could do that instead if needed.   6. Honestly I dont see it as useless as its only a small tip and its optional

hmcq7jj,DestroyerofSoul,11/27/2021,1,67.0,A lot of the problem is Mpen items are too gold efficient so its becomes a nobrainer to build them.  It just becomes your default path just think about how strong sorcerer shoes are.   Youre negating about half the enemy MR with a 1100g item and it gives almost the complete value of Shadowflame in terms of Mpen with no strings attached like Shadow or Luden has(Locked behind Item commitment/Tied to enemy HP and shielding for max value).  Without sorcerer shoes in the game resistances probably matter again similar to tabis vs AD champions(Soon as any bruiser gets tabis Auto focused champs eat dirt till LDR or 3 item) but theres no alternative for anti mage shoes cept subpar tenacity shoes.  Its why riot wont bring Armpen shoes because youd just have assassins just crazy broken but still not as broken as a mage because everyones MR scaling sucks(Even melees) in this game compared to Armor.
hmd264o,WTF_Scuba,11/27/2021,1,127.0,When you focus on bringing up new talent the past-their-prime veterans will often be on the outside looking in.

Instead of doing a handful of these smaller map reskins every year we’ve instead been focusing our efforts on creating more immersive environments that players get to experience for a longer period of time.  lacks depth? its not supposed to have depth in any way its just a holiday event also they are focusing on creating more immersive environments?.   Where are they? its been a year nothing has come out of this. nexus blitz is not even a permanent game mode? it seems like they needed an excuse to axe the snowdown rift because Riot doesnt like fun anymore they are serious about Esports dont you know?.

On top of that he’s taken a year off from pro play so he hasn’t been playing at LCS level. No scrims or synergy with anyone over the past year.

hma4b15,SovereignType,11/27/2021,1,9.0,Sett does everything Vi does but better... straight up replacement. I rarely see people play her because Sett exists.
hmcgd4z,LeatherBodybuilder,11/27/2021,1,286.0,China Korea and Vietnam all celebrate Lunar New Years. You know 3 out of 4 biggest servers in the game.  You do realize that the holiday events are for LoL players and not everyone who exists on the planet right?   Significantly more LoL players care about Lunar New Years than Christmas. The player population of China Korea and Vietnam is more than 10x the number of NA EU TR BR etc. combined. Even in NA 1/4 or more of the NA playerbase probably celebrates Lunar New Years too due to how many Asian-Americans/Canadians play League.
hmc29oa,helldog2269,11/27/2021,1,3.0,are you sure? there was a whole new event a week later the undercity nights event?
hmbanbb,MinimumPotential21,11/27/2021,1,264.0,Half.  Half is the word youre looking for.
hmd59su,NoFlayNoPlay,11/27/2021,1,29.0,tanks being broken isnt the reason you die every 3 minutes on caitlyn.  the reason tanks dont just tank is because if they cant even kill an adc in over 7 seconds without being peeled you can literally ignore them.  if the slingshot doesnt spell your death unless you dodge it zac would be a useless champion. its honestly that simple.
hmcw7rt,noblemile,11/27/2021,1,529.0,Spelt Lux wrong :V

Youre also just responding to points you have a cohesive argument against so far. Any point that has contested your point or you would most likely have a subpar response to has not been adressed.

hmcext8,Jesse1205,11/27/2021,1,235.0,I DESPISE the chemtech map. Its just obnoxious. Having to constantly keep it pinked is a pain. Plus I dunno if something is off with my settings but whenever the map transitions into chemtech it is SO loud.

hmaz455,SSMBBlueWisp,11/27/2021,1,81.0,Theres one thing from the game that really boggles my mind and its something that theres no answer. Ending spoilers.  >!How the fuck does Viego escape from the necklace after Ruined King but before Sentinels of Light. Per the official timeline released by Riot Forge the game takes place a year before Sentinels of Light yet Illaoi keeps the necklace with Viego inside. How the hell will they explain that?!<

hmcpyg4,Rengar_Is_Good_kitty,11/27/2021,1,490.0,All the jokes aside in the comments yeah hes pretty much always been the face of LoL but Riot has slowly turned away from that making him more of a lesser character.  Thing is Ryze just doesnt sell nothing more to it really sad to see what was once basically the lead character of LoL relegated to... well nothing now really.

hmcyt4g,Excludee,11/27/2021,1,4.0,Everything about the Chem dragon is infuriating.   The chemtech zones are extremely dangerous to play around unless youre the first one to them   the effect is either crazy strong or not really noticeable   the soul is not only outrageously over the top its also kind of confusing to play around since killing a target no longer takes them out of the game  And to top it all of the dragon is ugly as hell. I mean really look at it. Its like someone put silly putty into a lizard-shaped mold and then threw it in a microwave.

hma5ygo,RevolutionaryBricks,11/27/2021,1,55.0,Well sniper’s gonna have a rough time then- there was a point this season where his brother couldn’t get a visa so we know it’s about 80 ping to the inhouses from where they live. I’d imagine the rest of the players are all in LA though so it’ll probably be run there
hmbmz4o,Love--Yours,11/27/2021,1,4.0,Nobody gives a single fuck about ranked flex wanna know why? Because solo/duo was the only thing back then with a 5v5 team builder mode. Flex was just a sorry excuse for it. I treat flex like draft. It is much easier in flex to hit a high rank. Flex is nothing and that’s the sad truth.
hmcpmdn,Jiaozy,11/27/2021,1,67.0,Yeah sure your 2 items ADC with Kraken Slayer or Shieldbow is worse off than a tank?  What game are you playing where LDR + Mythic is worse than Bami item + Thornmail/Spirit Visage?
hmbvlmm,jubilee414404,11/27/2021,1,382.0,Its funny because I feel like a parent in the midlane when my baby boy goes after his shiny new toy (scuttle crab) and loses the game from it haha.  I guess its just a matter of perspective

hm9g2sc,Lovec852,11/27/2021,1,17.0,You might want to leave PVP-based games. Just because of their nature they bring the worst out of people.   I cycle trough games and i am always pleasantly surprised how communities in online games are so much nicer. No mans Sky Guild Wars 2 Runescape WoW... the difference from LoL & CSGO is huge. Btw huge difference doesnt mean trolls arent any in MMOs they still are just in really low numbers and in PVP modes.  Also single player games are awesome you can spend years playing 4X games. Without people.

hmc7k21,JohnCornewaille,11/27/2021,1,91.0,While the execution was horrible for SoL Miss Fortune actually letting Viego take a hold of her makes a lot of sense if you consider one of the main points of her story in RK is that more and more she is losing herself for her vengeance against Gangplank no matter the costs. What she needs for it to be believable is good writing not the SoL writing.

hmbp9uu,Serene_Skies,11/27/2021,1,107.0,Well they also said that Kayles visual change was because armor wouldnt make sense on a champion that is supposed to be squishy but then released Gwen who has one of the highest base armors in the game and is wearing a frilly dress.
hmaz2lw,0x43686F70696E,11/27/2021,1,2.0,Yep other people in champ select were saying the same thing
hm95ras,venomstrike31,11/27/2021,1,38.0,But even this link calls juggernauts a subclass of fighter. Both juggernauts and divers are fighters (bruisers) I think its weird to imply that champs like Illaoi Yorick and Sett arent bruisers.

hmdb8h4,calvinee,11/27/2021,1,111.0,Man this isn’t true at all stop rewriting history. Impact can play tanks and bruisers to a great level he’s just not a carry player. Aatrox is one of his best picks.   He’s just not someone who’s going to smash lane by himself nor is he that great on carry champs like Jayce/Irelia/Fiora etc. His GP was always more of a weakside GP than someone you funnel resources into.
hmadvct,TheBestCCIsDeath,11/27/2021,1,191.0,If anything it shows youre biased because you got used to the garbage and dont want it to change. Well guess what the game needs to evolve the trash needs to go. Singed will not last long.

Problem is hes pretty rare to see and when you do its usually the one trick players that use him so they know everything about him and play him very well. I came to the conclusion hes not worth the ban for the 10% chance I see him. My go to ban every game is Shaco.

hmbpqlu,Nivelyx,11/27/2021,1,12.0,I wish you wouldnt defend champion bounties Paul it would be so easier if we all just agreed that bounties are bad in general this isnt Mario kart.  With that said i think objective bounties are healtheir than champion bounties because it allows for more scaling and i like mages haha... No but the thing that i like about objective bounties is that it decreases the importance of laning. You can make good plays on the map later in the game and secure some objective bounties.
hma5ind,digdeepman,11/27/2021,1,6.0,Dude league is not a straightforward game.. some champs need synergy .. some dont.. kog is amazing with the right supports.. this is why lol is fun .. to explore and discover awesome shit
hmb6q1s,roadnot_taken,11/27/2021,1,264.0,Jinx Vayne and Twitch are all likely on the nerf list when Riot comes back from vacation the gold in the system has made them scale WAY too fast. LT just sends them over the mark.

hma7j11,Ringo_A,11/27/2021,1,145.0,Literally everybody that actually knows actually said they cant say what it was but it was actually that bad and they agree with his decision. Even people that usually hate on FNC like Rich agreed that they did everything right here. No idea if youre 15 or something but everybody has their own ways to cope with pain and stress and sometimes even if somebody was in hospital for example he cant be there 24/7. So saying his pain cant be bad because he relaxes with a few arams with his wife just shows that you have no idea what life can throw at you sometimes.
hma5nyc,motivatedtuna,11/27/2021,1,2.0,Raging at them doesn’t help them. If they’re doing it on purpose is one thing if they’re dying because they’re getting out matched probably be supportive and maybe they’ll slow down? Idk man

hmae4r0,TheMightyBaloon,11/27/2021,1,18.0,Role is fine the issue with adc is that the lane requires the 2 people to be on the same wavelength.  Not to mention support can literally leave your lane and screw you because they have automatic gold generation and will be useful even if they are down 2 to 3 levels because how the role functions. They could also auto push your lane when it doesnt need to be pushed forcing you into positions where you have to overextend.  Which is what makes adc a horrible role to play because you are at the mercy of your support and you as an adc dont matter given how soloq fights go. You will be left alone in teamfights and will be the target of divers.  So you are forced to develop mechanical skill to compensate for everything else. Which is why high elo adc generally are have good micro and are good mechanically.
hmbml22,cadaada,11/27/2021,1,156.0,yeah riot threw him aside we recently got lucian/senna and the arcane gang. Lets see where he will go now...
hmb8q3f,matteya,11/27/2021,1,452.0,It only happens if the connection streamlines your connection directly to game servers and for that to happen you need to be lucky and most likely test many different connection whatever the service provider is. I don’t think its consistent enough to say it is a legit way to lower your ping. Though there were some services which were also a VPN in a way that were meant for lowering your ping i dont know if theyre still up.

hmafimh,Tilterino247,11/27/2021,1,215.0,Oh. So you just ignored that your original comment was dumb and that you completely misunderstood what you replied to?   Doublelift will win you LCS and take you to worlds. But he did bad at worlds!!   1. That doesnt have anything to do with what I said.  2. So did bjerg and its not looking to be a problem for him.   If you dont like him thats fine a lot of people do t for some reason.  But youre full on blind deaf and dumb if you cant see that hes the best player to ever play in NA so far. If he is playing in LCS hes in the finals. If hes in the finals he wins.   If a team not named 100t tl or tsm (tsm only there cause of ab urged Bridge their adc is not comparable to lift) wanted to win theyd have lift on their team.
hmbctz4,toxicityisamyth,11/27/2021,1,38.0,From ur first sentence it sounds like you aint even watch the scene. Maybe you should do that before replying.  2nd i am not talking about football or basketball or american football coaches abd players im talking about league of legends coaches and players. Huge distinction. I would most definitely not consider behaviour patterns from both sports and lolesports worlds the same. ^^
hmb3md1,ChiefBoss99,11/27/2021,1,147.0,It’s FPX fault for not scouting properly. If this behavior was so well known then they should have known it might be an issue. Clearly they were gambling that they could overcome it and they almost did. But it is completely on FPX if it goes wrong.
hm92d8k,EggmanPandora,11/27/2021,1,145.0,man im very sad for LEC...
hm92bzi,Syfix,11/27/2021,1,11.0,Dont be that guy who gets upset over who kills who. It lowers morale for literally no reason when a kill should boost morale and makes it unfun. Supports can do a lot with gold too if theyre good and are play makers.

hma4d5e,hiccup333,11/27/2021,1,12388.0,Yeah I really feel like you risk losing the viewers trust when you pull stuff like this.  Like they invested their viewership in your show for a full season and you dont deliver satisfying resolution
hmb1obx,Cosmic-Warper,11/27/2021,1,,old LT was pretty good on jinx
hmcz6s5,Yetti2Quick,11/27/2021,1,391.0,not at all true for his case. he coinflips wins all the time not because of his deserved rank because hes playing new role and new champs. But yes i was never comparing him to being stuck in gold. my original post was pointing out that hes playing a new role and new champs so he obviously wont carry games initially like you have to do a lot of the times in that elo. And if you cant carry you are the one getting carried most of the time.

hmbanyd,RedZoomTV,11/27/2021,1,4.0,This is especially needed as I almost just lost a game due to this -      I was dead I had 2 teammates alive while the enemy team only had 1 zed. My jax was going to the nexus which was completely open while MF for whatever reason pinged the hextech dragon for jax to help her.     What ended up happening is Jax almost killed zed but zed lived and MF solod dragon instead of following jax. The whole time MF was Pinging dragon I was trying to spam ping the nexus and MF to end the game as the enemy team only had 1 person alive and it wouldve been free.     I only use pings to communicate as in all my years of playing league since season 2 Ive been talking in chat non stop mostly useless things and gotten many of my accounts perma banned because of it. Therefore I decided to disable my chat completely not even being able to open it so that I would prevent further bans and actually focus on the game. That worked as I got my first honor check point in pretty much ever and Ive gotten a higher rank

hm9ic1z,Prestonwww,11/27/2021,1,32.0,I can definitely understand where youre coming from being loyal to a series. I was born in 02 so I was a little late for the originals of almost every game. But Im an avid pokemon fan and man did I play the shit out of my heartgold and soulsilver copies. I loved those games like they were my children. From that point on Ive loved pokemon ever since but with the recent release of brilliant diamond and shining pearl Im pretty unimpressed. I will not spend that much money for a chibi remake. No thank you. And legends arceus looks pretty cool just not quite my style for a pokemon game. Im glad that they are trying new things I just prefer the whole gym battles and elite four things personally.
hmbepc8,_ziyou_,11/27/2021,1,303.0,The fix would be so easy (i.e. reduce %AS for melee) but I suppose Riot wants to see how it plays out for a bit longer.

hmbkmsf,TheBestCCIsDeath,11/27/2021,1,171.0,Im not sure because on one hand yeah people getting back after killed is annoying but o the other were talking about a team whose soul didnt affect the combat itself before their deaths so their advantage simply comes after dying instead of before.

hmc5imb,TannerThanUsual,11/27/2021,1,285.0,I feel like there is no main character of League it just depends on the story you want to tell. I see why Ryze might feel like the main character in some aspects but Id also argue his importance to the lore doesnt necessarily make him a protagonist.

hmc6t5e,JohnCornewaille,11/27/2021,1,345.0,I dont think it will be a missed opportunity for long. While I love Fortiches animation and I am looking forward for more they can only produce a certain quantity of content while maintaining quality.   Runeterra has many stories that can be adapted by other studios and other kinds of medias (as they have been doing with Comics and Forge). As long as Riot has a very good team coordinating and checking on them and avoiding another SoL type of failure we should have a lot to explore in the future.

hmaso4t,Kroxxen1,11/27/2021,1,8.0,You are comparing a early/mid game vs a champion that’s been notorious for having shit matchups. When you play TF you don’t play to hard win lane you play to win the map. Jayce VS TF match is like a 1% difference in WR lol

hm9sa4b,bupropiom,11/27/2021,1,4.0,So grasp has a lot of things that Skarner loves damage a heal and scaling health. At this point in time unless I make a truly tragic mistake I often dont struggle csing in the early game and Im looking to stack my manaflow band with my E and being able to take short trades where I hit someone with E get the on hit damage of my E and grasp auto to stun and run away makes trades very favorable.

hmcguef,calvinee,11/27/2021,1,102.0,Thats because her bonus AD and range from her ult is tied to her ult duration and her active R2 you can use any time during the ult duration.
hmargm1,ozykingofkings11,11/27/2021,1,298.0,I love this answer because that’s how I think of it as an ADC I have 3 champs of those same different play styles (Kaisa Ashe Tristana). Out of curiosity how would you categorize the play styles of other roles? So I can select a small champion pool for them and branch out.

hmaj7l4,Overmaan,11/27/2021,1,79.0,Tian seems to be a very decent guy. Almost every player who has played with him does nothing but praise him. Even though Tian should have had some difficulties especially this year.  Hope Tian to be healthier and show outplays as he used to do.
hmbz8wa,Xey2510,11/27/2021,1,,They can actually teamfight have a ton of waceclear and work even when there is constant fighting.   Nidalee has no waveclear and bad teamfighting. She is really comp reliant and absolutely terrible against tanks the only thing she is good at is standing far behind and pressuring with spears.

This is the first time ever I heard your name but I think I’ll start keeping an eye for you and learn from experience since I tried to hit at least diamond on all roles yet I keep getting hardstuck in plat to the point where I can’t even reach dia on my main role anymore I think mentality plays big part here. Any words of advice you offer? To summarize my play style im pretty much a jack of all trades but master of none.
hmcnyk7,Gol_D_Haze,11/27/2021,1,9.0,The reason is this: people on this sub bitch about loads of things that are just plain counterable and outplayable.  Ive seen so many post about people complaining about stuff thats litteraly is fine.   The game has a lot of issues but its mostly ITEMS that create these issues!!!  And also people are fkn salty af. This vid got 90k downvotes cos its a meme and the said the forbidden words .  People get bullied by a yasuo or yone and its  uh they are so op but play them yourselfe and they probably feed. If U actually look at the stats its amazing that of the 170ish champs about 150 are completely viable. Winrates dont lie. Im not saying the game is perfect ( by no means) but 80% of the people that complain about X issue are actually way to bad at the game to accurately assess the truth.
hmcv9oe,TPRetro,11/27/2021,1,529.0,chun-li is definitely not as mainstream. Few people people not into video games would know who she is. Mario and Sonic you could ask anyone off the street and theyd know. Not sure about Johnny Cage.

hm8ysso,fartdiroperandus,11/27/2021,1,,I think its often underestimated how mechanically bad a lot of bronze/iron players really are.  I have a friend in a similar situation and I would spec his games and try to see if I could offer advice... he was an adc main in bronze 3 just absolutely failing every play he went for. I was kinda shocked because just watching his clicks and stuff was so painful.   People say that bronze players could just think or whatever. But maybe they cant. I legit dont think its possible to win with this guy on your team as your adc.
hmc5o5b,GearheadGaming,11/27/2021,1,91.0,At the start of the clip were 16:30 in and blue team is up 8.5k gold.  We end the clip around 17:15 and now theyre up 10.5k gold.  Not bad.  But if you look at the replay tracker at the bottom somehow the game goes on another ~20 minutes and even more bizarrely it looks like blue side *loses the game*.  How strong can Axiom Arc be if youre up 10k+ gold with it and can still lose the game?

hm8vi28,Anarchontologist,11/27/2021,1,121.0,How is this a super team? Doran and Lehends are super team players? Peanut? Hell no.  Id give Chovy and Ruler. Thats about it.  Peanut is soooo hyper dependent on meta and mental. If neither of those are syncd that dude is a Sad Boy. Doran might not even make a top 10 Eastern top laner list. Id have to think about it. Lehends is solid. Wouldnt say hes like a top 5 support in the World.
hmbdfq7,Keldricc,11/27/2021,1,,It already gives a 33% reduced damage output but the thing is you also take 40% less damage while revived by Chemtech soul so it’s also harder to die from getting hit.
hmbzqlk,TheSoupKitchen,11/27/2021,1,,Life saving shield Im Shieldbow is a great idea for ADCs. Not so great when Yone Yasuo and Irelia have it and its just a lifesaving shield for them when theyre the one diving the ADC.  I really wish steraks and shieldbow passives would die. (Also the massive active healing on goredrinker). I dont need everyone to be Olaf winning exchanges at 10% hp and having a fabricated level of close fights. Zhonyas GA and the newer crown item are examples of GOOD life saving items  and shieldbow and steraks are not.

hmc61d2,PersonalSherpa,11/27/2021,1,17.0,I play a lot of Jinx (awful mana costs) and what I do is buy a Faerie Charm around my first or second back.  Costs 250 and sells for 175 so you’re bascially sacrificing a cannon minion for an entire 50% increase in mana regen.  If you use this tech just make sure to venmo me royalties.
hmc771z,Moon_Breaker,11/27/2021,1,3.0,If you stand across the wall for a moment **and the ward is in the sweeper range** then yes it will disable it before youre visible.  Competent players will see see the ward go down and know youre there but they wont actually see your character.  &#x200B  Generally speaking if youre using it just to disable a ward the value comes in them not knowing *exactly* what youre doing or where.  They know you appeared on the ward for a moment but not much more than that.  Personally I use my sweeper to clear wards more than to disable them - If the enemy is up so far that disabling(But not removing) it would help then just running through it will normally work even without the sweeper.  &#x200B  My standard move when I find a ward with my sweeper is to clear it unless the gank is ridiculously free either way(In which case I often wont waste my sweeper on the way in anyway).  After clearing it you can use the fog to make the gank 5-10s later rather than running through the disabled ward.  Pretty much any player with map awareness will see it be disabled and run so youre just as well off running through it without sweeping.  The sweeper is more valuable for actually clearing them.  &#x200B  All just my opinion of course but it works for me.

hmcj0xi,The_Mash,11/27/2021,1,,And so Mordekaiser was cast out of the material realm. However unbeknownst to anyone he had planned for this—indeed it was a pivotal part of his design. Domination and deceit had carried him far but he knew that a destiny far grander than the Hall of Bones awaited him. Apparently he also anticipated it

hmbnhgp,Zp00nZ,11/27/2021,1,156.0,They’re also some of the strongest magic items currently in the world. They destroyed the world once almost voiding the world of life.  Basically ryze is kinda like the magic Batman of league with some prep time he can use the runes to beat anyone.

hma4rj3,FoundationSimple4358,11/27/2021,1,440.0,Thats good to know and a good move from rito. Once implemented youre right and that fixes the name issue. Theres a reason theres more and more people with weird characters in their IGNs. In such a popular game name exclusivity might not be that fun for new players  Might be a bit of a backend work for all of the op.gg u.gg sites if they implement tag IDs though but thats not ritos problem
hmcf8st,Glum-Snow6081,11/27/2021,1,705.0,Honestly i miss the old team ranked ypu queue up as 5 ppl vs 5ppl and you play team vs team its alot more fun to me atleast but hey instead we got flex the normal game ranked mode you play with your friends if you arent exactly 4 ppl because why not

hmc72qz,GarryTheCarry,11/27/2021,1,48.0,EU have too many different cultures to be represented with just one champion   Many league champions are based on European history but there is not single one to represent whole Europe together because EU have too many different cultures to be represented with just one champion    For example Olaf can represent northern Europe countries but he have nothing to do with rest of Europe or Panthen can represent Greece Sejuani or Volibear can represent Russia etc
hma1jj9,Adept-Type,11/27/2021,1,9.0,Those videos are hype but I like how they have a simple script:  * Mages always get the short stick * Tanks cant do anything * Irelia will beat you 99% of scenarios  That also reminds me why I ban irelia for almost a year now.
hm9tvjf,nyasiaa,11/27/2021,1,,what part of not improving until elo inflation pushes them to plat (not really inflation just riot changing the percentages for each rank to be lower) is exactly doing well?  if someone was iron and decided to try hard and got to gold thats an achievement good job you can be proud of your improvement staying in gold for 6 years after that is nothing special  taking 6 years to barely get to plat in preseason doesnt show any dedication to improvement not to mention its achieved by playing eve so the person clearly doesnt care about improvement and just plays to win and cheese the plat   and while yes someone can be proud of whatever rank they are in that does not mean they are playing the game correctly even if you define good as better than average you still have to admit that basically every single click a gold/plat/diamond and especially below player does is basically a mistake and an incorrect decision
hmd1kle,edgelordweeb_,11/27/2021,1,,Gori has no reason to join TSM really. He should easily be able to get a starting spot on a legitimately good LPL team. RA is the most obvious example since BLG should be taking FoFo back. If RA manages to get Angel then Weibo will need a mid laner still.

hmd2bs6,DangerousSeaweed0,11/27/2021,1,569.0,thats one way of looking at it i guess.  the simple fact is that magic is extremely volatile and dangerous and should be controled. Imagine people just running around with enough power to nuke a country if they are ever pissed of or go nuts.  try to think what current goverments would do if mages randomly started apearing in the world. The fact of the matter is that as much as sylas wants to act a revoluationary and a martyr in this situation.....hes straight up wrong.....meaning hes being the bad guy for bad reasons. i dont think that qualifies as an antihero then

hmbxo28,SNSDave,11/27/2021,1,641.0,The first part has literally no bearing. You werent doing anything special you were literally doing the bare minimum of being a good player. Then when you went off you got punished. If somebody has never gotten punished in their life and spends an entire game spewing hate speech and death threats guess what...theyre probably gonna lose their account.

hmbyyd0,LegInfinite245,11/27/2021,1,1.0,Yes preseason MMR matters. Because most of the community is stupid and doesnt understand that people troll in preseason. Then they get surprised when the new season starts and they get placed an entire league down (by design) with shit lp gains/losses instead of the +25/-10 that lets you get back to your actual rank in a handful of games.

hma5g2z,markBEBE,11/27/2021,1,29.0,Nuguri is so unprofessional during the time in Fpx tbh. He can not speak Chinese relies on Doinb to translate in game meanwhile every other Korean players like Viper and Tarzan are already able to call important plays in Chinese while playing. He even refuses to communicate with his teammates when his tension is down such childish and selfish behavior.
hm99chf,DupreeWasTaken,11/27/2021,1,566.0,There was a post a long time ago (ill link it) about how Kindred and Jhin were developed from the same champion design and that they have a LOT of similarities.

hmbj7hq,Amduwatt,11/27/2021,1,13.0,if riot had to gather 8 players below 30lvl you all would have to wait like 20 minutes for a game.  also you will learn the game faster when LOSING AGAINST BETTER PLAYERS rather than killing other noobs.
hma3c39,Koersfanaat,11/27/2021,1,149.0,DLs mom literally was murdered during play-offs and he still played Finals (and won). Enough said about dedication strong will and commitment to the team. The difference with Upset couldnt be bigger.
hm9ewc4,Nocturnezbreako,11/27/2021,1,18.0,Literally why riot should not touch old champs even if they are outdated just stat check them.  Revert stridebreaker too while ur at it as I dont play lol anymore

hmas354,maxexclamationpoint,11/27/2021,1,129.0,That doesnt change that China has the largest player base and makes them the most money. Yes they were booming before then but now thats where a ton of their revenue comes from so of course theyre going to try to keep that going.
hm97tl2,reportedbymom,11/27/2021,1,,Excuse me? You really say YOUR bug to gey get tracked and fixed hows that hes or our bug?    Isnt the bug direct result of Riots inconsistency and lack of effort? Dont get me wrong not a diss but every bug in live version of a game is preventable. Yes EVERY BUG. With good management high stantards clean and well designed code (i think Riot is fucked with this one before LoL 2 comes out) high work morale (i think this also Riot is fucked sexual harashment and other very unethical shit). And many other ways... But i would never call those bugs YOUR bugs to a player that makes pretty damn good report about bugs that are caused by MISTAKES of riot employees involved with the code. Instead i would send him some goodies...

hmdakvb,SocialistScissors,11/27/2021,1,535.0,Whether or not my vayne is actually good is besides the point. The reason I lost the next 5 games was because I was tilted.

I might not be Uzi on Vayne but I can guarantee that my play was significantly better during my winstreak than when I was tilted. I was basically the sole reason my team lost those 5 games. In every single one of them I was basically running it down.

hmcl57v,MoonDawg2,11/27/2021,1,435.0,> This is a pretty irrelevant metric given that you have to play solo in challenger  It is relevant when were talking about the power level of a class. How relevant that class is at the top level is a very good representation of it.  > given that you have to play solo in challenger whereas 99.99% of players can play duo which seriously increases the power of adcs.  Honestly [this post just says everything I can and better](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/qvzca3/with_the_conclusion_of_the_2021_season_here_are/). Adc sucks your point of it being soloQ is irrelevant when support representation is also in line with every single other role.  > Strong mythics each champ viable with at least 2 very strong options for dps survivability mobilty  Again the big issue is the 2 item spike. Also other classes use our own mythics better.   Also the reality of ADC mythics is this: Dps Agressiveness and Burst. If you use galeforce for mobility youre trolling. If you use shieldbow to not be as agressive as possible youre trolling. Riot doesnt know how to do defensive items.  > Second item is flexible between early power (collector) scaling (LDR) and champ/game specific options (runaans rfc wits end ER PD)  And they all have a massive power dip minus collector... Ish. Collector is still not ideal.   I dont care about the item diversity honestly. I care about the power that items bring and atm its extremely lackluster compared to all other roles. Also the reality is PD second is the best nearly every single time on adc that go that route while collector is on the same situation for adc that go for that route. The diversity is useless.  > Third is tied to IE 90% of the time but some champs can definitely use rageblade well instead. Rageblade also opens up bork as a good item into some teamcomps.  On-hit. Though rageblade for on-hit carries is usually better second (which is also lackluster but hey so is life). Going for botrk means you give up on LDR and by the 4th item slot thats usually what you want. Botrk got hard nerfed when they removed the ability to use its active manually. Likely one of the worst item changes theyve ever done.  Again infinity third item is still lackluster not the diversity of the third item spike.  > To finish you pick 2 of the 2nd item options (except collector) or GA mortal reminder bloodthirster QSS depending on what you need on an individual or team level.  Youre talking about diversity? GA is fine 4th mortal reminder is legitimately trolling because it cuts your damage and your defensive option and QSS while decent is still 1300 gold for already being hit which is why you almost never see it now a days. Really few exceptions when its actually worth it and even then stopwatch beats it every day of the week.  > If you have been building every game on every adc how you described in that comment then you are very simply hard trolling.  Hard trolling enough that I can smurf my way through D1 with 70%+ wr and see every single other adc player build the same way I do.  Crit AA: Kraken - PD - Infinity 95% of the time. ONLY time you build LDR third is because of somebody else is doing the damage and struggling with a tank.  Crit ability: Gale - Collector - Infinity. Same deal as up there 4th and 5th item is between ldr and GA. Minor exception here is Kaisa who is forced to build PD third which is why I never do this build on her. You get outscaled too quickly.  On-hit: Shiedlbow - Guinsoo - witz end/PD. Same deal as upstairs with ldr and GA.  Think that covers nearly every adc in the game minus the lethality builds that have been hard nerfed and ezreal. BT is only bought when GA is on CD.  > Riot have basically said themselves they think adc itemisation is in a good spot if they didnt they would have patched up the holes in preseason.  And they also think champions are not overloaded LMAO

hmalon9,PopsicleIncorporated,11/27/2021,1,129.0,What if these two things were attached to Rift Herald? If you kill both Rift Heralds before two dragons the map changes to either the Chemtech or Hextech version. Otherwise its just the main 4 elemental maps.
hm9rkyb,Bluepanda800,11/27/2021,1,62.0,If we are fine with potentially game breaking abilities the ice map could have snow piles that when walked over give players a snowball in one of their summoner spell slots that lasts for ~30 seconds that lets players hit enemy champs then on recast fly over to them like in ARAM.  The piles could slowly generate up to 5 snowballs and it works like a first come first served basis where you take a snowball reducing the number in the pile so there are less there for other people to take.  The dragon itself could give increased tenacity/slow resist to the team that takes it and the soul could grant a spell shield like buying edge of night/banshees veil or something.

hmae8do,Akait0,11/27/2021,1,376.0,Upset did say why he was leaving family emergency and explained the details to Yamato (and apparently the other coach as well)  DL says that he should have explained until the rest of his teammates felt that it was a justified reason. No he shouldnt. What constitutes a justified reason? Some people will never find justifiable leaving just before worlds no matter how bad the situation is. Others (like apparently Hyli) find justified his decision without having to further elaborate. Justifiable reason is not a measure because different people consider it vastly different and you cant appease everyone.   Im not denying that what Upset did screwed their teammates. But Adam taking it to social media just screams inmature child.  Sure Adam can be understandably mad (IMO big part of this is on the coaching staff that failed to answer the questions players had around Upsets departure and/or calm the tension between the players because if Upset is playing next year for FNC it means that they were ok with him leaving yet failed to convey that to the players) but what he should have done is reaching to Upset. If that didnt work then just shut up and move on. Hes not on that org anymore.  Instead he started to speculate about the reasons for leaving because like a spoiled child he couldnt get the answer so he throws a tantrum because fuck Upset.   And I want to clarify that Im not defending Upsets decision to leave. If he ever decides to disclose it maybe I agree or maybe I find it absolutely ridiculous. But what Adam did is definitely being a shitty teammate.  This just reminds me that the LoL professional community is full of kids. I remember I used to like Bwipo but when he went to that Podcast and basically flamed Nemesis it really left a bad taste. Then all the drama surrounding his gf during this worlds further proves the inmaturity. But then again Nemesis also started speculating about Upsets abscense talking about cover-ups and using it as an opportunity to shit on FNC.  Inmaturity all around.

hmckk5q,PixiCode,11/27/2021,1,440.0,World runes were (probably) not made by mortals like humans. They were discovered and studied which eventually lead to the wars. As far as I’m aware it’s not explained who made the world runes or what ultimate purpose they serve. It could be related to the mysterious creation of Runeterra because Aurelian Sol said he was interested in Runeterra because ‘he doesn’t know anything about Runeterra besides that he did not create it.’ And well… it’s called Runeterra. It’s in the name haha
hm9r297,EinNichtwaehler,11/27/2021,1,539.0,...Err no? ...How do you even get to this conclusion...? Please do not conflate every Redditor with being random or having no basis. But anyways:  1) LS has comments on how he regards Max Waldo as conflict-avoidant when put against strong personalities. 2) Observation from behaviour onstream over the years from when he still was LS house. Doesnt seem extroverted to me. Noted indications to him being averse like trailing off conflicts (e.g. Yeah...) or not being proactive/ knowing how to handle specific situations (LS anger moments being the thing that stand out). 3) Do you have any counter-evidence that point to him being extroverted or conflict-averse?

hm8zays,Treyofzero,11/27/2021,1,131.0,Skarner teaches me constantly the futility of playing the game with tactics and teamwork when you are on the bottom of the champion roster instead of the top. You lose so much to high damage as a cc bot and not-true tank you cant build any items or play any strategies to secure a win. Its full on reliance on everyone else in the game to make up for and inversely not capitalize on your glaring insurmountable weaknesses the ultimate self sabotage when you so much as pick the champ. Im sure this isnt skarner unique though but boy it is a special type of torture playing him.

hmcea87,Valkyrai,11/27/2021,1,395.0,Yeah but Aurelion has the feeling of being that strong because hes a godlike star dragon that can create galaxies. It doesnt diminish a strong but smaller scale character like an ascended because hed wreck them. Jax in the old lore on the other hand is just... Some guy? Iirc he was an unremarkable mercenary and there wasnt much going on in his lore outside of being OP. Id like to at least know whats so special about him that lets him be stronger than demigods.

hmcspee,Sangreal11,11/27/2021,1,490.0,Aurelion is not the creator of the universe. He creates stars but not even all the stars. If he was the creator of the universe how come mere aspects of a mountain can enslave him?  Edit: From wiki As one of the oldest living beings in the universe Aurelion Sol has witnessed the rise and fall of countless worlds. Even so the one that piqued his interest and curiosity was Runeterra as he did not know who created it only that it had not been him.[1]  As suggested by his writer Aurelion Sol did not create all the stars just a majority of them. This is further confirmed by 1 of  Zoes quotes in game

hm9ba97,H4SK1,11/27/2021,1,14.0,Dude the whole play was a mistake. They go in 3v4 (without waiting for Gwen) into fog of war. If Rakan and Voli play properly its an easy win for the red team. Im not sure if Azir has r or not but I highly doubt they track it as well. Just because a play works out doesnt mean its a good one.

hmd6ped,Zorrodx,11/27/2021,1,,How is draft one bad for DL? They massively out range they have 3 winning lanes they outscale the onus was on Core team to win early and they didn’t do that. Sniper got caught   once by stepping up to wave he didn’t have to Dl got caught numerous times and positioned terribly in many of the fights. Then by third dragon their comp despite being set so far behind when the fight was front to back and they played reasonably wel weird how they won that fight pretty fucking easily as Core’s team couldn’t approach. Then DL sees they are doing baron and decides to face check the left bush with zero awareness of how easy it is to turn on him. But I guess that’s the drafts fault playing reasonably well is too hard I guess the players aren’t robots. I guess they had no “front” line. Meanwhile if you unironically gave this draft to Cores team they win 9/10 now it isn’t a shit draft. Really interesting analysis there buddy and I’m the high one XD.

hma3t97,hiccup333,11/27/2021,1,12388.0,Exactly.  You have to deliver in a satisfying way each segment of a story in this case season 1.  Like you can still have cliffhanger endings in a story but the story still delivers.  Like Avengers Infinity War comes to mind.   But here I felt shortchanged  You risk viewers not wanting to follow along with you to the next season because youve lost their trust in a way.  The tv show LOST is a famous example of it

hmbied1,random_stoner,11/27/2021,1,57.0,Its a term from back in the day like season 2 or earlier where aram wasnt an official game mode yet. People back In the day would create custom games called ARAM played on summoners rift and you kinda had to hope that everyone played by the unofficial rules which today are normal aram rules. Like no buying or healing until dead random champion etc.
hmd9yta,Big_Cheesecake_4910,11/27/2021,1,582.0,holy fuck that art is SO bad
hm9p5g9,deediazh,11/27/2021,1,13.0,There is no wrong when both abilities are that good it comes down to preference of clear speed vs ganking power. Although people has settle for the best of both worlds 3 points into Q so it gives a nice early jungle clear and then W for good damage once you transform.
hmb4hx3,UnironicallyWatchSAO,11/27/2021,1,206.0,This is false on so many levels its not even funny.

hmb7d1d,Mrmoi356,11/27/2021,1,,Bro I fucking main Fiora. I could give 0 shits about how Yone and Yas are doing because I can simply fuck them over with one ability the problem rn tho is that LT makes the cooldown for Q so small that they can beat anyone in a 1v1 duel at any stage as long as they are not behind.  Its broken af stop letting who you main get in the way of common sense. Yone literally has a 60%+ winrate in top lane currently. How are you going to argue that is in any way balanced?

hm9zx7t,mogadichu,11/27/2021,1,21.0,I exaggerated a bit for dramatic effect but picking up a couple of objectives will make a hyper-carry about 400 gold richer than they would be last patch which can be absolutely massive since they usually start outscaling you at around two items.

hmcwz4r,IlDaydreamIl,11/27/2021,1,20.0,I burned flash and galeforce it didnt matter. After he flash+Rd I didnt even try to kite I just ran away. He still reached me without E or R and finished me off. I can kite good with a-move and I like to think that Im pretty decent with adc after all this time playing.  But it has reached a point where I find it easier to outplay and kite an assassin than a tank. At least if you build shieldbow and use flash after assassins used their mobility tools you can outplay them. With tanks you cant most of the time...

hm9xtla,LeThomsen,11/27/2021,1,,It is tough - I got 3 of them..  I did use to play I played LoL raid in WoW and HotS it took all my freetime lucky I have a husbond who also played. Neither of us have the time today - well he play D&D games on Fridays online with his friends.  Honestly I did play a bit when I got my first child - not proud of this but a part of me wanted to play way more than I could and in a brief moment I chose gaming over my kid and then I realized that I had to stop playing.. Got my priorities wrong there and it was a wakeup call! So I chose to stop the same day.  It was not easy to stop because I really did like gaming - I did not game on a high level at all (except for wow). But it was all about choices.   The people I know IRL are not in the gaming world and they have no clue what it is all about. They dont get it and I know I cant talk to them about it.. I do miss the nerdy friends online.

hma3svr,Koersfanaat,11/27/2021,1,149.0,True. This would have never been a drama if Upset had handled it professionally from day 1. Explain yourself clearly to your team PR sends out private issues to the fans and with support from the team mates they would have accepted it. No team mates mental booming or putting out twitlongers and thats it. Now its just such a mess that only putting out the truth to the public would resolve everything. It isnt our business but he has created this shithole himself.
hmc9iil,Excalidorito,11/27/2021,1,406.0,I disagree with this.  My hate for assassins comes mostly from the fact that their kit often have some of the most frustrating mechanics of the game like stealth insane mobility and untargetability.  Outside of Dirk which is hilariously underpriced their items aren’t actually that good. If I’m honest I’m far more scared of the potential Axiom Arc might have on non-assassin champs. I know Panth is kinda borderlining between bruiser and assassin but his map pressure goes up so much from that item.
hmcsfv5,calmtigers,11/27/2021,1,44.0,They either want to play but not make as much or stream… clearly the market is hard driving these historically good domestic players but trash intl into the ground.

hm8z2md,Migster257,11/27/2021,1,15.0,Not that weird. Most adcs take biscuits + tonic. Lets you lane forever (good bc this basically makes TP not necessary so you can take a combat summoner) and take trades you normally wouldn’t be able to. Doublelift goes much more in depth on this in one of his videos

hm95ylx,AweKartik777,11/27/2021,1,16.0,No champ can do it early game. Some bruisers can do it late game or mid-game if they got pretty fed. Nasus at one point can just 2-3 shot turrets with his Q (with like a 1-2 seconds CD between casts) due to infinite stacking.       Some non-bruiser AP champs might be able to do it as well but not sure.

hmc41hx,1nc000,11/27/2021,1,265.0,In case you want an actual explanation it isn’t a bug.  If you auto while pressing R your invisibility gets cancelled fully and the blades follow the target you attacked.  If you R while mid-q-flight then you won’t go invis at all and the blades will go to the target.

hmd5r5k,M0b1us_Str1pp3r,11/27/2021,1,108.0,To expand on your point (IDK where exactly in the thread to put this) 2 points define a line and a third point defines a plane if it doesnt lie on the line defined by 2 other points. Since any 2D shape can define a plane (the plane that it sits on) 3 points are the minimum for a 2D shape.  On a tangential note this reminds me of when I was a fifth-grader Id have a blast drawing a line segment and adding another point. Connect all points and boom: triangle. Add another point and connect all points and boom: tetrahedron. Add yet another connect all points and voila: a tesseract lol. I thought it was so neat lmao.   Of course you cant actually make a tesseract using plastic straws because just like how the point has to lie *outside* of the line segment to make a triangle youd have to put the point outside of 3d space. If you try and make a tesseract anyway what youll be looking at is kind of like what a 1D creature experiences looking at the side view of a triangle (just 3 dots on a line). The 1D creature cant meaningfully experience a triangle as rotating the third point so the triangle shows its surface puts the third point (as well as the surface) outside of the scope of the 1D creatures vision.   Anyway its all grade school stuff that you already know but it feels good putting it into words.
hmaypoa,Qwwerweii,11/27/2021,1,112.0,Since you choose to take 18 million to this team then please pay extra effort. No excuses at the very least you need to learn some simple phrases instead of having your teammates distracted during the game to translate for you

hmcq1zd,Catspirit123,11/27/2021,1,490.0,I dont think Ryze works as a protagonist cause hes already so old and wise. Hes much better as a supporting figure imo. His job means he travels all over the world which makes for good set up in an anthology though. Having him be a bridge to different stories and worlds works better than him as a focus I think. Id say he would make a good mentor figure too but Brand might disagree...
hm9cfd7,WintersEnvoy,11/27/2021,1,4.0,Hes super all in practically a melee mage. Like with most melees you play around his lack of range and CC/target him down. No special trick if you get 4 man Rd you try to not scatter in a way where he hits all 4 with his E since he will pool to get it off if he isnt pooled you stun and run he usually plays for flanks because there should be no way he does this walking into your team since his playstyles so obvious and lacks (to an extent) versatility adcs are doomed vs even an inting vlad so theyre gonna insta run if they get ulted because theyll die to his combo without tons of MR.   I guess certain slow champs also counter him more than usual since he can only (pre?)pool and rocketbelt a short distance but yes very all in kit at short range but also low cooldowns so you cant let this guy sit around because hes gonna hit hard and heal a lot in a fight he isnt insta targeted as if he was kogmaw. He is the primary target unless you completely sack your backline (I guess that can be fine sometimes bruisers probably beat him) but since his range is so short he generally cant play a more hit and run style like other mages

hm9bu8n,Quazz,11/27/2021,1,359.0,The only reason the servers are split is because the combined EU server in early days of league caught fire on the regular.  Even now when something like clash launches EUW is the region most likely to hit issues and catch fire.  Combining the servers sounds simple in theory but in practice we can expect a lot of issues perhaps not to the extent to season 2/3 anymore (hopefully the way its all set up is much better now) but still.

But idk if this is a glitch or maybe I just read the mission list wrong but I was under the impression that I was unlocking several champions from completing missions but when I go to the collection its just the one character you pick from the tutorial.   So i guess my question is does the game really reward characters or am I just stuck grinding it out?
hmb1ni2,LoLrovex,11/27/2021,1,341.0,I think 137 games is a lot for masters. In the early seasons before smurf queue you could get masters in like 50\~ games. But I also didnt lose that much when I was climbing the lower ranks.

What I would like to see is the range getting streamlined to 50 for all champs then buffing ranged AS accordingly so there still is an AS rune for ranged champs that isnt limited to the first 3 auto attacks.

hm9kzvh,MuhammedAlistar,11/27/2021,1,2.0,Not that I disagree but rule of thumb is artillery mages have a 5-15% less damage enchanters are nerfed a lot but still are strong melee champions receive less damage marksmen deal 5-10% less damage and assassins usually have a damage boost.  Then there are annoying champions like Teemo who get huge damage debuff. Basically if you think this is op in champion select then the champion is probably nerfed to the ground.  Honestly ARAM deserves better balancing but the player base isnt big enough for Riot to care.

hmakldu,MoonDawg2,11/27/2021,1,115.0,Its not big for exception of a few adc  You need some natural steroids to make lethal worth it or just be extremely ahead. If you have either of the two its actually really strong but apart from that its pretty shit. Cait for example is extremely underwhelming with it because of lacking a steroid but jinx for example is extremely strong with it because of q atk speed or the bonus 10% dmg and once its stacked she massively abuses her own passive.     Just a badly made rune tbh.
hmcsxpp,Sangreal11,11/27/2021,1,490.0,Did they change the lore? The last time I read it Sol did not create cosmos. He created some of the stars while claiming he is the creator of all stars. If he created cosmos he wouldnt be enslaved by mere aspects of a mountain.  Edit: From wiki As one of the oldest living beings in the universe Aurelion Sol has witnessed the rise and fall of countless worlds. Even so the one that piqued his interest and curiosity was Runeterra as he did not know who created it only that it had not been him.[1]  As suggested by his writer Aurelion Sol did not create all the stars just a majority of them. This is further confirmed by 1 of Zoes quotes in game

Matt was probably a top 3 support in 2018 (granted this was before CoreJJ and Vulcan were LCS)  but that roster was pretty trash and he got dumped for Olleh since Reddit narrative said obviously Matt and Lourlo were the biggest problems so the org obliged wanting to save face after back to back 10th place finishes.  At the least Matt was the strongest support in lane in 2018 was consistently winning lane with Deftly everyones favorite KDA player. Knowing that he was a guy who always struggled with haters Im not surprised that him getting pushed to academy pretty much killed the momentum he built in 2018.

hmb5r48,tanezuki,11/27/2021,1,89.0,Some AD champions like Ezreal have AP scalings and can totally have AP builds even if theyre not meta.   Some champions cannot do that those whos scalings are entirely AD but its clear in their identity that theyre not AP champions.   Juggernauts are the champions closest in defensive stats to tanks.   I wouldnt care the slightest if I cant use Runaan on Sett but making one of the most important tank items in this meta unusable is just annoying.   Nasus is my prime example because Im a main and you dont build anything than Divine Sunderer before going tank except for maybe Sterak. The fact you can get ultra kited means you have to buid like a tank because otherwise youll just never get into melee to anything while remaining alive.
hmcts5u,MyManSteveBuscemi,11/27/2021,1,262.0,Just buff the other souls then. Souls should be more powerful than Elder. It is way harder to get 4 dragons than kill 1 Elder. Teams should need to prioritize dragons period.

hmamqff,SP3EDI,11/27/2021,1,392.0,because the other partys involved already mentioned it ? Alphari as fnatic itself already mentioned it. Its normal for a Player to ask his ex teammate about the team like alphari did. Its also normal for the org to ask upset about alphari and if he wants to play with him again. Like literally almost all the player changes in history work like this.
hmcjx8g,ZirvePS,11/27/2021,1,65.0,I mean its ok. I dont want to build void or shadowflame because without their pen they are subpar items. And if the enemy has a little mr I have to get void. The price for their mr is not defense in this case but that I have to get void which means either Ill do less damage than if they hadnt gotten mr or Ill have less utility because I got void instead of rabadon zhonyas banshees etc.
hmb92r0,moodRubicund,11/27/2021,1,,Does he actually have involvement in most stories? Hes mostly on his own doing his own thing.  Also I honestly dont think that was Ryze who gave Jayce the stone. Mostly because he gave Jayce a stone which is not a very Ryze thing to do. Plus hes not blue? And he doesnt have a scroll? Really the only thing tying that random mage to Ryze is teleportation magic which apparently anyone can learn given how Jayce managed to repurpose it for his hexgates.
hma9a4u,Random_Guy_12345,11/27/2021,1,10.0,If team B has stronger teamfight than team A then team B should have stopped team A from grabbing soul. If team B despite having better teamfighting was unable to win those teamfights on dragon then either team B got outplayed or do not have such a clear advantage.  At the end of the day _something_ is needed to enable teams to close out games. I agree that there is a disparity on soul powers but id rather have _all_ souls on chemtech level than nerfing all to past-season-cloud level.
hmcvmhu,KeyserJ,11/27/2021,1,58.0,Sett he already has the physical advantage but being a natural magic creature is a huge deal-breaker even more since he is a professional fighter using vastayah bloodline (he being unmatchable in a noxian ring using only his hands is pretty telling too the guys use everything: humans weapons minotaurs vastayahs even fauna). That aside Vi and Sett would probably be good punching bros both have strong parental influence behind them.

Sleepy Trouble Bubbles Sleep particle effects work properly for all of her skins *except* Star Guardian. This means they even got it right for skins that came after these ones.  Theyve demonstrated they can make Zoes abilities work the way they are meant to. This makes me think that resolving these issues shouldnt be too demanding.  &#x200B  What you describe sounds like it was a fundamental issue with Mordekaiser *himself* not any particular skin of his.

hmchaqt,bondsmatthew,11/27/2021,1,,People always only mention assassins with the item yet Riven and Trynd at one point built Essence Reaver even though they dont care for mana at all. Garen built Trinity because the passive and stats were good for him.  People need to stop being one dimensional just because an item says its for assassins doesnt mean other champions cant abuse it. Varus with a lower CD ult Xayah with a lower CD ult Tryndamere with a lower CD ult MF with a lower CD ult. If it means your ult will be up for the next skirmish(not teamfight) then yes it could be beneficial in some situations hence why I said At its best case its way too powerful

hm9yc4r,tanezuki,11/27/2021,1,70.0,Gargoyle is good against burst and Force of Nature is a magic resistance item.   Death Dance makes you way too squishy and isnt a juggernaut item.   Ill always build Randuin because its literaly the only viable armor item I can build Frozen Heart misses HP and Thornmail is not exploitable.
hmc7oup,SadPiccolo7701,11/27/2021,1,15.0,Then how can I farm properly and not get ganked in lv6 with both sett and his jungler under my turrent and lost herald and my turrent. Those lane bastards could create so many advantage in the early game![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|dizzy_face)
hmd0laq,IlDaydreamIl,11/27/2021,1,,1 item advantage in an assassin is really noticeable dmg-wise. 1 item advantage in a tank should be noticeable tanky-wise. Idk I feel like the people who say tanks are fine never play adc or squishy champs with low mobility. It must be only me maybe Im dumb for thinking the class who can take tons of dmg and ignore turrets should not be able to also 100-0 people with a single combo like an assassin.  That Blitzcrank with **1 item and 2 levels less than me** doing 724 dmg in 3 seconds with just Q+R+normal auto(Not even E) is normal too then? He did 40% of my HP with 2 skills and 1 auto. He couldve done more dmg with E he just didnt need it. So probably he wouldve done 50%.  If 1 item and 1 lvl is miles ahead why is a support with all tank items 2 levels and 1 item below me doing 40-50% of my HP with just 3 skills?

hmbgbbc,Cahecher,11/27/2021,1,,Thats exactly my point 369 cannot be left alone because hell find a way to die. Id say hes similar with JL though JL is not as bad with his ints. In the case of 369 it seems to my bronzie redditors eyes that he forgets enemy team exists while JL just tries to outplay every fight (be it 2v2 or 2v5) so having both of them on a team at the same time is somewhat problematic. Imo thats part of the reason Karsa looked completely lost since every decision he made was a mistake because of these two. A similar thing happened with JL and TheShy in iG - they became dysfunctional at some point.  Hence I am really happy 369 and JL arent going to play on the same team and I am specifically excited about the idea of Zoom playing in TES. Zoom can be a threat on his own allowing JL to shine (at least on paper it can be this way).   Also while its important that 369 is criticized its not like this guy has no talent - mechanically hes insane on his carry champions but he lacks awareness.
hmchnyo,Craftingistheway,11/27/2021,1,387.0,Yeah obvious because for \*insert giga random argument here\* reasons you ganking that lane succesfully is obv a false gameplan and if you dont gank his lane you are actually dumb as fuck not understanding \*insert giga random argument here\*.     Therefore now building defensive and play the fuck safe is no longer the adapation it is YOUR fault he hard ints his lane and make an easy game hard. Bonus points for not building boots until mystic is finished so every gank/roam will work on them which is your fault.

hmcmo6z,SilenceOfRage,11/27/2021,1,7.0,It is funny because if you said more than one year ago (during summer 2020) there was a team composed of jensen doublelift and svenskeren people would think oh yeah make sense it look good on paper/has some promise and then you tell them you lied and they dont have a team at all and I am sure everyone would say wtf.  It is crazy how much things changes in more than a year and we are not even talking about some teams and their roller coaster like fpx or fnc.

hm9coe3,KingFredo5674,11/27/2021,1,568.0,I want to say for the record I only had 4 hours of sleep when I wrote that comment I however take full responsibility for the laughter that ensued
hm94xg9,LoLrovex,11/27/2021,1,219.0,just keep farming and keep your gold income up and hope enemy makes mistakes
hm9a0py,hyxaru,11/27/2021,1,54.0,Are you aware of two recent Yorick buffs that give him a somewhat large advantage? Although it’s hard to make practical use of it.
hmcogml,12thBlessing,11/27/2021,1,455.0,Just for context I havent heard people name the champions but I have heard the song played or referred to by women who have no interest in video games. It had a bigger reach than you think.
hmdbc5k,Zorrodx,11/27/2021,1,,Makes sense. My highest mastery is gangplank but I’m actually a mid laner d2 myself
hmd91rh,transformers03,11/27/2021,1,45.0,As someone who never played LoL and has just loved the show Im hesitant to see other parts of the franchises world and move away from the main story of Vi and Jinx. I do think Riot will adapt other parts of the games lore I just hope it doesnt move too far away from the emotional core from Arcane.  I recognize that it is absurd to expect the whole LoL franchise to center around the story between just two of its 150 characters especially since the series has such dense lore in so many other parts of its world. But that just shows how much I love that storyline in the first season of Arcane.  If the series decides to expand beyond Pitover and Zaun I would still at least want the characters from Arcane season 1 to still have active roles when they do move on.
hm9l231,FeelingDifficulty571,11/27/2021,1,7.0,There are tons of champions across the regions. All very iconic for there own reasons.
hmabyd6,LazerFruit,11/27/2021,1,30.0,Danny was playing support style adc it was kind of just team/macro diff. Breezy was better than zeyzal though imo
hmaj0d8,Potential_Hornet_559,11/27/2021,1,375.0,Making things up?  He just told his side of the story.  He even say he doesn’t know what the situation was and that was his frustration.  From his point of view upset left without much explanation.  And I didnt see any directing his fans to harass Upset  or are you trying to make shit up about Adam?  Are you in Germany?  Maybe you could get sued.
hmd8jg5,YzPoopyRibbon,11/27/2021,1,535.0,>I had a 100% winrate on Vayne across 6 games until   this is such a small sample size that this metric means nothing keep in mind for future. i went 9-0 on orianna mid lane in season 3 then proceeded to reach a 30% winrate with her over the next 40 games in bronze. i went 7-0 on morg in support in plat in season 5 then got absolutely decimated 5 in a row and never played her again.  fun fax
hma0nap,tanezuki,11/27/2021,1,70.0,People uses Bruisers but I find this confusing.  Riven is a bruiser but she isnt a fighter shes a slayer=> Skirmisher.  Yet most people will consider her a bruiser because its a community box category that includes nearly all the Fighters in it them being Juggernauts or Divers aswell as the skirmishers.
hmd1j6c,Braunze,11/27/2021,1,1.0,Honestly Id say just play.  I dont think reading or watching a video about all items will do a lot.  The recommended items to build in shop can be fine.  Or if you want some help with items you can download an app like the blitz app that will add item sets to your shop for the champ you pick.  That or just look up the champion you want to play on a website like lolalytics and see the most popular items that are built.    For champions you can look to see if any in the weekly free rotation are new to toy and try them in the practice tool.  Otherwise just play and YouTube their champion spotlight if you are against someone new to you.
hmcyjwq,choffers,11/27/2021,1,10.0,Old lore her parents get kidnapped implying her mom should still be alive after the explosion but they could retcon caits lore or her dad could remarry. My money says viktors hextech body does some shield shenanigans saving some or all of the council.   I think mel dies making her mom a conduit for noxus involvement in season 2.
hmbkwr1,kenzomon,11/27/2021,1,4.0,Yeah haha something similar happened in a semi finals game at worlds this year.   [https://youtu.be/-i13nj8FOro?t=1116](https://youtu.be/-i13nj8FOro?t=1116)  In this one its sort of the opposite where Jhin is on the low ground so the spell is actually higher than the indicator looks. Jayce sidesteps and it looks like a clean dodge but the W roots him anyway.

Its a level 16 Zac which means rank 3 R. All Im gonna say here is that in season 6 Zac would have killed a mage without any AP.  https://youtu.be/jq3p8fAAD08  timestamp 6:02
hm9wwet,WintersEnvoy,11/27/2021,1,8.0,Playing with friends a lot? Yeah that experience is sorta dead high mmr friends will ruin low mmr ones real fast. And recovering takes ages it is genuinely sad. I pretty much recommend new players not to play premade with old timers it’s just gonna end with them being completely unable to enjoy the game by themselves/without being carried
hmajdoj,BahLo-,11/27/2021,1,375.0,Sure everyone handles it differently the thing is. Im saying i dont think it was that bad of a situation.
hm9zctr,Alarming_Beginning_1,11/27/2021,1,328.0,He said jinx is skinnier so I sent him a cosplay of a girl who fits her body type better. Im not saying this girls cosplay isnt good. Im literally showing him someone elses thats it. And hes totally fine to say jinx is skinnier it doesnt mean hes bashing her. It would be the same if a skinny person was cosplaying Snorlax and someone said Snorlax is bigger. Its simply an observation.
hm8ztrn,GodlyPain,11/27/2021,1,328.0,Honestly yeah... They should remerge them and maybe keep the old server as a high elo server like theyre talking about making for NA and like China has.
hmbi3km,ApplePitou,11/27/2021,1,10.0,I suspect its because of Farm :3
hmc6li5,mazrrim,11/27/2021,1,48.0,I really find it hard to care about ahri when the fact the champ is 10 years old shows in the model.  They really couldnt give the champ that sells such an absurd number of skins a model update when they are doing a 10 year event for her lmao
hmd4kif,vrettossss,11/27/2021,1,4.0,So no one mentioned Fiora? Like 4 autos about 85% max HP at late game

hmck76l,SlakingSWAG,11/27/2021,1,435.0,To be fair its not surprising considering this is the same Riot games that spent like two years trying to balance a Conqueror that gave AD Lifesteal *and* True Damage even though it was very obvious that having all three of those at once was super unbalanced.
hmagw1a,musiclover1c,11/27/2021,1,10.0,There are so many games where i am fed and lose because of inting teammate. Outclass out skill whatever. They just keep repeating it non stop death after death. My mental literally boom. And its so frequent in gold elo. I crush enemy mid lane got fed. i spam farm. Teammate no farm  bot dies 12 time combine feeds enemy. Enemy snowball. Jungle no gank at all afk farm for 20 min . 0 ojective. Keep invading enemy jungle and dies. All of these type of stuff makes me angry.   &#x200B  Or some games if they never die Its 100% winnable all they need to do is dont die. I cant take it anymore. Its torturing. Btw i am solo que no duo. All i meet the people and friendlist all is platinium and above to challenger. Only a few gold elo that acutally good players stuck because of inting teamates. but than they already gave up on rank. Just reach gold and get the skin they already tired and facing same situation as me.
hmcna6w,PepelaTeaTime,11/27/2021,1,64.0,are people actually falling for this bait? lol  Also if we are going to talk about features Ive seen Asians who literally have the whitest skin tone (without the use of BB cream or any other products). Caucasians usually have a more pink tone to their skin.   This is a classic case of European ethnocentrism For example when westerners think anime characters are supposed to represent white Europeans instead of Japanese. You have to realize that East Asians have their own ideal of beauty standards and are not necessarily striving to look white. This whole obsession with certain phenotypes  representing a certain race creeps into race realism anyways so Imma nope out now.
hmcptdk,TargonBoi,11/27/2021,1,,Riot had 0 reasons to remove the winter map in the first place. They are just lazy and do not want to update it to accomodate elemental drake changes.

hm9s6jt,bronet,11/27/2021,1,226.0,Not exactly uncommon to know many songs for a popular band no matter if you like them or not. Most people who hate the Beatles can probably still name 5 songs
hm9m4mc,AweKartik777,11/27/2021,1,130.0,Yeah season 2 is confirmed to not be releasing in 2022 but they havent said anything for 2023 yet most probably that year only.
hmb1czb,stuffslols,11/27/2021,1,12.0,As you get a bit more experience in watching your team and their habits youll start to learn a bit more about which objectives will need help but its mostly a thing that just takes learning and practice no real shortcuts to figuring it out unfortunately.   Its why I quit being a top laner. I can understand the appeal of playing on an island but being forced to watch my team without being able to contribute just wasnt for me.

hmc8qvw,ralanr,11/27/2021,1,48.0,I didn’t know that about Seraphine. Kind of confused as to why.
hmd600f,PLMessiah,11/27/2021,1,127.0,If only franchising didnt happen. Since its too late to stop that there should at least be a better open circuit just like in those games but Riot is too selfish to improve player development in LoL.
hmbrrua,No-Glass3257,11/27/2021,1,187.0,You do realise that leauge of legends is a team sport? Communicating is a part of the game you cant perform if you have no idea what your teammates are saying while in game.

hma3tqk,Mejalu,11/27/2021,1,34.0,If youre playing to gain LP then youre already losing.  You say all this then admit its a problem on your alt account. What? I dont understand your purpose for commenting.  If youre admitting it is a problem then why are you saying otherwise. Youre saying I agree but only under x circumstances then its ok to give up just dont give up.
hm9bsp5,LordTachankaMain,11/27/2021,1,359.0,Huh weird I was sure of it… we even made accounts on it for the sweet 9 ping. But everything I fine online says Frankfurt so I guess we’re just stupid

hma7fdc,SaulJoker,11/27/2021,1,76.0,I mean I myself think that most people don’t build these item combinations which is why I think it’s underappreciated/could work better than what most people are doing.  It’s entirely possible that I’m wrong and that death’s dance/chempunk aren’t worth building but I do think they are. I think Darius Sett and Illaoi could make really good use of those items in fact I don’t see why you would ever go Thornmail over Chempunk on Darius.
hmac95v,ikingjosh,11/27/2021,1,12395.0,I agree.  This telling of the story would have been so much better for it.  The sisters relationship is the heart of the story and robbing us of reconciliation makes the whole thing unsatisfying for me.

Adam doesnt know even the type of the reason why he left(is this health problem or something with material part at least how hard the problem is) so he just feels kinda betrayed.

hmah33e,velkoz_eats_data,11/27/2021,1,21.0,Not every champ can be played in every meta. You sound like a little bitch or maybe just a noob.
hm9m2my,dovekot,11/27/2021,1,36.0,Plot aside the characterizations of the champions was just overall poor. Pyke and Rengar most notably theres no excuse for that.
hmd1xa3,Bastardman9,11/27/2021,1,64.0,i dont think size and physical advantage truly matters here cuz vi has been shown to beat up guys several times her size even when she was an unexperienced child (and she has gather alot of experience fighting in prision as the league client said)  which probably is cuz she seems quite talented at hand to hand combat. but as other people pointed out sett is half vastayan and can use actual magic   could probably put up a fight for a bit but would be inevitably defeated by vastayan magic just being strong as hell lol
hmb1323,boboafett1,11/27/2021,1,2732.0,At first the song is ok because it hypes you up for the action but I was expecting more of a sadder theme once Powder was broken.
hmcm6jj,123janna456,11/27/2021,1,13.0,Ignore Scuttler for most of the games its probably the least mandatory early game money maker for jungler right now.  Avoid 1v1ing against Lethal Tempo skirmishers and First Strike assassins they can be dangerous from early to late.  Theres a bug fix revert that made Shaco so good early game so keep abusing it.
hmauchx,e_zzzz,11/27/2021,1,19.0,Still strong and annoying to play against esp with top and jg bruiser meta. They have been playing inhouses non-public during the off season so they know what’s op or not. Jinx is another strong late game carry. Graves Irelia tf Camille are also broken picks. Enchanters are also in general valuable in most comps. Vex if you can play her but not many pros have practiced her since she wasn’t playable for last season in pro and it’s only pre season
hmc55vv,daudr9,11/27/2021,1,7.0,it will reset but playing during preseason makes sense for few reasons not only you practice more in the game and get to know how new items/changes work but also if you climb in preseason you will start with higher rank when season begins

hma4trx,supapumped,11/27/2021,1,60.0,I have not ran into any Udyr recently as WW but Tiger stance Udyr used to be able to absolutely destroy WW at almost any point of the game in a 1v1.   With the new Lethal tempo and stronger tank items in preseason I am not sure if that is still the case though.

hmalf79,HoloHuni,11/27/2021,1,15.0,Every story lined up so far except maybe Jinx and her  mysterious past. The beginning of WWs lore and the story of Vander in the first act of Arcane pretty much line up
hmag2g3,Exclarius,11/27/2021,1,,> Something happening to you does not absolve you of the consequences of YOUR actions to THEM  The mental gymnastics of the point youre trying to make are staggering. Youre spinning the situation of someone whos dealing with a family trauma into some weird case where he chose to go home for fun. Of course Fnatic did worse than they would have with Upset there but jfc he had a legitimate reason to not be there. If you think your esports time comes before your family youre free to do so but I dont think this would be the case for most people.  Adam can be mad about the situation all he wants but it is not a reason to spread rumors and send his legion to harass Upset.  > No.... just dont be a fucking dick to the people you already screwed over. Not hard.  How is he being a dick? He communicated all he needed to. He didnt just hop on a plane without any communication. To quote Upset:  > I shared the situation with Yamato [Fnatic head coach] and I intended to do the same with Hylissang  ... >  “[Hylissang] knew me well enough as a person and how much I care about competing that he did not even want to know anything and I know people like Yamato and Hyli are friends for life.”  (source: https://www.dexerto.com/league-of-legends/upset-slams-former-fnatic-teammate-adam-over-disgusting-worlds-2021-claims-1706633/)  He did explain himself to a teammate he trusted. Has Hylissang turned this into a shitstorm? No he hasnt. Adam has chosen to be an immature child about this and spin this into something that it did not need to be.
hmc1i7l,Jeyzer,11/27/2021,1,373.0,Sure 100 range is great but we need an AS rune LT isnt an AS rune for marksmen its a range one that we didnt asked for and took the place of a AS keystone that was decent (had some great use on select champs like Azir for example who lost it in exchange for essentially nothing lol).
hm9tb7k,androt14_,11/27/2021,1,43.0,Problem is that Arcane disregarded stablished lore to make a better story SoL disregarded stablished lore to make fart jokes and a character that cant for his fucking life say a serious line
hma9pou,NoBear2,11/27/2021,1,21.0,That would only work if he’s dashing while the sleep finishes. If yone e’s back at any point after getting hit by the bubble it gets cleansed.
hmb71jz,SNSDave,11/27/2021,1,626.0,Yes.
hmbbqwd,FantasyTrash,11/27/2021,1,411.0,Hyli trusts Upset enough to accept a vague reason no questions asked. As a good colleague should.  Adam is immature enough to violate any semblance of trust and air out every little detail of the situation on Twitter despite not even knowing the real reason. We know damn well that if given the true reason it would’ve ended up in his post completely violating Upset’s privacy when it is absolutely not Adam’s business to post such private information.  Basically Adam behaved like a child which he is. Hyli behaved like an adult and professional. Adam openly invited people to harass Upset and his wife with a lengthy public post with incomplete information. I am outwardly calling Adam unprofessional because his actions were unprofessional. No flame towards his personal relations but in the workplace he objectively behaved unprofessionally.
hm9r7xm,tanezuki,11/27/2021,1,60.0,Yeah they made this because range is a primary characteristic that can greatly modify how efficient an item can be when used by those ranged champions.  Juggernauts arent ranged champions afaik. Fimbulwinter specifically adresses that CC issue by having it being slows on melee champions.

Camille began to experiment with herself at 26  so I guess shed be pretty optimized at this point way before Viktor was even born and Hextech wasnt a thing yet...     &#x200B  I suppose its wrapping my head around that Clan Ferros not only mined Brackern for over a cenutry or so  but also Camille sort of usurped Viktors role as the Machine herald.

hm9arca,StarEaterShaddai,11/27/2021,1,359.0,The fact that player accounts rather than singular games are separated by region and cant play together is a testament to LoL divisions incompetence at infrastructure. 10 years ago I could get it but now its embarassing. Look at Dota 2. While accounts are bound to regions for the sake of the Steam store currency rate and top Immortal ranking(challenger equivalent) you can still party up with anyone and just choose in which region you want the lobby to be even having a display of latency values for each player. I know it would be unfair to compare Valve to Riot in terms of available funding and work force but lets not pretend that Riot is actually a s all indie company. The Riot client and Riot accounts really gave me hope but I guess its too soon.
hmc60wl,TeemoBestmo,11/27/2021,1,,it was never implied to be Ryze.  the fans just have hugely assumed that it is Ryze but that was the only appearance he made in the show so there is nothing that would imply it was ryze other than that he uses magic and ryze also uses magic.  heck we never even saw the guy except his hand.
hmbihrt,Vrathal,11/27/2021,1,1528.0,Its likely a bit of both in the game he only heals off a percentage of the damage done but not the full damage.  The CGI video seemed to follow that since he was hurt but didnt appear to be hurt as badly as he was prior to the reverse.

With a bit of luck you can get another Zilean ult in there after he got back with GA—before all the zombie modes need to happen.

hmbslvh,KogMawOfMortimidas,11/27/2021,1,341.0,Im honestly fine with the new Crown item people are just too used to freely blowing everyone up to stop and think for a moment that they need to drop the shield first before unloading their combo. A good change to slow the pace down while punishing monkey brain assassins who know nothing than free kills.  8.11 though we never got our stats and laning power back. Poke is now proportionally more of our hp than ever before making trading mostly just outright kills instead of chip damage. Supports hold all the power. No XP so always down levels. Its just rough. Even pro ADCs would rather climb on other roles than ADC with a random support that should be telling enough.

hmbp201,danny264,11/27/2021,1,,Getting a kill with pyke ult doubles the amount of gold it gives so if you can get a kill with ult you always want to go for it.

hma4s5z,clearlove777771,11/27/2021,1,29.0,people on reddit have literally insight into whats  going on in the eastern leagues but always have strong opinions on stuff thats based on pure speculation. as an example theres such a huge difference in how viper and nuguri integrated into LPL.

hm9l8qb,Esxos,11/27/2021,1,38.0,The music choices kicked me out of the mood entirely. Its not that the songs are bad or anything theyre great in their own right. They just didnt merge with the world at all. It was like the opposite of bebop where the entire world is basically jazz so the music is jazz. Feels like they wanted the show to resonate with this kind of pop music but didnt add the culture of it in the world itself so it felt disconnected.      The exception is jinxed but I think that one mostly fit cause it was playing from a radio and didnt take the spotlight from jinx herself when it was playing.     I dunno. Maybe its  the fact the show was so good it didnt need music with lyrics to support it.  Or it could because they put something nice (the music) next to something great (the rest of the show) making nice look meh by comparison.
hma01p2,LouiePyrex,11/27/2021,1,275.0,I’m a low elo support player that doesn’t care about climbing (in fact I don’t play ranked). I do have a nice winrate I play like a game or two a day with my gf but we started a losing streak. Can you give me some advice as a support?
hm98sfx,CreamyAlmond,11/27/2021,1,129.0,I mean because its not. Its some upgrades and few sidegrades over 2020.
hmcpjal,rmbar19,11/27/2021,1,,First who said anything about 10 seconds? I never mentioned a number in particular.  Second this is a related but seperate issue which I agree with. Damage overall should be lowered quite a bit.
hmcm87i,ltadori,11/27/2021,1,64.0,You made me log into Reddit just to tell you that youre one of the dumbest and most stupid mfer ive seen on this website during this entire year  So congrats and hopefully they remove the tumor rotting your brain

hmb9ynt,PixiCode,11/27/2021,1,52.0,You forgot characters who would center around Noxus and Ionia while still exploring parts of the world for one reason or another. Katarina is probably a big one? for Noxus. For Ionia it would probably be Yasuo due to his presence in marketing and his ability to wander around but Akali or Jhin would fit too.
hm8wnp8,Zylionx,11/27/2021,1,9.0,What’s the problem? Kayn is 2 Levels up with 111 Armor and tabi and like 2k gold more in item value. When is it suppose to be ever close?
hmb3otd,JedstarRomero17,11/27/2021,1,9.0,It seems like this player improved over their 800 games. Therefore they can likely achieve the same rank within 50 games on a new account.  You dont need shit ever when it comes to League. Many players use the new account technique and get pretty crazy results (Diamond in 100 games for example).
hm9knf1,rimidalv25,11/27/2021,1,1536.0,it will automatically release it after a 0.3s delay which is suboptimal (except for a specific combo)
hmcylp4,Yetti2Quick,11/27/2021,1,391.0,literally exactly what im trying to say. he spend his first 100 games learning champs and the role not really carrying just coinflip winning games. His meta knowledge is what wins him games low elo outside of that when he doesnt know the champ.
hm9n45v,Fast_Instruction_286,11/27/2021,1,21.0,It would not be hard to recognize these strategies as they are so few and far between and only on specific champs.  A 0/21 combines jng/bot/supp should not be allowed to tell me I cant leave.

hm9ksph,crownnn609,11/27/2021,1,5.0,Not sure how true heard karsa is trying to get him onto tes. I mean he’s better than anyone jkl played with
hmczfw9,Crivelo,11/27/2021,1,30.0,I think he would benefit a lot from having a pro player directly mentor him. His wave control and macro were poor and that can be helped a lot through mentorship.   He can always work on champ pool on his own time too
hmczbx5,PMMeRule34Pls,11/27/2021,1,33.0,No those are unattainable through crafting sadly. I have a few that are limited but none of those extremely old ones sadly.

hmbcj72,magem8,11/27/2021,1,40.0,i like it on zed alot because i suck at zed and spamming his ult makes him easier
hmaphfm,SP3EDI,11/27/2021,1,392.0,there is no need to blame anyone. Adam wanted to be malicious online in social media knowing he had the french fanbase to back him up. He tried to make it a top 10 anime betrayal post when it was not even upset that wanted him or nisqy to be gone. it was management that wanted to upgrade and replace him.  going online and trowing hate at other people especially in such a situation is more then disgusting from adam and his french fanbase.
hmasyh0,poggersinthechatttt,11/27/2021,1,15.0,Closest champ we have to being the definitive main character of Runeterra so yeah. I mean the guy runs around every region searching for World Runes while also befriending other champs along the way
hmcl44m,Drathyyy,11/27/2021,1,1.0,Get rid of it completely changes how the game is played unlike any other dragon. Not fun at all.

hmaolea,ScurvyWretchNA,11/27/2021,1,20.0,I remember playing with/against you when I was around D2 MMR bracket. Very great accomplishment man!  I remember watching you destroy an Aatrox one time and decided to try your build because I’ve been historically bad vs Aatrox on every champ I play.

hmd4v30,Worry7475,11/27/2021,1,127.0,That’s like a 25% increase for flyquest to be fair
hmb3dds,SaulJoker,11/27/2021,1,91.0,Why not both? That was the way it was before it got removed if they gated it to rank 3 I could see it being more balanced.
hmb80qr,TeeTheSame,11/27/2021,1,264.0,You stack it on the enemy frontline engaging your teammates. When its stacked it gives so much more access to the enemy priority targets helps to keep distance to melees and getting mages and other adc in range without putting yourself in danger. Ofc you still have to position correctly. Its not a braindead auto win but a massive advantage if used correctly. You will see it in pro play if it doesnt get changed until then.
hmaoczm,SP3EDI,11/27/2021,1,392.0,the drama that DL had to go through was affecting DL alone as a individual and he decided to stay strong. Upsets issue is about a living 3 party and the privacy of the 3 party goes before someone else. If it was something like Upset himself had depressions or what not then it would be more understanding to demand of him to speak to his teammates. in the case of a 3 party the team doesnt need to know what is going on.
hm9ojsg,Sktwin2k15,11/27/2021,1,11.0,I mostly spend that little time with friends yes but we have kinda split. I like tft some of em play aram (which is what we mostly play when we all play together) some play Ranked solo/duo and other play csgo. So we talk a lot in dc but hardly ever play together. But Im happy they still are at dc. Clash has been a travel back in time when we all played SR.

hmatkln,Angry---train,11/27/2021,1,170.0,>galeforce is pretty shit since it gets hard outscaled (unless youre burst oriented)  Galeforce is perfectly fineits just slightly more situational in comparison to Kraken  >wits end is extremely situational   Literally any semi on hit based ADC can viable use iteven if theres not a gigantic AP threat in the enemy team  >shieldbow is shit unless youre vayne or kog.  It works fine on a plethora of ADCs like ApheliosKalista and Dravenbut is simply more situational in the same vein as Galeforce   >LDR is shit because of the build path and that it just doesnt do enough damage most of the time. Check the stats on when its build second or third its horrid.    W h a t  The item is quite literally one of the strongest second items in terms of damage and has an insane scaling to boot.

hm9d4pv,dannyboyheinz,11/27/2021,1,27.0,And why would a company with that much revenue waste there money doing that? If youre paying someone to change the game it to either improve the game or to make money. The winter map was created to sell the winter/holiday skins. Those skin lines are dead. There is no point in spending money making a winter map.
hm9v6wd,SaulJoker,11/27/2021,1,22.0,What the fuck are you talking about?  My point is that if the OP was going to record the live game they should have just used OBS.  Your point is that they should just wait for the game to end and record it through the replay which is fine and I agree with but since OP chose to record the game live they clearly didn’t have that as an option at the time.  Again I hope you’re trolling me.

hm9ks7t,lppur3ps3,11/27/2021,1,15.0,It genuinely isnt. Excluding being in smurf queue any actual smurf plat + will have an easy time in silver.  Your personal 1 off experience means nothing compared to the plethora of other experiences saying otherwise.  Everyone knows its easier on a fresh account but you usually drop back down. Also I highly doubt the story in the first place not the whole idea just the fact youre playing against master players in solo q. Are you guys talking about flex? If so the whole post is pointless lmao

hmcvoag,DoomDuckXP,11/27/2021,1,93.0,I 100% agree with what you’re saying here but there are definitely some interesting historical examples of Singed’s reasoning.

hmb6h1e,Outfox3D,11/27/2021,1,264.0,Yeah theres a lot of people who used to use it who now have nothing. Its probably twitchs best rune still (maybe HoB?) which is just a travesty. It feels weird to use his ulti to wind it up but at least you come out the other side of the ulti with some extra range for your hurricain.

hm9lous,Ebobab2,11/27/2021,1,20.0,Youre thinking far too black and white there  Ranged champions have a far easier proc condition AND uptime due to the fact that they are ranged. Furthermore they get 100 range which in turn makes it even easier to keep the uptime up.   Then you are ignoring the fact that ranged champions can autoattack far more often than a melee one which in turn leads to melees wasting it vs ranged champions using it to the utmost efficiency
hmc37m2,zNYNz,11/27/2021,1,8.0,For ranked you need to own 20 champions (10 for bans 10 for picks) not including free rotation.  For draft you need 20 champions also for same reason but you can include free rotation so you dont necessary need to own all 20 if free rotation can get you there.
hmcnfpw,Litterjokeski,11/27/2021,1,255.0,Well but did you take scaling into that consideration?  For example team A goes full scale like kayle kog Janna corki and what ever jungler scales and the other team B goes full early/mid game comp... Now the early/mid team gets soul (maybe lucky steal last drake or so) but team A would win teamsfights just now because of scaling but wait now there is that super strong soul ....

hmbk3m2,thimo50,11/27/2021,1,303.0,>Vayne is benefiting from the objective bounty system thats why her winrate is increasing. She gets a lot of free gold from objective bounties that helps her survive mid-game.   Any stats on that? I just looked through every single bot match-up for vayne and no champ has a higher first tower time than her in any match-up. Its pretty hard to believe she consistently gets the first tower only has a slightly lower first kill ratio yet benefits that much from bounties so she benefits a lot from bounties while consistently getting the bot tower first?   I know bounties also depend on farm and kills and so on but there is no way LT doesnt play a big role in her WR spike. Just look at the different WR based on runes. LT has a way higher WR than PTA.

hmay5uz,stuffslols,11/27/2021,1,14.0,Why do we need more mana items? Mana .anagement is an important skill and allowing you to circumvent that with items is not a great idea. Better to just change the tear items scaling or better yet leave it there so it can simply be only a bonus to its stats that doesnt change. Its always the same. Nothing wrong with that

hmcreoi,Aced_By_Chasey,11/27/2021,1,456.0,Its moreso your arguments are purely from saying your teammates do well with it I dont even think youve said youve tried it haha. The best Yasuos in the world dont like it but its w/e.  Again you have no argument outside of anecdotal evidence and said the ad from conq isnt that much dmg. That alone says you arent very good.
hmab0bb,OilOfOlaz,11/27/2021,1,313.0,> However the usual jobs people have is not as emotional close with your colleagues as being a League pro player so Id imagine it is really hard having to build a sort of brotherhood to get on the same page get to know each other and trust and then somebody isnt trusting you (even with a family matter) also just moments before the biggest moment of the year for the players.  I kinda get your angle here but former players often described (old) SKT as a well oiled cold machine in game with ppl not being super close to eachother the same has for example been true for the real Madrid squad that won 3 CL in succession or the 90 Bulls who threepeated twice. On the other hand there are Teams like the 2008 Celtics where ppl (exept Ray) still stick up for eachother more then a decade later and also 2009-2011 Barca where the core guys constantly shower eachother with praise and never said a bad word about eachother.  There are different teams dynamics and they can work in different ways I mean its obvious that some players demandes sth from other players that they were not ready/able to provide and in the end it boils down to trust Upset didnt trust Adam that they would keep the uinfrmation private Adam didnt trust Upset when he said that it is an important matter both are in the same boat here essentially.
hm95eg3,Bilisticbiscuit,11/27/2021,1,63.0,I think its a pretty good guess that this insanity potion is some kind of improved shimmer. From arcane we can see shimmer has some huge effects on people once it wears off. Its kinda a stretch but since singed suffers no negative effect after using his ult i think you could reasonably say he’s iterated on shimmer in some way and without silco’s marketing decided just to call it insanity potion. I doubt signed was the one pushing shimmer in zaun so why would he care if the name is good or not.
hmb4xv7,henluwu,11/27/2021,1,30.0,nothing stops the guy with 3 pots from buying refillable too after basing costs him 150g for the 3 pots which is almost exactly the same as a wave (minus xp). If you can get away with it refillable is better but its too risky for most ppl since early game is so important.

hmcissz,BeezerTwelveIV,11/27/2021,1,440.0,I mean Ryze/Tryn are the champs representing the two co-founders I’d Riot. I don’t know who Jax represents but in the lore it’s all but confirmed he the guy who is “runs/owns” the actual League and is so so bad ass he can’t use a weapon per his own restriction. But then you have people like A Sol who conjure whole ducking galaxies? So I mean idk. Just play the game I guess and think of it how you want
hm8usot,daddymateriial,11/27/2021,1,18.0,Ive played top for the last 10 years its not easy to switch. And I dont know mid lane matchups while I know all the top matchups so its a comfort thing. If I put the time into learning the matchups mid lane I probably would.

hmch5jv,ralanr,11/27/2021,1,293.0,One thing I really wish league could do more is have the map change around a bit aesthetically. It’d be neat to have a city or map based around another area of Runeterra outside of a game mode.   Guess that’s what the mmo is for.

hmaksqg,SaulJoker,11/27/2021,1,23.0,No but they removed it completely which means they didn’t want it once he hit levels 11 or 16 either. They could have easily make the mechanic only come online at 2nd or 3rd rank of ult.
hmabsa4,Am_I_Stuttering,11/27/2021,1,13.0,Team Chat isnt useful tbh most people dont ping let alone call out and when someone actually does mean something useful it is a ping thats not muted by settings unless you do it on the scoreboard.  Level 200+ appear in your game cause they arr so bad after playing so much or playing with smurfs on their alts that are your level
hm99uir,Voshin,11/27/2021,1,6.0,Hate speech definitely a problem. But it also depends what you consider as hate speech nowadays everything can be seen as hate speech it seems even tho it can simply be speech you hate (the 2 are different). If what you reported to Riot is this one screenshot how is it hate speech? We have no context. Maybe he was drawing a conclusion based on what hes seen not necessarily promoting it. Maybe he was saying that as a *unfortunately* racism always wins with the unfortunately implied. We have no clue since we have no background.   Anyway yes its a problem not everything you dont like is hate speech.

You get that split second where you can see them before its disabled.  Cant recall it ever working differently other than back in the days when sweeper was a ground target instead of locked on your champion.  &#x200B  Also works the same when I use my sweeper - I use it walk onto a warded area the ward lights up for .25s-.5s still active and deactivates after that short buffer period.

Michelangelo Da Vinci Van Gogh Shakespeare... What you can artists I would call merely the road-builders the forebearers... They established the traditions that Arcane would one day perfect.

hmaff5q,Twjohns96,11/27/2021,1,6.0,What role are you?  Game thinks you’re playing above where your rank actually is. You need to go on win streaks to change it.  I was getting 16 a win and losing 12-14- loss in gold and 20 something a win in silver.  I’m in plat now and I’m in the same situation as you with a 55% WR. But ever since I hit plat I havnt really gone on any winstreaks so until I play better the game isn’t going to let me climb. Truly just staying a float winning 1 losing 1 or losing 2- 3 in a row then winning a couple.  Currently reviewing my games seeing what I can do better to get climbing again. It’s called MMR. A lot of games have it. They implement it to keep the skill levels the same at certain ranks so people who are dominating don’t spend too much time with people who’s skill capped at that rank.  LoL is weird in that a plat player will absolutely 1v9 a bronze silver game especially if they are playing JG/ mid. So you really don’t want people too much higher or lower than your rank in your games cus they can absolutely ruin the game.
hm9lb3q,TH3RM4L33,11/27/2021,1,230.0,It also happens on melee Q but melee Q going on cooldown when it hits its fine - its problem is that it goes on cooldown before the cast is completed too. Ranged Q however has no cast time so it should go on cooldown only once (in the moment it was used).

hm9deo2,Atheist-Gods,11/27/2021,1,215.0,Ive documented some Seraphine bugs but was unaware whether they were on Riots radar:  1) Q will sometimes pass through targets without damaging them when they are walking towards the center. This is not just the standard weird hitboxes and even happens against targets in the exact middle of a fairly large AoE. I assume that its due to a bug with the hit detection on the wave where a target can walk from outside the expanding circle to inside without being seen as a hit  2) Her echo passive can sometimes be canceled without going off likely due to inputting another action at the exact right time. It tends to happen when I am spamming a followup attack or spell.  These both occur fairly regularly. I would estimate that I notice the first happening 2-3 times per game and the 2nd every other game.   Clip of Q bug: https://streamable.com/s6sf67   The first Q does 0 damage to the left melee minion and front ranged minion both of whom are within the hitbox as shown by how the right ranged minion is even further away on the 2nd Q but still gets hit.

hmauw8x,gothsole,11/27/2021,1,2.0,the replays you can view in client are only valid for the patch theyre played on sadly  the best way to permanently save replays is to record them via something like OBS. its not perfect - you dont get all the spectator controls you normally have - but its good for saving highlights or rewatching your games later to look for things you can improve on
hmae8fv,SP3EDI,11/27/2021,1,,it was communicated. But they demanded to know the specific reasons what the management could not give them because it would go against german laws to do that without upsets direct approval.

Winning lane 5/0 doesnt mean jack shit if you have 1 dragon to their 4 and they get Shelly.  3. Dont KDA chase. If you hard win a teamfight and two assholes escape dont run them down through their jungle. Fucking do Baron god dammit.  4. Only play 3-4 champs at maximum in ranked. Only play off-role if filled and you dont want to dodge. Norms exist for a fucking reason.  5. Buy control wards and use them at objectives or to guard important resources. If you have 75+gold after your buy and you dont have a control ward youre inting.

hmcin91,CreativeAd481,11/27/2021,1,22.0,If we use real world logic Id have to say Sett is heavily favored without gauntlets. Hes a good fighter and Vi just doesnt have the size or strength to match him. Looking at their physiques its pretty clear to me that Sett has almost a hundred pounds on her. Normally these gigantic size differences can be made up for with grappling/wrestling but in a straight boxing match I dont see Vi taking more than a few hits before just straight up going down.   With fantasy logic though where strength isnt necessarily correlated with body type I think it could go either way. Id slightly give it to Sett still though since he has way more fighting experience than Vi and likely against stronger fighters too in a more formal setting. He also is probably much better at grappling and wrestling than Vi.  With the gauntlets I think Vi just hits too hard and too fast especially with the shielding that the Gauntlets give too.

hm9yx0e,Dage-The-Ninja,11/27/2021,1,53.0,It feels like they balanced it for late game 5v5 team fights.  Stacking what seems like more than needed stats on melee so they can get it stacked and be useful.  And very little on marksmen because its basically inevitable to get it late game. Though a big portion of its strength is the added range the uncapping of attack speed is huge for some marksmen. It used to only be windowed in the old LT for 3 to 6 seconds. Now its uncapped as long as youre attacking. You can build AS on marksmen without fear of overcapping or wasting a steroid in your kit.

People who hate riot dont hate riot because of their music or their content its because they get frustrated with the gameplay loop theyre in and begin to hate it.

hmbmyry,GiventoWanderlust,11/27/2021,1,12.0,Thats because the ratings arent how badass was your KDA its how well did you play compared to other people at your rank.

Runaan has some specific rules like for Vaynes on hit not being able to be triggered by it while Runaan do apply on hit effects.   About the concern I doubt the enemy ADC will try to attack your ADC when youre between the twos as a Darius or a Nasus. This just focus the adc sounds more like a meme to me than anything else when adressed to adcs.

You hear their shouting and struggling and it might even annoy you every now and then but at the end of the day youre so influential and powerful early compared to them it mostly doesnt bother you.  You also get to feel proud if your kids and be like  I made you when they get fed late.  If anything I think junglers are just toxic parents.

The chances of this happening (if Ive done my maths right) is about 0.00005311.   Usually in gacha games a grid like that means literally nothing. Most of the time its just there for visual appeal and to give you the idea that i have a 1/9 chance to hit the grand prize it shouldnt be that hard when in reality the prizes have a set percentage of you getting them with of course the biggest prize having a very low chance to get.    Unless you mean a 9 by 9 grid then its quite possible to not hit the grand prize.     Also garena has full power over league on servers they own.

hm96p1v,Trinitati,11/27/2021,1,42.0,It does. The reason why it appears otherwise is because the ability that drops aggro also does damage ***after*** the untargetability ends (e.g. Fizz E Yi Q etc)  e.g. if you dont autoattack after Camille R (which doesnt do damage on its own) the tower should just go back to minion targetting.
hmcxuoc,StarGaurdianBard,11/27/2021,1,65.0,We have streamers who stream themselves running it down/insulting people/griefing people too that dont get banned/take forever to get banned. Its because Riot seems to not take action based on streams or YouTube videos and only take action when they actually get reported in the client. But Riot has 100% said on multiple occasions that custom skins are bannable. Will you actually get banned? Probably not. But they are all banned because of the skins that can give unfair advantages and Riot not being able to tell if you are using Train Sett vs Sett with his W range indicator always faintly in front of him

hm90lwz,dannyboyheinz,11/27/2021,1,13.0,Theyre dying because they suck. Sure I can TP bot and help them but if I dont get a kill (trying to gank a lane with 2 fed champs isnt exactly free) I will lose my entire advantage topside. TPing bot means my lane opponent will take tower plates and catch up in CS. Or they take Rift and snowball. TPing bot prior to 14 minutes as a champ other than Shen has been extremely risky for a while now.
hmbhb6g,LumiRhino,11/27/2021,1,111.0,Even from the first game that they won you could tell their mentality. Spica was just like pick me Olaf even though hes shit.
hmbu06n,Toxic_Fkin_Noob,11/27/2021,1,45.0,Heres my thoughts on the Singed is Oriannas father fan theory:   Until its officially confirmed I refuse to believe that Singed is Oriannas father. Just like I refused to believe that Silco was going to be Singed despite that being the prevailing fan theory before the release of Arcane. Not every little thing needs to be a tie-in to some other champion that level of plot-convenience would be awful. I think it would make both Singed and Oriannas lore worse for them to be connected like that. I really dont want Singed to be Corin Reveck I want Singed to be Singed.

hmbacro,Outfox3D,11/27/2021,1,264.0,I mean ... yes and no. Yes if you could start the game teamfighting it would be a significantly stronger rune but it gives you a laughably small amount of power in lane. Theres nothing to wind up on no easy access to the range steroid for short trades and it doesnt give you enough of a combat steroid to compete in an all-in scenario.   Even in a teamfight no its terrible on Twitch - who spends long periods out of combat repositioning and usually wants a swift burst of damage during his ulti. He doesnt use the rune well. And Trista ... well its an alright choice but shell never part with Hail of Blades as long as it remains strong. Also while her steroid is huge her base AS is low and she wouldnt wind up the rune all that fast (or benefit as much from the bonus AS it offers - but no one really does) even with her Q up.  Also I dont even think the rune is the best choice in a true front to back. PTA is a stronger steroid if you dont need the extra range. Its a rune for the weird hybrid case where you want to start in a front to back and then pivot mid fight (without leaving combat) to a non-front to back. Or I guess it assumes you kill their tank before they kill yours ... but with a worse tank-busting rune? Its just so weird and niche and IMO the ideal situation for the rune doesnt hsppen often enough in game ro justify it in a game where you could pick a laning rune and just carry a lead.

hm9ig1o,FabioSxO,11/27/2021,1,252.0,I am master and Ive played most roles as well I understand that you might think that jungle is the easiest because of how hard it can carry when fed but support is no way easier than jungle or mid or top or adc. Theres no fucking way. You are simply not used to how support is played because it can not just right click and oneshot like other roles would. About Top yes when I smurf I find it harder to carry on Top even if its my main role and thats why I prefer playing other roles.  Top>Ad>Mid>Jg/Support  This tier list is only correct from a smurfing standpoint. How much impact can X role have when 1v9ing every game. Same as yours but without support being the hardest because it simply isnt and is only different from what youre used to.

hmc0xke,xpxpx,11/27/2021,1,,The season 8 ADC changes still mald the hell out of me sometimes. The role basically got gutted entirely. Lower early game stats and power then lower late game damage and reliability and people still tried to justify it because ADC was sooooo over powered even though mid had always been the best role until like season 7 when jungle and support started to gain a lot more power and freedom. Probably my least favourite period playing the game since beta.

hmc8mkj,Policeman333,11/27/2021,1,277.0,You know what really doesnt matter at all? As in doesnt even matter slightly to players?   Map terrain changes because of dragons. Its boring as shit and the trade off isnt worth it for what players lose.   If you were to run a poll and ask what players wanted  * A. Festive map changes (Winter Chinese New Year New Year Halloween Summer Fall Worlds etc)  * B. The map changes in COOL and WICKED ways because of the DRAGON (epic!)  Festive map changes would win by a land slide.   Like if you were to bet money on it you could be confident that 90%+ of players would vote for festive map changes even if the ***only*** festive map change they promised was the winter map.   >not wanting to commit dev time  Map terrain changes are a waste of dev time and a misallocation of dev time to a feature that the super majority of players would gladly give up.  They are working on shit that players dont care for.   >You aren’t entitled to a winter themed summoners rift.  Players are entitled to whatever the fuck they want out of a video game. Devs arent entitled to vanity projects that only serve as looking good on a resume at the sacrifice of player wants.  The entire company was founded on the philosophy of players first and devs not being boneheaded.

hmbklza,RaiseYourDongersOP,11/27/2021,1,113.0,Even if he had good stats no one was rating him top 3 mid. Hes middle of the pack. Either way Im not trying to say ABO is shit just that looking at the teams DLs team is the weakest at least from what I can tell.  Team DL: Doublelift middle of the pack LCS mid soloQ star top (no idea how it will translate to something like this) Academy jungler academy support who was shit in LCS and one DL has critiqued a lot lol   Team CoreJJ: Dont even really need to say much here CoreJJ and Bwipo already make this the best team. Armao isnt really that good imo but he has a lot of experience.   Team Blaber: Blaber mid who has LCS experience Danny (rising adc talent) Zeyzal who has a lot of LCS experience   Team Spica: Dhokla (LCS experience) Spica Tactical not sure about the rest of them. I guess you could maybe argue this team is the worst but I think strong jungle/strong adc/experienced top is better than inexperienced top/decent mid/strong adc/meh support imo. It could be different though obviously because I dont really know the players from Academy and the other young players.
hm9hi4l,THEDumbasscus,11/27/2021,1,4458.0,Remember game 4 of that exact series when Wunder got first blooded level 1 and then had to have jankos sit on his lane (not clear Krugs next to him but explicitly sit under his tower with him) for 3 consecutive waves causing Jankos to finally recall at level 4 as Bwipo was clearing the camp that would get him level 6? Because I do and it was so funny.  Upset was better than rekkles that day. Wunder’s consistent need to call for resources in order to not even win lane just continue existing in lane cost fnatic so much more than upset being a better right clicker than rekkles

Combining magic and chemical compunds = chemtech.  Its an advanced application of magic. I dunno why youre so stuck on it being foundational when it was never deemed as such. Theres no naturally occuring tech trees that you can cut the tech branches off to make the tech plating for your hextech revolver. Just not how it works.

hmafvs4,Frakcherd,11/27/2021,1,1845.0,Its not hard to dodge a punch when youre concentrating on the person in front of you. Also a lot of his blocks and dodges were him just interposing the shaft of the hammer between himself and the Chemtanks which is an intuitive method of blocking with a large weapon.
hmbafkq,LezBeHonestHere_,11/27/2021,1,264.0,And lets also completely disregard the 6 auto attacks you need to do before you even get the 100 range. Its a nice effect if you live long enough to proc it lol.
hm999le,LoLrovex,11/27/2021,1,236.0,Ezreal felt the best since you didnt really need a team to do dps or farm while Aphelios should be the 1v9 champion but felt the opposite since it was so team reliant.

hmbrqsk,Applepowdersnow,11/27/2021,1,3.0,Hairdresser here!  hair grows around 12cm per year for around 7 years before it falls out naturally (changes a little from person to person). so there is a natural cap to how long ones hair can be.  but im not sure how that works in the world of runeterra or if maybe the fumes in the air changed how her hair grew over time.  &#x200B  how she keeps it clean?  back in the day people didnt wash their hair as often as we do today also because of the lack of fresh water etc. they´d wash it once a month up to once a week. they would comb it out twice a day and keep it braided or in updos. combing the hair twice a day thoroughly spreads the natural oils from the scalp down over the complete lengh of the hair. keeping it from drying out and keeping the small skin parts from building up on the scalp.  &#x200B  id say for jinx it would be similar. id guess she washes it once a week and braids it every day after combing thoroughly.
hmc10ot,_keeBo,11/27/2021,1,55.0,> Singed being evil  Singed isnt evil he just doesnt really believe in ethics. Everything is a science experiment to him and he doesnt value life in the same way we do. He would willingly kill someone if it meant he can progress his knowledge or keep his experiment running.

hmcpmmh,MrMonday11235,11/27/2021,1,490.0,> On the other hand it diminishes every other character in the game  Only if youre entirely humourless. The characters lore is/was joke and so long as he doesnt actually appear in any important stories to beat the shit out of the BBEG with a lamppost it can stay that way.  We have a gigantic dragon responsible for creating entire galaxies getting 1v1ed by one knife girl spinning really fast and you think the existence of Jax is the issue?

I remember seeing their stream highlights back then and they would already use it. So I assumed that Riot just allowed it everywhere since its not fair to ban smth from 1 group while allowing it in another.

hmaghch,shaidyn,11/27/2021,1,17.0,A lot of players cant carry but they can play safe. This is me.  The worse your team is the worse this playstyle is because theres a low likelihood that anyone on your team will carry.  But if you have a team of better players and all you do is not feed you have a much higher chance to be carried.

They should have had a Korean speaker there to help with the cultural differences from day one.  Dont put it on Doinb his job is a player not a translator or a host.    The whole team especially Tian seemed stressed as hell why dont they have a psychologist talking to them regularly?  The whole vibe from that team seemed like it was all on the players and they won despite the management team around them.

hmd29db,Quazifuji,11/27/2021,1,569.0,If I had to guess what the next TV show would be it would be the Noxus/Ionia War with Irelia being the main character on the Ionia side.  Arcane even has a nice natural way to set it up: Season 2 could include Mama Madarda recruiting Singed for Noxus then the Noxus/Ionia show could have Singed poisoning Yi and Rivens villages triggering their origin stories (Riven seems like a likely candidate for a major character in a Noxus show).
hm9thwx,TH3RM4L33,11/27/2021,1,242.0,Im not talking about projectiles being dodged thats completely different. Talons Q has no projectiles nor does it act like one. Im talking about the cast being cancelled aka the little animation that lasts 0.25 seconds before the ability actually does its effect (dealing damage dashing shooting projectiles etc). If Veigars R cast (NOT THE PROJECTILE FLYING) would be cancelled by lets say stealth it wouldnt go on cooldown because it only goes on cooldown if the cast successfully goes through.  A better comparasion would be KhaZixs Q this ability is exactly the same as Talons melee Q but since its coded properly it doesnt go on cooldown when cancelled.

hmd90iw,Moon_Breaker,11/27/2021,1,6.0,They handled it by killing other main characters.  Theyre telling the story of characters that we already know the future for.  They cant just kill them off along the way due to that fact.   &#x200B  If you were watching it from a viewpoint of someone who doesnt know the game/its champions then you got to see plenty of Main characters die throughout the show.  Its only because we play the game that we get that bias of okay these are the main characters - Several who were built up as key components of the show died along the way.  &#x200B  They become the champions we have today by surviving all of the nonsense not by dying along the way.

hmc2342,Liy010,11/27/2021,1,261.0,I think the choice of using dragon is more for competitive integrity. It allows Riot to introduce new buffs/souls without introducing new models and hitboxes. Say if a player who always clicks on the wings of the dragon to smite well now those new creatures dont have wings and you have to adjust to it.
hm9f9c7,Mixed_not_swirled,11/27/2021,1,372.0,I feel bad for you. As a gamer in Siberia you will never have good or even decent ping because of the vast landscape being so sparsely populated. There wont be a server there and any server will be far away or in Chinese/Korean.

hmbw1xd,Xonra,11/27/2021,1,221.0,Funny enough that is not threat enough for Ryze. He is more specifically trying to collect the beeg magic runes so others dont abuse them. There are actually quite a few people or things on the planet that could easily stop Viego if they really wanted to they just dont want to or dont feel the need to.  More than a few champions for example are far stronger in the lore than they might be assumed from their gameplay. Ignoring stuff like A Sol as he isnt really planetary.
hmb85w7,Distinger_,11/27/2021,1,125.0,The chemtech shoul should be reworked completely it’s just absurdly broken and unfair on many levels.  It does not make any fucking sense that every fight becomes a 5v10. The enemies could even let one person perma split and they would still be fighting as 5v8 taking towers for free while also winning teamfights or taking objectives.  It is already obnoxious when one fed person in the enemy team builds GA now imagine if every person has a free revive with no cooldown that’s what this bullshit soul is. And now imagine if on top of having chemtech soul they also build GA or have champions that revive like Sion Karthus Zilean etc. You end up with a fucking mess of a game.  Not only it is an almost certain won game for the team that got the soul but it’s also a very toxic mechanic that should not exist. (Yes this includes Akshan’s revive. It should be reworked into giving the extra gold from it’s passive to the avenged allies).  Either completely rework the soul or at least give more debuffs to the revived like not being able to apply omnivamp/lifesteal or use summoners/items and ffs give it a cooldown of at least 3 minutes.

hma45l7,Dastu24,11/27/2021,1,16.0,We are playing flex atm and the enemies againts us are up to masters in soloq in contrast to g3 we max faced before.   And yes you can have easy time in silver if you play champ that can carry or jngl for example.  The first time i got into gold in solo around 40 games in i swear i lost 25games in a row out of which 20 were afk ppl and i dont like you i will feed sure you can carry some of those but the difference between this and what we play now is insane. And yes difference is solo and flex but that also mean we sometimes face full 5 ppl squad and are still able to defeat them.  And as i said being stuck in silver i wouldnt thought i could do better but now playing g1 games these are the best games and experience i had in a long time. Actual enjoyable games with ppl who knows what they are doing (mostly).   And in the end winrate speaks for itself.

hmc9j7m,rmbar19,11/27/2021,1,212.0,**when I watch him play hes almost always raging at teammates**  Probably at least part of the issue. A lot of my friends that are stuck in bronze are *very* blamey. They say they want to climb they care about their rank but dont ever criticize themselves opting to find something else-usually teammates sometimes matchup whatever. Theres probably not a single game out there even by pros that is 100% perfect-everyone makes mistakes. First step is to acknowledge this and find your own mistakes. You cant improve if you dont actively seek them out and try to rectify them.

hmc7yg4,VeroMars33,11/27/2021,1,65.0,It’s good to starts with champions with shields or cc then if you want to be helpful to team.   Personally I would say Annie because:  1- she has a good shield that gives movement speed too and can be cast on allies and yourself  2 - has a lot of damage that is easy to land (point and click as well as AOE)   3 - her passive gives you a very free stun every fifth ability which can be used with any of your damaging abilities - Q W and R  4- her Ult summons a big teddy bear called Tibbers that can run enemies down frontline for you or your team soak damage and abilities in a fight and you can control Tibbers. So you can sit behind and use him. He also keeps attacking even after you die.  5- when you’re learning she can be played in any lane  Tip: you can get a huge engage or a huge play by stacking your passive cc and using your Ult on top of a group of enemies. This will stun all of them and deal a lot of damage as well as allow for Tibbers to act as a frontline of sorts.
hmaawum,The-Meido,11/27/2021,1,101.0,Seasoned Summoners Rift (Like the Winter map) or even just map skins announcers etc. Theres a lot they could do. But the soul from Riot feels like it is literally gone. Id be willing to even pay for stuff like this just so that it feels refreshing once in a while. Nevermind that though heres a debonair skinline.   For the map skins in general there was a small group of modders who literally made an entire [Bilgewater themed map](https://youtu.be/VONVBp2y0PY?t=97) including minions. Goes to show that sometimes a dedicated community puts more effort into things like this than the actual company itself.
hma7pts,TheBestCCIsDeath,11/27/2021,1,189.0,First off you only get to speak for yourself and second I main the champion isnt an excuse for it being garbage.
hmatt7k,trapsinplace,11/27/2021,1,,Selling stuff to Chinese players isnt opposed to a winter map though. Other guy says business is booming and China is business but that doesnt explain why stuff like winter map cant exist.  If Riot were to sell map skins theyd likely turn China into an even bigger source of revenue alongside everyone else. Riot can sell just about anything and make boatloads of money. I dont see how business doing well in China relates to stuff like map skina though. It makes sense for champions and gameplay changes because those are what really keeps people in the game. But stuff like map skins? Emotes? No reason these are limited by a Chinese playerbase.  Business is booming all over for Riot and their lack of cosmetic features after all this time just makes no sense. Compared to DotAs cosmetics Riot is more than a decade old and compared to other non-moba games theyre still years behind. None of this is due to China players or revenue. If anything it should be done BECAUSE of Chinese revenue.

If one team is ahead enough that the _other_ team needs soul especially chemtech to put an even fight then the team that was ahead missplayed (read: failed to push their advantage/failed to prevent the soul/failed to close the game).  If the missplay is big enough it may cost that team the game.

hmbfo8i,KosViik,11/27/2021,1,303.0,> but getting 100 range is so massive.  The thing is you need 6 autos to get that range increase.  If you did 6 autos to someone and the range really starts to matter then something is off.  You either wouldve attack moved him down anyway -> range doesnt really matter. Or by the time you get 6 autos off your Assassin/Mage/Tank will one-shot whoever it is anyway (the teamfight will likely be long decided by then). Or by the time you get 6 autos off the enemy Assassin/Mage/Tank will fart on you and one shot you.  Honestly the only stable use for it is annoying people in lane with Caitlyn as such early on people arent repeatedly one-shot so she has time to get the stacks...
hmcrjrr,Inside_Explorer,11/27/2021,1,116.0,Support item stats are always skewed which doesnt mean much. Theyre the most inflated items out of any class when it comes to win rates because supports dont get much gold therefore most of the completed support items have higher win rates than what other class items have.  Generally if a second item doesnt have close to a 55% win rate its just a terrible item to buy second period. Most games end at a couple of items and especially as a support who doesnt get as much gold if your second purchase is a 50% win rate item that is just a terrible option to buy.  Whats even more telling when it comes to Axiom Arc on Pyke is that not only is it his highest win rate item as a second purchase its also his most bought item at that point in time.  Often with different champions you see that their most popular choices might not always have the highest win rates and theres lesser picked options that are much better.  But with Axiom Arc its literally Pykes most bought second item and all the other less bought options also have lower win rates theres no winning here and its a pretty clear case with him.  Obviously Axiom Arc on Pyke is a win more item thats probably why its so good. The extra gold you get from that ultimate towards your team outweighs all the other things you could get from a different item.  Because Pyke shares gold with his team its not just a matter of Get an extra kill steal but youre literally giving your team more gold which is hard to make up with any of the utility from the other items.  Theres a lot of other champions people overvalue Axiom Arc on as a second purchase (Nocturne Qiyana etc) but Pyke is clearly an exception where its genuinely just good.  For Pyke you should be looking to get the other lethality items (Umbral Glaive Ghostblade Edge of Night etc) as a third purchase instead because their win rates at that point are much better whereas Axiom Arc only grows a couple of percent from second to third purchase.
hmb41zi,00Dandy,11/27/2021,1,34.0,I generally dislike all the negativity surrounding this game. I know it has become a meme but many people are serious when they say League is a bad game.  And it often seems like saying League is a good game is a controversial opinion in this sub. Which is so strange when you consider that League is the most popular online game on the planet.   I think many people just cant handle losing or competitive environments in general so they blame their frustrations on the game (or their teammates).   I play LoL since 2015 and I love it honestly. I also watch a lot of LoL esports.

If you tell the captain that you need to leave give him enough details that he gives you the green light and even encourages you to go and then you even tell the owner of the ship WHY you had to leave and they deem it justifiable why the fuck would the crewmates also need to know? Especially when one of them is a teenager you met 3 months ago.  If the captain and owner of the ship tell the rest of the crewmates that the 5th crewmate really had to leave and they still dont believe it theyre just being insubordinate and disrespecting the captain and owner

hmc5xpf,Inside_Explorer,11/27/2021,1,,If you look at sites such as lolalytics it shows that Axiom Arc is the best 2nd item for Pyke support as well though.  Umbral Glaive only has around a 50% win rate as a second item which is terrible whereas Axiom Arc is the highest win rate second item for him.  I think that Axiom Arcs power is exaggerated heavily in this sub and the item is over purchased on champions its not very good for and under purchased on champions that should be using it but for Pyke specifically it seems like its genuinely just a good item.  I thought that it would be terrible on Pyke as well because he already has a resetting ultimate but looking at lolalytics the stats clearly just say otherwise.  If you play 50 games of Pyke and purchase Axiom Arc as a second item youre just automatically going to win more games than if you went for a different item instead.

hmajzh4,jenokop,11/27/2021,1,115.0,I think Riot did a good change on the new lethal tempo. The rune split stats gained between raNged and melee. So when the rune become overpowered or weak for some champs it can be adjusted without effect BOTH ranged and melee champs.
hmakghn,FranticDisembowel,11/27/2021,1,38.0,That said I asked the U.GG team if they were planning to add timers to their app because I vastly prefer it to the Blitz app in every way except the lack of timers. They got back to me and said they were in talks with Riot because it was unclear whether or not jungle timers break the ToS and it seemed like Riot might address it very soon.  So I think Blitz might be taking a shoot first ask questions later approach. Or it was allowed when they added the feature but Riot might be backtracking.  Or maybe U.GG is just being overly cautious and they will add it later once Riot gives the go-ahead.

hmc9665,SocialistScissors,11/27/2021,1,10.0,Gonna try to give you some playstyle variety with my recommendations so that you can find ones you like. These might not be the 3 easiest champions per role but should be relatively new player friendly while giving you some variety in terms of options.  Top: Jax Malphite Dr. Mundo/Garen (Garen is slightly easier but mundo is better.)  Jungle: Warwick Master Yi Nunu & Willump  Mid: Lux Fizz Yone? (note: Yone is difficult but his kit is extremely low elo skewed and he is broken below high elo.)  Bot: Ashe Miss Fortune Ziggs.  Sup: Lux (again) Yuumi Blitzcrank

hm95l1c,edgelordweeb_,11/27/2021,1,30.0,They probably wont be able to upgrade support. Rumors said RA may have been looking at selling Hang but that shit is not gonna be cheap at all. Thats gonna be a fucking massive buyout. If they cant get Hang their best option available is gonna be to keep Zhuo which honestly isnt that bad anyways. Zhuo is solid and super young. Im operating under the assumption that Missing does NOT one of the players leaving if the rumor of a couple WE players leaving is true. If Missing leaves then that could be a pretty hype signing for TES.

hmc3z1i,Illokonereum,11/27/2021,1,261.0,I can’t stress this enough but riot does not give a shit about league of legends as a game. They’re here for league as a franchise. That’s why all the effort goes towards other stuff now and league itself is just a skin shop.

hm9akst,InRoyal,11/27/2021,1,,Yeah by 1 place I Think you know what he is trying to say. He is not arguing if he is better than anyone at the top. He is arguing that he is still one of the better midlaners and would place him in the good-decent caregory of midlaners which he can be even if he is worse than half the midlaners. But if you wanna be technically accurate you are right it just isnt really the point he is trying to argue.

hmcx19t,JoshQuest1,11/27/2021,1,31.0,I like to ramble so unimportant things are spoiler tagged for your convenience of not needing to read it to understand whats going on. :)  >!Paddle Star (Q1) send the star 800 in any direction. You can recast it (Q2) to send it towards a direction and it will go (2500 units/second) until it reaches 800 units away from Zoe.   Portal Jump (R) lets you blink up to 575 units away but after a 0.25 cast timer unit then youre just rooted and (disarmed & silenced) for 0.75 seconds.<!    You used to be able to Q1 Q2 then R to reach 2175 units away fairly quickly. >!(If the missile speed is to believed a little more than a second accounting for reactivating the spell.)!<    In 7.24b >!(AND apparently 8.1)!< they changed the mechanic a little so that no longer works as consistently.   It used to be Zoe would update her position for the purposes of Paddle Star (Q2) at the start of the cast time for Portal Jump (R) but it was changed to the end of the cast time.    It felt really fluid and nice and only in looking at the wiki for this did I realize how they changed it and it makes sense but it still feels bad.     You can still pull it off but it pretty much has to be right as you hit Q2 as that missile is going to reach 800 units away in .64 seconds and you have .25 seconds where it wont work so you have .39 seconds of wiggle room to make it happen.  >!But it also looks like in 8.1 they made the change again Now takes longer to register her new position (for purposes of calculating damage) when casting Portal Jump.   Which reads like if you hit the (much harder now but still possible) QQR combo it wont do its full 1600 range damage?

hmc2gr9,e_zzzz,11/27/2021,1,52.0,Not many changes impacted the jungle much outside of nerfed crab just means that you don’t have to int for them and just adapt your route as per usual. I think the biggest difference between low diamond and high diamond jungles is the ability to recognize risk vs rewards and adaptability. The best jungles right now are gankers or predator users (and maybe lethal tempo) and their roles are still roughly the same as last season. No major changes outside of crab which you can easily adapt to. But it really depends on the champ you play but overall junglers are still extremely reliable overall

hmaznwl,Amsement,11/27/2021,1,222.0,I wish youd try using your brain and see why teams dont want to sign Jensen. Youve provided literally 0 actual context to anything youve claimed but call me lazy how ironic.   Stats without context dont tell you anything meaningful and what do the stats in this infographic actually tell you about Jensens performance this year. You can watch his games and see he didnt perform to the standard people have for him and in regards to LS you can literally watch the videos on his youtube where he comments on Jensen. Ive linked 2 or 3 and you still insist on saying LS said this or that without backing up any of your claims.  Ill explain this for like the third time now. Spending a shit ton of money to buyout Jensen and pay his salary is not worth it for most of these teams. It doesnt guarantee them an LCS trophy nor does it guarantee them a deep run at worlds. If his price was more reasonable/maybe if he was a FA his situation would be different. If youre so confident you know better than these teams then provide some actual context to your claims.

Just slap it on from December 15th thru January 15th. Would be fun.  It is a shame though that they also stopped coming out with winter skins. I feel like they never truly thought about all the awesome skins they could release and for what characters. Candykayn for example.

hma4wrc,SovereignType,11/27/2021,1,13.0,The game is just bad... Riot are obsessed with damage and aggression and making the game into Fornite with quick boring matches and the same overpowered champions. I always tell my friends not to play it unless they are edgy teenagers that want to lash out because their parents told them to clean their room.  Arcane is also a way for Riot to distract people from their numerous sexual harassment lawsuits coming down the pipeline.

hmbbog1,ItsThatChrisDandy,11/27/2021,1,263.0,Gonna be honest I absolutely love Lethal Tempoe on On-hit Varus.   Doing 4 shots/second in lategame is absolutely hilarious and people dont expect the DPS.
hmbmx2f,_gr1m,11/27/2021,1,7.0,Yes exactly. I used to dominate the early game and basically render enemy jungle useless since my playstyle is super aggressive and I tend to get red and then directly steal blue and frog. So Id say with confidence that probably 90% of the games I have won the early game for my team since theyre left to farm gank-free for at least the first 6 to 7 minutes. 10 if I manage to catch the jungle on the spot and I almost never lost first blood. And that changed for me too. Seems like most of the jungle options either had a base stat buff or something because I ALWAYS used to out damage the likes of Viego Diana Gragas and Yi.    Now Im like a minion compared to them in 1v1 with just jungle item

He takes way too long to stack it the old lethal was better for him in a lot of cases.   And that applies even more since other toplaners take lethal aswell and stack it faster than him (notably tops with AA resets or AS steroids).  Jax Sett WW Yone Xin and Trundle would be better examples.

hma27na,Fast_Instruction_286,11/27/2021,1,47.0,No its not a fucking good comparison it would be a slightly better but still shit comparison if it had been about criminals/mentally handicapped being able to vote.  I am not saying average players shouldnt get to vote Im saying hard feeders shouldnt.

I know the basics but am pretty lost on most details like runes itemisation and all the new champs. Any good ressources to bring me up to speed?

hmcmuw8,Rechulas,11/27/2021,1,,> I assume that the mining of Brackern is just as old  Itd have to be a little old at the time since the gems were already in Benzos shop meaning they had to have been mined already and found their way to Benzo and since Benzos shop seems like a small uneventful place that probably means they were in circulation for a while  >And it seems that Caitlyn is like 30ish with her visual/voice updates   Caitlyn only reads as older because shes just very adult for her age she shows this in her mannerisms and actions shes like 24 or something but Camille is definitely super old by this time yeah. Brackern were definitely mined for a while prior to Hextech but how effectively other people even attempted to utilize their power isnt really stated.

(Well easy if youre someone who can do sfx type of makeup to begin with...)

I wouldnt say the look is all due to editing theres a lot of makeup at the base of it all!

hm9okhv,WeirdChamp960,11/27/2021,1,21.0,Wrong. Just undeniably wrong. I play Fiora a lot and often times dont participate in fights at all. I drag 2 people to my lane absorb pressure and while they take wave I farm their jgl and pressure the next lane. There are games where I hardly fight but still absorb a shit ton of pressure.   And dont tell me its not a viable strategy. I played it up to Plat 2 with a very decent winrate.
hmd4yzx,saruthesage,11/27/2021,1,127.0,Not necessarily. Doublelift talked about how he didn’t want to join a weaker team and was already making a massive amount streaming. Jensen maybe but even then he can just wait for Summer and if one of the other teams doesn’t work out (C9 TSM EG) he can join them for good money instead. And a “pay cut” likely still involved salaries in the mid-high 100000s. By any way you look at it that roster is not going to come cheap.

Feel free to invade after your first 3 camps since hes so resilient Youre giving first blood if you run into any jungler. Every motherfucker is full hp BESIDES THE GUY WHO DOESNT  FIGHT THE FUCKING JUNGLE. If you start red when you place your fourth passive your fucking oom almost and put of hp.  What you claim is straight just not fucking true the only thing that is is his ability to steal camps as long as you have smite your investment to take someone elses blue buff is 2~seconds.
hmcmea2,SocialistScissors,11/27/2021,1,,Bronze 3. Could probably have hit atleast silver if I didnt ragequeue all my progress away. I had a 100% winrate on Vayne across 6 games until I got tilted because I got a super toxic support mid and jungle (still managed to win that game for 7W0L). Lost the next 5 because I was tilted out of my mind from that one game.
hm8yzuw,AppropriateBeing8,11/27/2021,1,579.0,I just came back to the game got to diamond in 4 days on a fresh account but i was consistently teamed with very bad players (48-52% winrate) whereas the enemy team would be stuck with players with +65% like myself. Needless to say that continued for like 15 games and my winrate crashed so hard. Anyone else had this?
hmaecxo,Liteboyy,11/27/2021,1,79.0,That’s kinda crazy to be on a team like FPX and just decide they aren’t good enough to win worlds so you just chill in top island. Lmfao.

If youre a bursty AD caster then you want lethality over the omnivamp.  And also I think its just really easy from a champion design standpoint to slap an AA steroid onto what otherwise wouldve been a squishy DPS AD caster kit and then suddenly the champion is just an ADC and is building bloodthirster/shieldbow instead of ravenous hydra.

hmay770,100WattCrusader,11/27/2021,1,65.0,Everyone trying to justify that it’s suppose to win game is ignoring the point of the post.   Yes souls are suppose to help win you games but not auto win and not be entirely unfun as well.   Statistically this soul is far overpowered. 3% above the second best and 5% above the third best. It does need a cooldown or a nerf. Hell all the old souls have had cooldowns essentially so that makes the most sense really.

hmboyyd,MorningRaven,11/27/2021,1,3.0,Honestly I loved all of these (really surprised they didnt bring Nexus Siege back. It already uses Rift as a set up). I hate playing pretty much any of the ones they actually give us now and would trade any of them (even urf) for the chance to play these again.  I can certainly see why Odyssey is winning. The augments were creative and fun and a PvE gamemode is so needed. Though the game mode really burnt me out on hearing odyssey skin sound effects. Having 5 Yasuos all throwing out 8 tornados at a time does that to you (I do miss Missile Trail Jinx though. Shes fun as a caster). And the meta pretty quickly made sure you had Yasuo and Jinx and might not even need Malph Ziggs or Sona.  But that overkill is why I preferred Star Guardian Invasion. You were capped at one person per champion with 10 champs to pick from instead of 6 repeating. The missions were also a lot of fun trying to make unique teamcomps like beating the mode without using marksmen or the only support you could use was Poppy as a tank no enchanters. You could get really creative with real builds from League to make it work. Like having someone else do crit or mages focus on a burn dps build. Or Athenes allowing you to heal those you shield and that allowed enchanter Lux to support when you couldnt have Lulu Janna or Soraka.  Im still waiting for those void invader skins. *Riot*. Let me melt my enemies with the Velkoz laser reminiscent of those from that damn hallway I spent so much time in.

hmcl3tr,Odd_Play_5769,11/27/2021,1,65.0,I think ADC feels great overall with q few issues. We have 3 great mythics and I build all 3 situational and many other ADCs do. We might have the best and most balanced mythics overall between classes.  Our Legendaries are where the options end: its LDR 2nd IE 3rd or youre trolling. If youre fed and snowballing you can sometimes buy Collector. And honestly most games dont even go to 4 items so it doesnt really matter after that. Even if it did most of the Zeal items suck. The only one I build is PD and thats only occasionally if Im on Jinx or Kogmaw or something.

hma1yvp,outthawazoo,11/27/2021,1,21.0,I think the only time the music *didnt* work was whenever it was Imagine Dragons. Every other scene with music whether it was original score or any of the great pieces created by other artists they were all incredibly well done. So many scenes were elevated from good to phenomenal because of music choices. The Ekko vs Jinx scene is one of the greatest thing Ive ever seen and the music was *perfect* for it.

He was probably the closest person to Nuguri in China and he went above and beyond for him. Crisp and Doinb have also said that they quite liked the FPX management. I think the issues with Tian and Nuguri are way more nuanced than what we can see.

Hauntzer and Sven would probably not even be top 5 in their roles and last time DL played botlane was the weakest point of his team. Jensen would need to carry hard.

For example Ziggs gets a ton of skins despite not being a popular enough champ to get top sales notches.  It just so happens that hes got a kit/model thats easy to make really good quality skins for and see their concepts best realized.
hm916vq,BloodiedSmile,11/27/2021,1,11.0,Oh :(      Kinda disappointed I didnt find a cool easter-egg story thing. Thanks for figuring it out though.
hmal795,MoonDawg2,11/27/2021,1,,It was shit if you were good at adc and knew how to poke pre-fights.   Old lethal had too much CD and conq was actually better on most situations on jinx until it was nerfed. New lethal is miles better for her if youre good at the role.
hmb7ef7,TeeTheSame,11/27/2021,1,264.0,In a front to back teamfight you start stacking it on the enemy frontline and after you stacked it you have a much easier access to priority targets thanks to the range. Thats how adc teamfighting works. Its super rare for you to hit priority targets from the get go in a fight. Obviously it synergizes well with other AS buffs like Kraken and PD to get the stack going and on champs with AS steroids like Trist and Twitch.
hma5v4v,frumfram,11/27/2021,1,147.0,I honestly think people who just dont think it through think this way  I brought this tragedy up vaguely earlier in defense of Upsets decision keep it private (goes without saying but hopefully Upsets close ones dont have similar or comparable situation)  Think it this way:  You have a number of friends and family you are essentially okay any and every one of your friends and family sharing any private matter in your life to people who are strangers to you because your friends or family work closely with these other people you know nothing about but you are okay them sharing your private matters to these people who are strangers to you because they have this team bond(?)  I get that pro players barely have any privacy anyway living in gaming houses and whatnot but this isnt matter of their own privacy but their close ones who probably dont know much about these teammates or what kind of people they are and they should be okay with these strangers knowing anything about them  I dont buy it I legit think some people just arent thinking this through
hmb0y31,MoonDawg2,11/27/2021,1,,I have its usually not much of an issue because galeforce falls off so hard. Galeforce is there to just burst squishies if you dont fall on that category you shouldnt have an issue. Just ignore them and eat their frontline like juggernauts are meant to do.  Btw your champ has a bug that doubles its E range after flash if done correctly. Sett is the one that struggles the least against galeforce
hma3lpd,mattiejj,11/27/2021,1,372.0,Its pretty common here to have the radio on in the office.
hmb4xwl,Hadonski,11/27/2021,1,206.0,I never said that the game should be balanced around higher elos did I? I simply said that in higher elos its below 50%wr. People usually refer to whats meta by looking at higher elos and pro play. So I just wanted to take that into context too when talking about viability of the rune.

hmbmr3o,WhereAreDosDroidekas,11/27/2021,1,588.0,That was between the creation of the hex gate and the present. Given those are engineering marvels they probably took years of design and production to build. Heimer is kind of a stickler for procedure.

hma8xc7,Samsonkoek,11/27/2021,1,,Yeah I totally get you dont want to share everything. But from what we the community have heard from the other players on FNC it looks like the other players didnt even know in the slighest what happend. Then again Upset said he did mention there was stuff going on so I dont know...  However the usual jobs people have is not as emotional close with your colleagues as being a League pro player so Id imagine it is really hard having to build a sort of brotherhood to get on the same page get to know each other and trust and then somebody isnt trusting you (even with a family matter) also just moments before the biggest moment of the year for the players.

hmahpl0,fnlbss,11/27/2021,1,12401.0,You dont get it. There is no jinx/powder dichotomy.  The idea that shes two different people is something she made up just like every other schizo thing shes made up in her head. What Jinx sees throughout the series is completely independent of who she is at the time and not even the color of her eyes played into her freak-out moments which was probably on purpose like most things in this series were because her eyes change color constantly.  The only true cardinal rule behind Jinxs insanity is that \*shes insane\* and theres not much more to it. The shimmer didnt change anything for the good or worse.  Her actions before taking it were no different than her actions after if anything shes just faster/stronger  This really wasnt the case in Parts 1&2 and really makes the bridge scene in part 3 just feel like a serious last minute mess. Her seeing caitlyn smiling at her was one of the most off things for her character in the series. It just doesnt make sense to whats been presented and only reinforces the fact that shes just crazy. Its not ptsd or triggered by anything. Shes just batshit insane. Shes also completely fine with killing littleman who she used it be best friends with.      She 1000% would have shot silco off shimmer.
hmctygf,higherbrow,11/27/2021,1,43.0,Jensen wasnt great domestically last year either. He had a good Worlds and Id still bet hed be top half of the league  but that team would be the definition of veterans slipping towards washed up that the community always claims to hate.
hmbplby,tageeboy,11/27/2021,1,588.0,You are very correct. Ive always heard about League of Legends when Im checking on gaming news but never paid any attention as Im into a very focused game type. Keep in mind Im old so that may taint my view. But I saw the show on Netflix when it was released and LOVED IT! told everyone at work how great it was. For the first time ever I watched some LoL twitch play the other day and it made sense. I had a general understanding of what the different teams were about. I plan to give it a try during the Xmas time off I take each year. Dont get me wrong I know absolutely nothing beyond the show but it caught my interest and made me want to try it out. I cant be alone.
hmag1ec,Random_Stealth_Ward,11/27/2021,1,,> I agree with how stupidly easy itd make the Vanguards apply it. Though ADCs can also apply it very easily (3 aas with Mortal Reminder ?).  Yeah but consider it like this: mortal reminder only applies the 60% if you hit them with the three autos. This means the first two autos arent going to have the 60% GW applied and you actually apply the effect on a lower area of effect when it does triggers.   > Then how about just keeping the first condition of 40% and adding a 50% max HP threshold like Morello or Chempunk instead of the CC condition.  If it replaced the cc condition it would likely be a nerf to tanks as it would go back to only applying if you are getting attacked Which would give you less control of how to apply it and its not like tanks are really capable of getting a ton of Champions to 50% HP maybe even probably a nerf to bruisers too. Its basically a well if a ton of jueggernauts cant apply lets make tons of other champs not apply it situation. If it was just added as a bonus it potentially could be too strong but i am not too sure... It probably would be fine  I wouldnt be surprised if the 60% against half HP enemies was actually used in the first iterations before new thorn came but An important factor to consider about thornmail is that its basically the lowest interaction GW. Making the 60% GW tied to the user being active with it (inmobilizing an enemy) rather than passive is probably the way to give it more interaction and some better control in how to apply it when dealing with enemies that dont autoattack as much.

hmbr2nh,be_like_neo,11/27/2021,1,19.0,Dodging and afk penalty has nothing to do with griefers... At all. Its 100% because of the fact that accounts are so easy to buy. Theyre only 3 dollars. I have around 20 smurfs and I definitely will grief some games then switch to a different account if it gets penalized. A lot of people do the same as well.  Riot just needs to make accounts verified by cell phone so that if you get a penalty on one account it affects all accounts with that number. Or they just need to do a much better job at shutting down botted accounts. Thats it. Until then this game will always have toxic players. Also the leaver penalty is extremely lenient. Id be actually amazed if someone hit the 14 day penalty. I can leave 3 games in a row and all Ill have is a 5 minute wait in between games.
hm90v6j,PM_something_German,11/27/2021,1,328.0,Yep Estonia wouldnt be much better for Russian players.

hmd64ev,PLMessiah,11/27/2021,1,127.0,It works both ways though. It can be argued that teams like CLG Golden Guardians etc. would not have lasted in the league and been pushed out of the League. It opens the door for more competition to not be placed in last place.
hma26qa,Dmienduerst,11/27/2021,1,,Sorry never been a hip hop guy and it comes through occasionally.  I didnt mean it that hip hop was the problem more comparing it to the original post saying pop songs were the issue.  Enemy is fine and if the band wasnt animated in the scene it works for it.    As for the Ekko scene I agree with you everything about that works and the music is a big piece.  Heck even the weird shoulder shrug from Jinx works because that character just is insanity personified.  Its one of many examples in arcane where the scene animation and music all are produced to complement the other 2.
hm902ud,WintersEnvoy,11/27/2021,1,13.0,Youre not in a position to get 1000 gold kill shutdowns either yet youll see them now and then because people are missplaying

hmd0y2o,Crivelo,11/27/2021,1,,Pretty sure he crashed wave on 2 in the first two games. That removed the possibility for a dive in game 1 and resulted in him getting solo killed in game 2.   The fact is he doesn’t have great wave control
hmd7gfx,heypenda,11/27/2021,1,39.0,thank you so much i really appreciate this :) im sorry that it happened to you as well and you stopped playing but im also glad that you found a way to go around this! thank you again and i will try to stay strong like you too :)
hm97a12,brokerZIP,11/27/2021,1,,Slayers are divided into assasins and skirmishers. And everyone you listed in first sentence are skirmishers including Lillia. Yes she is a skirmisher because shes not tanky and has good mobility to be a juggernaut. AND she cant be mage/battlemage because of her low range (E doesnt count due to high cooldown not to mention that you max E last on her).Yet she has sustained damage with dot and low cd low range ability AND she has a heal. Shes clearly a skirmisher

hmaz4ld,LoLrovex,11/27/2021,1,341.0,The whole being mia pinged is a tricky one. If youre doing the right thing then you just need to mute the person for example you gank enemy top and wave isnt fully crashed. You will need to push it out for them or they will tp and freeze so in that case we just go with the right play. If you cant finish games you need to be rotating objectives earlier and forcing enemy to fight you drake is a great win con especially in lower ranks.
hma2bxa,Flambian,11/27/2021,1,26.0,To be fair old Mundos R cost 25 percent current health while Current Mundos R regains 15-25 percent missing health as bonus hp which feeds into the over time percent max health healing
hm9lhp4,TheFlattestStanley,11/27/2021,1,7.0,I have played this game since season 5 and have never ffed a game even when we are 0 kills to 30. You queue up to play a game you damn well finish the game. If you want to play a game where you always win dont play league.

Which is fine i would rather a late  second season of similar quality than a trash one released quickly.   I am hopeful it lives up to the hype of the first.
hm9i4cw,L2Hiku,11/27/2021,1,81.0,Qiyana is unplayable too. How can there be a bug that makes it so her q literally does no damage when it hits something every other time. Unless they fixed it by now.   Also elementist lux portrait icon when she has a skin on like water or fire resets to her base skin portrait after she dies. This sucks cus its my favorite part of the skin. :/ But atleast its not gameplay effecting.

hm9f1is,Dastu24,11/27/2021,1,13.0,But as you can see me playing and trying to improve got me stuck for several years the moment the player i played with often not even me had to get new acc we started to climb rapidly out of nowhere playing basically the same. (I still think that biggest problem being stuck in silver is 35% games you win 35% games you lose and 30% just somebody throwing/afk/trolling and so on only question is will you be on the lucky side)
hmbfogm,happygreenturtle,11/27/2021,1,111.0,While it is an example of playing non-soloQ League playing in TCS is not really the same thing as playing inhouses with pros and academy players.   People used TCS as an example that Tyler would do well if he played in LCS xd

hmby8qr,RemoteAnalysis3809,11/27/2021,1,236.0,A Chinese PRIVATE COMPANY owns Riot Games.   Yes you can say the Chinese government ultimately has veto power over every companies in China but saying the Chinese government owns LOL is like saying the US government owns McDonalds. Just because McDonalds headquater is placed in the US it pays tax to the US government on a yearly basis and follow local laws doesnt mean the CEO is literally  Joe Biden. Same with Riot Games and China.  Also the capitalistic idea of Riot not doing the map because it doesnt turn a profit and yet at the same time get run by a government just dont make sense.

hmd35ld,dimitri0610,11/27/2021,1,4.0,Sometimes extra health wont really help much. For example vayne does true dmg based upon max health as a percentage. So no matter how much HP you stack shes going to take out the same relative chunk each time with her w.   See the description: Every third consecutive attack or ability against an enemy deals an additional 4/6.5/9/11.5/14% of the enemys maximum health as true damage (no less than 50/65/80/95/110).  Here you could consider building shielding of some sort to help soak up some of the dmg from when her w chunks you.

Vander went toe to toe with the Shimmer monster which would buy more than enough time for them to escape. I think thats the real tragedy. They mightve actually escaped and in trying to help them she actually doomed them.

hmbq9hw,JoeMartBarsik,11/27/2021,1,156.0,No I dont believe so but I think both Ryze and Shen have hinted to a main character in the Runeterra universe.  Ryze is looking for someone who has the ability to let go for Ryze can not keep collecting and safeguarding the World runes as his time is coming to an end.  Shen is looking for a student who will follow the ways of Balance every student of his fails this task but there is someone out there.  With the Void brewing to make their first move Targon scheming plans and Noxus planning more warfare between Ionia it is only a matter of time before this character shows up.   My guess is that this character will be the Invoker to League of Legends and be able to use World Runes.
hmc7w14,knockemdead8,11/27/2021,1,406.0,LT feels really solid on Caitlyn now. Her range is obviously really long anyway but with the extra hundred tacked on she can attack you from half of a lane away. It feels a lot better than most of the runes that have been ran on her.
hmcere8,BuilderHarm,11/27/2021,1,178.0,Heres a funny bug that happened today: had the Chem soul as KogMaw and died was resurrected died again entered passive blew up and was alive *again*. Was able to move and everything. When the enemy killed me in this state it did not grant gold.  It was too short to see if it had an effect on my death timer.

hm9jkw5,Piegan,11/27/2021,1,33.0,Nah no search its a preset set of images and the software edits them based on the keywords you provide. I dont have the link anymore but there was a similar post in the WoW subreddit I think not so long ago with a link to the original pictures pre-morphing. If it was generated from 0 it would be very impressive but if you put the Original & the Edit side by side you can tell theyre the same picture.
hmal4ye,Unfair-Combination51,11/27/2021,1,4.0,Next time there is even buy the pass (usually 10 or 15 bucks).... grind out the event currency and then spend a ton of it ( or all of it) on random champion shards.
hma8b0t,GA_Deathstalker,11/27/2021,1,145.0,A lot of young people here reacting (and yes I count DL as young aswell). No just because youre an athlete youre privacy doesnt go out of the window. Maybe theres a big difference between the German and the American attitude but this whole drama is NOT about UPSETS PRIVACY its about the privacy of a THIRD PARTY that he doesnt want to reveal. And if thats anything then thats god damn commendable!
hma5a2z,w23333,11/27/2021,1,147.0,Yes but an appeal to authority isn’t bad a fallacious appeal to authority is bad. For instance saying “I think the vaccine is fine because the scientific community seems it as safe” is an appeal to authority but it’s viable.  But if you say “I think the vaccine is fine because Doublelift thinks so” is a fallacious appeal to authority. Doublelift has no expertise in that area
hmcu4df,TechnalityPulse,11/27/2021,1,3.0,I mean infernal soul and hextech soul have pretty massive ramifications on the rift.  Ocean soul also has pretty big effect on the game.  But Ive never felt a soul so completely remove the utility of wards from a game before. Like trinkets and green wards are literally useless. Pinks are the only thing to place in Chemtech soul zones but they dont get obscured by chemtech soul where you could place them in bushes to obscure vision otherwise.  Its really strange how all of these souls warp the game but chemtech warps on a level that is just unfun and counterintuitive.

hm9s8hu,Dmienduerst,11/27/2021,1,15.0,Ya but then the ekko vs jinx scene i think completely works despite using a hip hop track.  The difference?  They didnt have imagine dragons as in world characters it was ekko vs jinx.  Sting has done pop music to and his song is fantastically used.    Its more dont put a music video in your very serious show without the main characters being the lead role in the scene.

hmaaal1,Going2chang3,11/27/2021,1,12395.0,I said in another post. If they had made s1 with 3 more episodes detailing the resolution to this. Then made the next season an anthology story showing the world of Runeterra feeling the ripple effects of hextech and Zauns claim to freedom it wouldve been goated. But it sure feels like theyre going to focus on Z/P and I feel itll lose its punch. And its primarily because of how they pulled the ending theyve lost my trust. They clearly dont trust their own writing to give a satisfying ending and have that want to come back they have to tease what happens next!?!? To do it and that turns me off of a show so fast.

hm9spk3,Shiesu,11/27/2021,1,266.0,Uh yes it makes sense that a good player gets through low elo. Anyone who can get a high MMR account to master can get a fresh account to master. It just takes longer. People have this insanely illogical idea that somehow its harder to get out of low elo than to climb among the top 0.1%.

hmc4nyf,Ononoki,11/27/2021,1,214.0,And my point is if your team is behind and the opp gets all 4 drakes its very much fair for it to be a buff to help them win the game. You want to lose the early game lose the mid game and then stall for 40 min to 6 items win 1 team fight and win. What if opp has a early game oriented team? How is that fair? Do they just have to accept that they got outscaled? Why cant you accept that they get to win with the drake buff?

hm9k3qe,LustRuru,11/27/2021,1,47.0,It’s not Tencent it’s China not celebrating Christmas Chinese playerbase makes them money that’s why we keep getting dragon lunar skins 5 times a year  What we should be upset and angry about instead is Riot making hextech and chem „ELEMENTAL“ dragons - instead of a frozen one for a all year round snowy map
hmb4gku,SergioMaia111,11/27/2021,1,30.0,Meh she seems pretty chill. Plus she has so many apparent flaws in her kit that we can easily punish. When playing adc laning with a zyra support is really difficult because she is very selfish her plants can and will push the wave and steal cs and kills. Her plants provide additional gold to the enemy team when killing them and none of her abilities are defensive abilities so you really can’t peel for your adc. In my experience seeing a zyra being played never goes well the adc either gets really mad and quits or rages or she feeds… She was better on the earlier years of league right now she is still a dangerous pick. I know she is doing good for herself right now but it’s still a dice roll whenever we pick her.

hmd045k,EdAY_,11/27/2021,1,209.0,Yep that is true. Though I feel like it’s another case blown out of proportionality—it is an internal issue. Though I can’t really comment because drama happens all the time and you get two set of rabid fans doing rabid fans stuff. But there’s a theory that this (escalating the drama surrounding FPX through arguing fans) is deliberately done by the “capital” behind the match fixing that Bo have been exposed to take part in as revenge against FPX for well bringing attention to the match fixing an alternative view is that the “capital” did it to divert attention away from the match fixing scandal. Though it’s just theories I’ve heard so take them with a grain of salt.

hma4zk2,MorningRaven,11/27/2021,1,13.0,I know theres always plenty to complain about but objectively speaking League is a good game by a lot of standards. The online multiplayer toxicity is mainly the reason people are told not to play.
hmbry3i,YongDragon,11/27/2021,1,599.0,Its interesting to see this cosplay. Its so good. When I compare it with Jinx it seems off and I think thats because the blues are a different hue and Jinx physically is hard to match as shes excessively lean and has sharp bones. When you look at how hard it is to cosplay Jinx and look at this level of detail it really speaks a lot on the cosplayers skills.

hma4xg8,WintersEnvoy,11/27/2021,1,13.0,League toxicity is a meme it was spammed by anti league (e.g a lot of disgrunted dota players at the time) and the league community was young in the early days like 13-15 of age for the large part     Now league players are probably above 20 on average and despite reddit sentiment trolling and afking is quite rare. Most certainly more rare than peak overwatch where people would swap to a bad character as soon they lost a point. (maybe with their role queue its better now) Im not even sure where you get this community is trying to scare away new players from did you see like 2 reddit posts that were negative compared to the 3 dozen posts telling everyone to be super friendly to these new players since Arcane came out? Maybe the toxicity was the negativity inside us all along.

hmd5v02,shaneuwu,11/27/2021,1,64.0,actually i’m pretty sure it’s canon that katarina has some magical properties as in - her blinks in game are actually teleports in the lore. also apparently setts W is canon. you’re also underestimating his half vastaya side a LOT. sevika survived in arcane even after all the punches she took from jayces gauntlets by vi so while current day vi would probably have learnt a bit more while being in the wardens she still wouldnt have anything on sett.

If the app works the way the other commenter mentioned (Im not familiar with it) it would absolutely be possible to get snow and sand from just Freljord and Shurima with no additional input if the AI simply does an internet search for related terms. From official Riot stories alone I imagine there are plenty of occurrences of the words snow and sand with Freljord and Shurima respectively

But she *was* getting there.  As I said before well probably get this expanded in season 2.  Edit  Actually no we got a sex scene between Jayce and a new character in season one.  We damn well better get this expanded in season 2.

hmalcph,Outfox3D,11/27/2021,1,,Kalista and Ashe are best case users IMO: able to stick to a target want to take an exteded trade after dont need the extra laning power that could be granted by another rune but benefit from the range and AS granted by Tempo.  Vayne is a solid user but she sacrifices laning power for it and her single-target-at-a-time approach favors PTAs damage amp. It (PTA) performs better overall and just feels great in laning.  Jinx is another good choice - and late game the extra range helps her out quite a bit and gives a boost to hurricane. She doesnt get a lot of use out of it in lane but with the loss of old LT and with Conqueror being meh on ranged she doesnt have a another option. Its worth noting that with a bit more power in stats itll be probably be her best-in-slot but wouldnt be if old LT still existed.  I dont actually know if Aphelios can wind it up with severum Q but if he can hed likely be alright with it though PTA offers much stronger laning.  And lastly Kog. For the same reasons as Jinx but he might have trouble keeping it up when BaB is down. Theres abposaibiliry of some form of Navori build opwning this up for him but Tempo really sosant give enough AS by its lonesome to fuel the AD heavy build.  A more generic Caitlyn build might like it in the late game though with HoB cheese just now disappearing and new mechanics on the horizon its impossible to say what her rune setup will be. Tweaking the ASUs mechanics changes means shes too in flux to judge but its likely shell have trouble sticking enoigh to activate it without a tank to wind up on ... at which point PTA is better at busting.   Things like Tristana and Kaisa wont use it as long as HoB exists and synergizes much better with their trade pattern (once youre all-in you dont really need extra ranfe over extra stats). Once Xayah stops being lethality (if xayah stops being lethality) shell likely use HoB or Fleet over Tempo since it just doesnt give good stats she wants and doesnt enable the same wave control it used to. Her trades are really just extended burst windows and while a feather combo can lock soemone down to wind up youre out of steam after you burn through clean cuts so always on isnt necessary. Theres no way Lucian or MF drops PTA in their crit builds.

Theres a difference between communicating and going into details. Upset has communicated. You want him to communicate details. To quote [IWDs tweet](https://twitter.com/IWDominateLoL/status/1464623024548847621):  > Upset informed his organization and his coach about the details of his family issue (who both confirmed the severity of it).  If people want further information it just means they don’t trust Yamato/Fnatic and want to make their own judgement on the legitimacy of the situation.  ____________________________________   > Oh and they arent allowed to be angry because upset is still playign victim for him being a dick.  No one is saying they are not allowed to be mad. However Im not sure if the solution to being mad is to cause more harassment in the direction of the person youre mad at. If I were mad and you were to send other people over to harass me that is not going to make me want to disclose details to you.  > If you are still emotional - get the FUCK off the team and take an extended break.  Would you look at that the offseason a period of multiple months where they are not playing together (as much). Almost resembles something like an extended break huh?

hmco5fn,PepelaTeaTime,11/27/2021,1,64.0,I thought Wukong was supposed to celebrate the Chinese servers.   I almost feel like Serpahine was shoe-horned to be this rising pop star champion just because they wanted to implement a Chinese pop figure in KDA for Worlds 2020 that was hosted in Shanghai and ultimately to appease the home fans.  She almost felt too rushed along with her kit. It explains why her Runeterra lore is so trash and the public reception of her was so atrocious. Riot needs to learn that appeasing anyone will result in a low quality product and that Studio Fortiche is king (KDA #1 MV was far superior to #2).

hmap4ws,Dan5000,11/27/2021,1,129.0,yea i thought about that myself but if riot was introducing that id think thats lame think of something new. i liked a few other ideas a bit more. mostly breakable walls. how about changing almost every wall to be breakable but depending on how thick they are they need longer to break. so you can easily break through the back of dragonpit but some walls are way too big to even try and attempt it unless you want to hide in your semibroken wall or some shit. but it always has to still feel like league.. dunno how much would be too much. being faster on ice in the river should definitely be backed up by something more^^

hm9bj4y,WintersEnvoy,11/27/2021,1,9.0,This is such a huge misunderstanding of comparing the roles impact to raw difference in player skill. A support can impact other lanes yes (mostly midlane top roams are less common than once per game not very realistic or consistent). And they can absolutely turn lanes around especially if more than once (doomed for an evenly matched mid who gets 2 vs 0 roams)     On the whole turn it into a kill lane thats just pure skill diff through and through you cant pull that shit in elos where supports arent brain damaged turds. But yes any dia player can spam brand in gold and win a ton of games much more EASILY than offroling other roles they also dont know. It doesnt stem from supp impact just that its so easy to offrole it and also the chance to win a lane for 2 players very easily which was already my point support is easy to offrole thats the only reason its easy to climb especially lower elos where support skill levels are genuinely poor (compared to other roles).   &#x200B  But this doesnt mean a support has actual more impact than a top or mid does on their own lanes or than jungler does. Thats nonsensical. A support roaming 4 mAYBE 5 times in a game vs one who does 0 or 3 bad/pointless ones is basically a 5v4 game. If the enemy support is sitting bot because theyre yuumi or whatever or just passively playing an enchanter or velkoz who roams poorly for w/e reason (or into an enemy corki/liss mid or whatever) and theyre not near 100 % freezing enemy adc off exp then theyre missplaying your teams support is only hard carrying because the enemy support is brain damaged (or maybe the enemy adc obviously a support cant solo freeze if their adc shoves in).  Furthermore yeah if an adc knows a support who roams at wrong times and lets the enemy bot 2v1 your adc for more than 30 seconds at a time has to get shit done I couldnt tell you how many games you see supports abanadon incredibly easy 2v2 lanes so that the adc ends up dying once twice three times because 1v2 laning for more than a single wave is very difficult if your supports gone 2 minutes that better be minimum 1 kill probably not even worth just one depending on whats happening botlane. And in the cases supports are doing normal roams (like when youre supposed to shoved and recall or lane gank mid into going back bot etc) then supports dont even have remotely the same impact as jungle/mid/tops do because they only get those shots like 2-3 times per game for most games.  Support being a super strong role in soloq is a serious misconception stemming from like aftershock nonsense 2018 its a role that has been objectively very nerfed the last 3 years in everything from rune choices to champs to items. Supports look so strong because they dominate laning phase for botlane and also get to roam. But its an illusion for actual strength in soloq winning botlane doesnt impact games that much unless youre turbo 0/10ing them by end of laning phase. Ganking in laning phase \*can\* have huge impact on the overall game state but the vast majority of games it doesnt actually have that impact its just tit for tat generally playing for counterganking or punishing overcommited fights by playing from out of vision. Roaming 3 minutes flat during a game and achieving 2 assists is probably a failure (unless its like turned kills so you save one and kill one as opposed to just getting a free kill in an already won lane) because you shaft your adc so hard and without extended roam periods youre only looking at a miniscule amout of ganks throughout laning phases most of which will achieve nothing because its so easy to predict them at obvious recall points. Supports helping with invades is also super situational which requires winning botlane matchups on top of good wave situations vision info jgl and mid matchups.

hmbfzbp,Rias-senpai,11/27/2021,1,303.0,Severum does not stack LT.  Kog is far weaker in lane because of the LT changes. Before it was possible to trade aggressively with pre-proccing LT and walking up with BaB + tempo. Now youre essentially fighting without a rune since Kog loses most extended trades without Lulu and hes never been good at burst trades pre 6.
hmatmq9,reverent-girl,11/27/2021,1,67.0,Udyr isnt even particularly good at this. It sounds like you just got super far behind.

hm9w0wi,Joatorino,11/27/2021,1,36.0,Where exactly did they mention they wanted it to make it better for ad carries? I swear ad players think they are the center of the universe. They just wanted to make the rune better in general and make it more appealing for everyone. You dont like it? Awesome go pta instead. Or fleet. Or hail of blades. If conqueror is not a bruiser rune then lethal tempo is not a marksman rune either

hmalkog,goblin0100,11/27/2021,1,,Bruh she is literally a Kumiho and her name is Korean...  >The Kumiho (구미호) or Gumiho* is a nine-tailed fox spirit. In Korean tradition foxes that have lived for a thousand years accumulating a great deal of energy turn into Kumiho.  >The Kumiho has the supernatural ability of transforming into a human—usually a beautiful woman. Though able to shape-shift there is still something quintessentially fox-like about a Kumiho even in human form. A Kumiho in human form might have foxy features pointed ears hidden beneath flowing locks or nine tails that only become evident when a wedding dress is removed. Though able to change between human and fox forms a Kumiho carefully guards its true identity.
hma76ce,Snoo8331100,11/27/2021,1,145.0,Yeah the key difference here. We dont need to know but his teammates and management are a different story. Im starting to think it truly wasnt something significant enough to warrant leaving 12 hours before the tournament begins and he knew it. His teammates would support his decision if it was something serious Bwipo has a gf that he praises every day so theres no way he would be pissed if Upset told him the matter is really important. And then you have the stuff like Upset playing arams with his wife during Worlds... I still think Adam shouldnt bring this to public but his and Bwipos anger is completely justified.
hm9qt8p,TheWalrius,11/27/2021,1,26.0,If they game is truly lost and undeniably so youll still get the 4 votes required to ff.  You however wont succeed on the early vote because 20% of your team doesnt agree that the game is entirely lost at 15 minutes.  Grow up if you cant fathom sitting in a game for 5 more minutes because your temper tantrum ff@15 failed. So tired of reading articles from people who spend 1000 hours on a game and then cry about time wasted when they cant give up immediately.  Im glad your clairvoyance allows you to see the outcome of a game before it actually ends. Please be patient with those of us that lack your clearly divine foresight.  /rant
hmbe45i,tanezuki,11/27/2021,1,,Well its a consequence of them synergizing better than any other champion with crits so yeah I guess.

hmb1z1f,CoogiMonster,11/27/2021,1,,Not OP but there most likely will be adjustments but expect them to be minor.  I believe they nerfed infernal soul because of damage output.  Also this drake is always going to be strong as any adjustments will either be to duration of zombie state or percent damage removed in this state (currently 33% less damage). At the core they’d never add a GA cooldown because they’ve already stated they want these too feel powerful compared to the others — which is just piss poor balancing IMO.
hmcy4eo,xd_Alimant,11/27/2021,1,127.0,i wanted to get project renekton... if its not out by the sales rotation then im going to be really mad because i need the capsule to have enough for the skin

hmaytao,100WattCrusader,11/27/2021,1,65.0,Statistically chemtech soul is far too strong.   And I mean Chemtech soul definitely feels stronger than elder although idk the statistics on that one.  To bring it in line it either needs a nerf of some sort or the other 5 souls need considerable buffs. One of them is easier than the other.

hmanr75,Nameless_One_99,11/27/2021,1,98.0,Nuguri is a shy introvert who was bullied a lot plus he has had a lot of health issues related to being underweight for example his lung collapse was in big part because he was so skinny.             FPX either knew all of this before hiring him or they were inept with their research. And despite all this they never made a big effort to integrate Nuguri into the team and the culture.       Only Tian who isnt part of management made an effort to try and help Nuguri.             Now Nuguri made mistakes too but this is mostly on FPXs management just look at how EDG made such a big effort with Viper who also has the advantage of being an extrovert and a happy-go-lucky kind of guy.

hmd3euz,J-Hart,11/27/2021,1,569.0,Id say there are levels to how mainstream a character can be but Chun-Li is in that category even if others are more well-known.

hmbnqsn,Nivelyx,11/27/2021,1,12.0,I see your point and i can agree to some extent. But if you compare the massive amount of anger around objective bounties compared to champion bounties i can only point to objective bounties being implemented more recently.   What you are saying is that the team that is behind is being rewarded for doing what is expected  / easy. Champion bounties is in my opinion doing the same thing to a larger extent but since it is individual it makes you feel helpless when some ADD downie idiot has a huge bounty on your team.  That helpless feeling you have when you see the enemy team collect objective bounties Paul is something you probably felt from champion bounties aswell maybe you are just so used to it nowadays since it has been in the game for ages?  You mentioned that a solution to champion bounties is suiciding to enemy support wow that sounds like a good/healthy aspect of the game that totally makes sense! maybe unhealthy solutions like that will be found for objective bounties aswell? my guess is that one of those will be to not take drakes if you notice you are winning a bit to hardto avoid triggering bounties.

hm9ywwm,That_Leetri_Guy,11/27/2021,1,431.0,Actually names wont be an issue due to how Riot ID works. You can have the same summoner name as someone else as long as you have a different tag. For instance you could have BoostedApe #EUW1 and BoostedApe #EUW2 on the same server without issues and both would only show up as BoostedApe in-game.  Eventually the summoner name will be completely replaced with the Riot ID (was supposed to be this year but Covid) which makes it much easier to get the name you want.

hmap22l,LazerFruit,11/27/2021,1,27.0,Blind pick is the worst way to play the game. Draft wont necessarily reduce the fighting ingame but people wont be arguing over roles and whatnot during champ select so theres less immediate toxicity. Mute all is also highly effective at making the game enjoyable

We know damn well that if given the true reason it would’ve ended up in his post   We dont.  Hyli was given the chance to get to know the truth Adam didnt. How would that make you feel when youre 5 humans in the team?  If anyone behaved unprofessionally its Upset choosing certain coworkers to know the truth and leave others in the dark.

You can already bond in the lobby when you set up a wombo combo together  I also feel that because of the fast pace a game goes by people become less toxic.

hm9633h,edgelordweeb_,11/27/2021,1,30.0,I dont think theyre getting Beishang/Weiwei/Wei but they should still be looking for a jungler regardless. Junjia Shad0w or Xiaohao are probably the most feasible options. All have buyouts but its 100% worth it to pay those buyouts to have a good competitive jungler. Xiaohao especially would be massive. Would mention SofM but I dont think hed fit TES well. Worst case scenario they have to just promote Naruto from their LDL team which has been rumored for a while now. Also the support will probably be Zhuo.

hmb41bz,xGlaedr,11/27/2021,1,402.0,You misunderstood my question. Wheres YOUR respect for Upset his family and their privacy? For someone crying for basic respect you give none to the person in the middle of a family crisis.  >thats the exchange that should have happen and not him leaving without letting people know   like im not even saying he should say 100% of what happen   just go to his teammate tell them something very important happen or something very bad happen but i cant tell you all etc etc  Oh you mean like he said he did twice before leaving?  >its just pure irresponsible to say it doesnt matter to his teammates  Never said it didnt matter to his teammates. I said they have no right to know anything beyond family emergency. If they trust him and Yamato it should be enough. And he clearly was right in not giving them any further info if Adam is so willing to spew bullshit and made up scenarios in his head because he thinks he deserved more information as well as seeing how everything leaks inside the League scene. Even without Adams twitlonger it wouldve gotten out anyways the less people know about it the less likely it is to leak.  >they dont need to know or they dont deserve to know  Both. Glad we agreed.
hmd6u3x,90CaliberNet,11/27/2021,1,51.0,What an absolute joke of a stretch no where did i justify their behaviour for how they treat their employees I was just acknowledging the content that honestly the people who probably got assaulted produced.

Outside of that its managed by a different company who does whatever they want with it.  Its a pretty common topic around here that the Garena servers are absolute nonsense cash grab schemes.  Unfortunate but thats how it is.

TBF it’s impossible to use champ mastery score as a supplement to justify rank cause you’ve played for so long. I myself have the highest mastery as a gangplank top player but now I’m a mid laner who is stuck in D2
hmckmsi,DremoPaff,11/27/2021,1,108.0,How surprising to see assassin mains justifying a broken assassin item in the comments with multipple flavors of its not that good. This definitely never happened before and isnt a recurring occurence at all.
hm8zwci,Syfix,11/27/2021,1,13.0,I hated them at first but am beginning to like it. It makes games where youre behind more bearable because you have a higher chance of a come back. Its frustrating when youre losing in league and you dont see any path to victory.  I used to dislike how it gave losing team free gold but its growing on me now. As the winning team I just make better trades and dont give the losing team any breathing room. I dont leave rift up on the map. I ward deep and counter rotate. I give up less free towers and objectives that I otherwise would have given if objective bounties werent a thing.
hm9zz5t,delahunt,11/27/2021,1,12378.0,One of her inspirations is literally the Joker.  Her lock in line is Rules are made to be broken. Like buildings...or PEOPLE!   Shes an insane remorseless killing machine. Arcane so far is the story of how she got there. And I think we dont see the real birth of Jinx until she pulls the trigger on the SMDR at the end. Hence the tears. Shes crying for the final death of powder.

I think he will be fine lol.
hmccvhl,Excalidorito,11/27/2021,1,422.0,Was not aware.  I always assumed the stats/mythic passive were the main attractions to it because unless I’m playing a really fat tank like Sion or Ornn I never really felt the flat true damage that much.  LDR always felt like the bigger difference maker especially when only about 10-11% of the damage I took from a marksman was true damage.
hmdar1e,AlphaTenken,11/27/2021,1,11.0,Dont play that gamemode
hma2eu9,delahunt,11/27/2021,1,12388.0,Do they though? I mean really how did the girl with the penchant for making bombs being raised by the second hardest crime boss to ever crime (behind Vander) end up a cold-blooded killer? It couldnt have anything to do with going from trauma to trauma to well make them all burn as her daddy right?  As for Ekko it makes sense. He knows Vi is going to save Vander with Mylo/Claggor. There is an explosion. Vi Vander Claggor Mylo are all gone...and Jinx is now living with Silco as his daughter. What probably happened is Ekko thought they were all dead for a bit and then later finds Jinx and knows it is powder. Hell its possible him realizing Powder is Jinx happens on the airship raid. But either way he knows Jinx is working for Silco.

hma867g,Mostdakka,11/27/2021,1,7.0,If you cant win sidelane you have to win teamfighrs. You are already in losing situation so you have to understand is that at best you are aiming to trade your lane for your team. Try to push the wave and rotate but if you cant there really isnt anything else to do but to leave and force 5vs4.

He died during the transformation in the lore and it wouldn’t surprise me at all that Singed collected the supposed corpse of Vander to experiment on. Also shimmer has a way of bringing people back to life in some sense it seems.

Then what the FUCK are you doing not only being signed to play next season but being a core and integral part of the entire teams blow and and rebuild?  If its that serious - get the fuck out.   If its not - which clearly after a reasonable amount of time it was NOT and no he wouldnt just be chillin in arams and scrolling through twitter if it was then fucking talk to the people who are getting their careers dicked on stage thanks to you.  All this just points to an inability on Upsets part to view himself as anything other than a victim. Which is not new btw

Jinx is flat on top thats true but any scene where it shows her whole body like in the arcade when she was trying to beat Vis score you can see she is not that skinny. At least in Arcane in the game she is as flat as a piece of paper.   This girls body is actually quite close to the jinx we see in Arcane

Not to mention that void is a really popular item among ap champs. Even more so than almost any other item that is not a mythic.  With void tanks or any other champ in this game have little to none MR against ap champs.
hm9ey9j,NamikazeEU,11/27/2021,1,49.0,Nah mate u gotta tell people who was actually best.   People like to throw in random names like Nuguri being best. Nah...

Dunno if there are such laws in France but in Germany if you talk shit on the internet you can be held accountable for what you post in the internet especially if you are attacking other people with false claims hatespeech and so on.

hmb0u83,LoLrovex,11/27/2021,1,341.0,Thank you.      I always thought as jungle as a role that impacts the map and Kayn has the best mobility in the game because of his ability to skip over terrain. I think Kayn in soloq has to be by far the best jungler since he has so much versatility (blue red purple forms). His w/r is middle of the pack because I think the champ is also popular but people bring down the w/r as they dont actually play him.

hm8vlds,ryantix,11/27/2021,1,20.0,Id argue that aram is too confusing for new players. The champion pool is from at least 65 champions which means new players are constantly having to figure out how to play new champions. In SR they can focus on learning one champion at a time and go into the game knowing what to expect.  Edit: I do think aram is a great place to learn once youve gotten a foothold in league though.
hmcahmw,Artisans_Arsenal,11/27/2021,1,5.0,Ill take that into consideration. Adding @ to a signature isnt very common. Im sure once I get big they will know where to find me :P  Haha. p.s  yes I do :)
hm9j2xh,shineyumbreon,11/27/2021,1,194.0,He probably plays for fun and refuses to use meta/and change his terrible habits. There is also a chance that he has a mental disability that makes it way harder for him to learn/improve which is totally fine.
hmc7g8y,RedZoomTV,11/27/2021,1,2.0,This is especially needed as I almost just lost a game due to this -        I was dead I had 2 teammates alive while the enemy team only had 1 zed. My jax was going to the nexus which was completely open while MF for whatever reason pinged the hextech dragon for jax to help her.        What ended up happening is Jax almost killed zed but zed lived and MF solod dragon instead of following jax. The whole time MF was Pinging dragon I was trying to spam ping the nexus and MF to end the game as the enemy team only had 1 person alive and it wouldve been free.        I only use pings to communicate as in all my years of playing league since season 2 Ive been talking in chat non stop mostly useless things and gotten many of my accounts perma banned because of it. Therefore I decided to disable my chat completely not even being able to open it so that I would prevent further bans and actually focus on the game. That worked as I got my first honor check point in pretty much ever and Ive gotten a higher rank

hmcbnwx,Mers1nary,11/27/2021,1,345.0,My vote is for Moocow Alistar then...You cant tell convince me it isnt the most popular skin and has one of the most popular voice lines in the game between his cowbell and You cant milk those.
hmcmh3n,Worried_Fee_9935,11/27/2021,1,626.0,You did great she is my favorite of barron straps characters. You look just like her. Awesome
hmda3f8,Clueless_Otter,11/27/2021,1,170.0,I dont know if Doublelift would be the best AD carry in the league but he definitely isnt going to be worse than players like Neo or Luger.
hmc100y,Ramus_N,11/27/2021,1,,If you mention HoB as being abused then I would expect it to be a good rune and not a mediocre rune being picked out of sheer desperation by a bunch of lower tier marksmen.
hmb8mz9,DoggyP0O,11/27/2021,1,163.0,Fnatic made the situation very clear from the start. We have learned literally nothing more about the situation with the recent drama.
hm9rdq0,Applepowdersnow,11/27/2021,1,4.0,if i go to loot and click on the prestige icon it opens the prestige shop for me.   are you missing the whole shop? then id contact riot supp to check on that.

hmbkfl6,SaulJoker,11/27/2021,1,94.0,Let me think.  Ziggs Heimerdinger Cassiopeia Ryze Karthus Singed Teemo Mordekaiser Kayle Kog’Maw Anivia Azir Brand Corki (who despite building adc items does magic damage mostly) Diana (to some extent) Gwen Kassadin Lillia Malzahar Morgana Rumble Shyvana Swain Zyra  All can build Liandry Demonic and/or Nashor’s/Wit’s End and/or have abilities/kits which allow them to continue outputting damage either due to low CDs high attack speed synergy or even both.  I’d say there’s plenty of magic damage DPSers out there.
hmc4bgc,fartdiroperandus,11/27/2021,1,210.0,I think the opposite is true at least from my experience. Learning to play extremely aggro and limit test let me actually learn my champs limits and made me climb super fast.  Learning to win harder when you win will win you more games than learning to not lose.
hma2cpi,tautckus1,11/27/2021,1,149.0,Throughout 2021 any negative mention of nisqy or adam got u downvoted and replied with hate by hoards of fnc flairs now their all shitting on both of them as soon as they got replaced. Its pathetic
hmabln5,MaleQueef,11/27/2021,1,101.0,Im pretty sure theyre getting there just the same as them starting to outsource a lot of skins for production. They promised us in a while wed get maps and announcer packs so I bet theyre currently working on making maps easier to do
hmbcehn,nyanko_dango3,11/27/2021,1,38.0,we got robbed from EDG vs RNG world finals
hma1ow7,drgreed,11/27/2021,1,115.0,Thats true because 3 years ago [Riot_Izeo](https://old.reddit.com/r/Draven/comments/9qrlof/draven_bug_fixes_mofos/e8gb80w/) pushed an issue on your bug tracker for Dravens axes with detailed info and a possible fix and its still up and broken! Great job!
hmagg4q,rjaydo2,11/27/2021,1,35.0,Sorry but I can quite honestly play the game in any fashion I choose. I play to gain LP for the competitive aspect. I dont find the game fun to play at a low elo in solo queue plain and simple.   It is a problem in lower elos yes but your post does not differentiate the break-point like I had described. Im stating that your opinion does not hold water after a certain elo bracket. The people not surrendering in the situations Im referring to are the ones griefing not the 4 others agreeing the game is over. Typically a 4-0 no vote comes with Ill just waste your guys time comment directly after.  Im going to stop here though since I have made multiple points throughout my posts of which you glossed over not addressed then inserted how your opinion of the game is correct over mine. Good luck on the rift my friend.
hm95g71,venomstrike31,11/27/2021,1,38.0,TK has a W knockup now too. Id definitely put him in the vanguard category.
hm98g3z,Triktastic,11/27/2021,1,54.0,Ornn next please. And I want it even when he is not in-match.
hmb6uvy,Coc0tte,11/27/2021,1,,It can only help.
hmbzpyf,piotrj3,11/27/2021,1,,Because you do not understand the whole situation with ADCs.  The problem is majority of ADCs cannot be played elsewhere at all. Like if they arent viable botlane then they arent viable at all anywhere. The only exceptions are Quinn who can function as top laner or Kindred as jungler but they are balanced around those roles and have specificly made kit for those roles. if you would let ADCs to be weak to make other champions good on botlane suddenly a lot of ADCs would meet winrate/pickrate criterias for buffs.  Another reason why botlane is so specific is because botlane has big exp penalty and a lot of champions cant literally function being behind in exp. Can you imagine playing as assasin or burst mage being by default every single game 3 levels behind? No. It feels horrible on midlane to be 3 levels behind you suck on lane and you cant gank anyone. Why do you believe it would be better on botlane? Basicly when some mage like Syndra who is burst mage and suddenly she becomes meta on botlane it is literally giant red flag that champion like her who should be based around bursting people and snowballing can function being levels behind.  There is very few minor exceptions from rule above like Yasuo is more based around items then levels so he can sort of function on botlane and he kinda do - you do can play him botlane and a lot of supports have good teamworking via knockups. Another case is Swain who also works well with supports due to his passive and guess what - that is where he functions now because as mid/top he is trash.
hma97pi,Funiquinho,11/27/2021,1,9.0,it should be avaliable today or tomorrow
hma65in,RevolutionaryBricks,11/27/2021,1,55.0,It’s gonna be 80 ping General Sniper vs Jetlagged Bwipo which is going to be an enormous amount of fun to watch- I’d imagine tired bwipo will just permafight
hmaawv1,ZTD09,11/27/2021,1,313.0,Have you never had a traumatic experience before? When I went through some shit I played arams until I feel asleep at my computer because it let me forget that some really bad shit was going on. People respond to trauma differently you’re actually fucked if you’re trying to crucify a guy for trying to find an escape from what could have been a really bad situation for him.
hmaizvx,blitzeeee,11/27/2021,1,7.0,Cho’gath is literally the violator from the spawn comics. Fiddlesticks on the other hand is a demon birthed in the first scream of creation. There are stories about fiddlesticks in every region of runeterra. The shurimans talking about some kind of monster that invades the tombs with treasure hunters already in them just to kill the hunters while the only thing that can be heard is screaming coming from the tombs entrance. The noxians prefer the story of a farmer that didn’t meet his quota for his month and was fed to the crows only to come back and haunt them. His in game base skin is his demacian iteration I believe. A collection of farm equipment and weapons cobbled together to form what someone could mistake for a scarecrow for 1 split second out of the corner of your vision before he races over and tears you to pieces. The way he moves is sometimes kinda like walking but it’s usually just 1 piece of equipment being tossed out in front and then used to drag the rest of the contraption along and when he recalls the demon gets out of the cage in the centre tethers itself to the contraption then flies off with them. He also plays like no one else in league and when your up against a fiddlesticks you find yourself standing a little further back from the walls in case you get ulted on out of nowhere and that mini heart attack you have when you face check a bush and one of his effigies flashes away sells this character for me.
hmbaf6m,nathe__,11/27/2021,1,12409.0,>The idea that shes two different people is something she made up   >   >Her actions before taking it were no different than her actions after   >   >its not ptsd or triggered by anything  So youre saying if Jinx isnt a result of powders PTSD and taking something that is basically the equivalent to IRL drugs (it has been shown that addicts become mentally deranged) Powder wouldve become Jinx anyways? 1000% if Powder still had her mother and Vander she would have turned out normal  Before Jinx was on shimmer she was still conflicted about Vi so thats what role it had. She basically turned her back on both Vi and Silco AND made herself #1 enemy of Piltover  I understand the freak-out moments of her character are cliche and over the top to make it look like that she is just crazy but its still clearly a result of her PTSD and drugs
hm9akjf,Raynar7,11/27/2021,1,6.0,Without the further context aka what started Zyra’s **that’s racist** it can be just you trying to get sympathy.  And without going deep into what terms are overused as heck….  People playing this game should be honest to each other. If everyone who writes something bad in chat would be banned nobody would play this game that’s just how it is. Game is not toxic people are. And having a competitive multiplayer game without any kind of toxicity is just utopia.
hmdb0ta,theuwudragon,11/27/2021,1,329.0,Uyghurs and Africa.
hmc4e9i,Attre_-,11/27/2021,1,55.0,Its not happening. Arcane did a good job of shoving as many league characters into the show as possible without it getting too ridiculous or plot-convenient. Not to mention the entire theory is based on Singed saying he also had a daughter...
hm93iz3,Karoth4,11/27/2021,1,38.0,Same as Thornmail it could be discussed if it is intended that Mortal reminder passive isnt the best for carries like Jhin or Samira because yes you can build it and yes you can proc the 60% grievous wounds but neither of those champs would land the same autoattacks as someone like vayne caitlyn jinx...  Im not entirely sure why not all the grievous wounds items apply the same way but well i guess for variety.
hm9e37b,NamikazeEU,11/27/2021,1,,Mate Zoom was best top laner last 3 years.

hm9hbt0,Noman_Blaze,11/27/2021,1,389.0,Its no different in LOL. Even with server lock no one is stopping people from speaking their native language. I play in EUW and every other game there is a player speaking their native language. That person is overexagerating. I play in EUW and EUE as well as in South East Asian servers in Dota and majority of the times people do speak English. Its not that common to get someone who only speaks their native language.   You can select English as your preferred language and only match with players who have selected the same. I guess that guy doesnt know this.

hmc4qkh,daudr9,11/27/2021,1,24.0,the truth is - majority plays really bad and also for some reason tend to insult others while they int themselves hypocrisy out of scale but if youre scared or stressed because of that you can not only mute them but also their pings and enjoy the game watching some champions moving around in silence
hmd7l87,Next_Vegetable_7851,11/27/2021,1,9.0,Lmao you guys pretend like anyone owes you stuff smh
hm9pp4s,Padouch1038,11/27/2021,1,12.0,IMO Yes Vadimir is giga strong. He can do so much damage to basically the whole team.    I started playing him last season and can tell you that if you underestimate him in lane he can get you lvl 4 to lvl 6 easily with full combo.    His only downside which is good is taht he has limited range and spells cost HP.
hmcku2p,imkaynmain,11/27/2021,1,2.0,Im not gifted but the padding carried me through ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
hmajrju,Gerblinoe,11/27/2021,1,376.0,If one of my parents were on their deathbed I would spend as much time with them as possible. Not playing ARAM lol.  Tonight on things you may not know if you never had a medical emergency:  Hospitals hospices and all that have visiting hours they arent open to guests 24/7   ICUs may not have visiting hours at all or they have very short ones   Due to pandemic a lot of hospitals currently dont do visiting hours at all or have reduced them significantly  Due to all that you can have a lot time on your hands as your loved ones are dying
hmcax8t,Exmerus,11/27/2021,1,345.0,Well yeah Ezreal is weird because he is supposed to be the safest adc. So he is highly picked because of thanks to the autofills lol unlike Yasuo or Zed for example.

hmb3mn4,Uhloy,11/27/2021,1,10.0,Make people agree to the ToS when buying (checkmark). Just like when you gamble with boxes.  At that point you cant complain. Just like you cant complain when you realize that opening boxes does not automatically give you the skin.
hmca9rz,SkeletonJakk,11/27/2021,1,405.0,>Crit itemization is arguably the worst its ever been. IE doesnt give as much damage as it used to and Crit items only give 20% crit.  So this displays clear lack of understanding of the game I think were done here.
hma7q5a,Ze_Ike,11/27/2021,1,7.0,The problem comes when team A gets soul but is weaker in teamfights than team B team B then proceeds to win the teamfight while team A revives and kills team B right back. The end result is neither team accomplishing anything on the map and the game stalling out even longer
hmafgq6,Rektile7,11/27/2021,1,376.0,Shes 27 i think.  Also needs a green card? Thats what i read at least.

hmcnsk5,dimitri0610,11/27/2021,1,6.0,Yeah its one thing at a lower level but theres no way this should be happening towards the top. It already takes people an incredible amount of time and effort to get where they are even just on one role. Now you put them off role against someone who is near the peak for their main role. No thanks.

hm8y8gc,MegaTurtleClan,11/27/2021,1,196.0,Agreed and thats part of the reason jg is so fun for me. Its super strategic and in higher elos your teammates kind of know what theyre doing so successfully pulling of baits and counterganks feels super rewarding.
hmczcid,SterbenVII,11/27/2021,1,87.0,At the same time it’d be bad for the orgs that invest in LoL if there was an open eSports circuit. Most of the money in DotA is allocated towards TI given that salaries are considerably lower. As for CS:GO there are too many fucking tournaments.  The good thing about an open circuit though is that NA and wildcards would probably be better relative to the top 3 regions due to constant interregional play.
hmaylc5,stuffslols,11/27/2021,1,10.0,Wave management mostly. If your Wave is pushing towards you then stay in your lane unless you have a crazy important objective like soul coming up. If theyre a split pusher your goal is to babysit them as much as possible and only leave when its absolutely necessary
hmaa4cq,NeekoBestTomato,11/27/2021,1,311.0,If the situation is calm enough to be sitting back and chilling in arams....

So you probably are good enough to pass by but aren’t great enough. But Thresh Ezreal and Bard are all great solo queue champs so it’s tough to say

hmcq9gi,xMisuto,11/27/2021,1,19.0,Ye matchmaking aint perfect but i believe lv100+ accounts that are players that are low elo for years is way more comfortable to play against thn all those -lv30 players that are tryhard smurfs from anything gold+ to stomp some newbews or ego trip or mmr boost or ego boost.  Dont focus to much on the lvls. It doesnt mean that much. If they are better thn after losing a bit youll face weaker opponents. The system will work eventually :).  Just enjoy have a good laugh. As a new player just play vs bots and aram till you mnow the champs a bit once you know skills etc thn you are ready for some randoms :)

hmbf9pd,Gerblinoe,11/27/2021,1,,You are getting awfully riled up when its basically 2 people speculating about some esport drama with no info    You arent alone in your feelings absolutely but I dont see what that has to do with anything?   And while Upsets teammates are angry as they have any right to be people like Yamato said that Upset was absolutely justified in leaving and Hyli who got more info than any other player isnt dropping any angry twitlongers   And again I cant say if he should have told them because first of all I dont know what happened and I dont know any of these people and neither do you.  I also dont see where Im blindly supporting Upset or anybody    I just said I cant judge shit because I dont know shit like everybody else in this subreddit    And that arguments like well he played arams so clearly nothing happened are bs simply because it doesnt prove shit because thats how people work.  I also said that if he left for example because his wife miscarried thats a valid reason which I will stand by because thats like basic human decency.   I guess you think that if I dont curse out Upset I blindly support him which seems weirdly combative but you do you.   To reitarate again I dont think you or me or anybody on this subreddit has enough knowledge about this situation or people involved to give any sort of solid who was in the wrong judgement

hm8xjym,BBQMasterDad,11/27/2021,1,2.0,I honestly think they’re pointless in the sense of… why the fuck does Riot keep trying to keep games from being snowballs? If a team is down bad enough to the point where they need some sort of “freebie pick me up” they shouldn’t deserve that bounty in the first place all it does is incentivize the winning team from defending pointless objectives at the cost of the enemy team getting a decent sum of gold for… literally playing the game? It’s the same reason why I believe shut down bounties are absurd.
hmcgerf,0x43686F70696E,11/27/2021,1,6.0,TLDR: Effective supports are champions who can function well with low gold.  Due to there being 3 lanes and a jungle but 5 champs on a team it was determined many many years ago the most effective way to play is to have 1 top 1 mid 1 jungle one carry in bot lane (typically an ADC but you see some other types in recent seasons) and a support in bot lane. The carry in bot lane is the one farming gold and the support is not farming. Champions are played in the support role due to them being effective with lower gold income.  You mentioned that some mages can be supports... The mages that you typically see being successful as supports have high base damage and low scaling damage. Very generally every spell has two damage components: a base damage and scaling damage. A simple way to think about scaling damage is that the spell gets additional damage based on how much Ability Power you have. For example if you have 100 AP and the spell has 10% AP scaling you would gain 10 extra damage. If it had 100% AP scaling it would gain 100 extra damage.   A champion with high scaling damage normally has low base damage but the more Ability Power (read: items that cost a lot of gold) they have the stronger they are. Therefore due to the way the game is played (one character in bot lane who is not farming gold) it is more effective to have a mage who does a lot of damage without items (due to high base damage and low scaling) than one who has low base damage/high scaling damage.  It is for that same reason you do not see ADC champions being played as support. Actually the one example i can think of where an ADC is played as support is Senna for the exact reason i outlined why mages are played as support -- she can get strong and do damage without gold due to her passive. Every other adc requires a lot of items (aka gold) to be useful so you do not see them as supports.  More traditional supports are either tanks/engagers (leona/alistar/taric/braum) or enchanters (soraka/lulu/sona/janna). Alistar does the exact same thing whether he has 0 gold or 10000 gold -- he jumps into the enemy team and knocks them all up. If alistar required lots of items to do his job you wouldnt see him as a support.

Dota 2 have different servers too but no region lock so you can play on whatever server you want and as a result both NA and EU are fucking horrifying every other game is 4 peruvians or 4 russians on your team screaming in their own language and communication is basically 0 people think its just gonna be oh I can play with my friend who goes on a different server more are in for a rude awakening if this actually happens.

Have you ever seen videos of Kayns staying in base and using global Ws to nuke people? Its literally the same principile and its just as gamebreaking since it works with hexflash. This is just redicolous.  Juggernauts arent supposed to fall off juggernauts are supposed to be durable and hard hitting but slow both in movements and in animations.  The other day i was playing Mundo 10 cs per minute and i was 100-0 both by Divine Sunder Akali and by a 3 items Kindred when i was full build.
hmcbb46,pacomesoual,11/27/2021,1,12.0,I think its working as intended and I wouldnt want it any other way the rune is called first strike it wouldnt make sense for the first thing to strike not to proc it.  A lot of recent items/runes/mechanics revolve around a spell activating something and most of the time the spell that activates the thing also benefits from it.  Horizon focus for exemple.
hm8ywux,Smol-Goblin,11/27/2021,1,17.0,I wrote to Rito asking for a WW plush and the dude who responded hinted that WW may be coming in season 2 in a big way so we would likely get merchandise then. I also believe WW to be Vander.

hm9xc8v,TheSoupKitchen,11/27/2021,1,36.0,Its pretty good for Caitlyn Vayne Jinx and Kog. Basically all the heavy auto attacking champions that dont give a shit about ability damage and scale for late game. In that regard Id say its great.  I do agree its REALLY good for melee auto attacking champs and arguably *better* for them than it is the ranged champions.  I have SO many problems with ADC. Seriously. If you spend enough time on this sub youll see me ranting and complaining about ADCs and how garbage of a state theyre in. The fact that every role got new items and stuff to mess around with and ADCs ONLY GOT LETHAL TEMPO speaks volumes for the preseason. Riot hates this role I swear. But i dont think its what I would personally complain about for the role.  Lets at least be consistent and accurate in our assessment of the garbage role that is ADC. This isnt it...

By the time you’re scaled the game is a 5v10.  I got into League in season 3 and absolutely loved it because there was minimal RNG. This season games are fully decided on the RNG of dragon soul.

hmd68fx,transformers03,11/27/2021,1,45.0,As a fellow Arcane lover yet LoL newbie this was a question I have been wondering myself for days.  As an outsider looking in Jinx was the only one I knew for years. Since I never watch or play anything League-related my only reference to the series was through external media and she was the only one I remember being named and having a personality. My sister-in-law is also a huge Jinx main so again my only reference to League was just through Jinx. That meant I always had a bias of her being the face of the series.  The only other character I knew/recognized from league was Ahri who I just referred to as sexy fox-lady. When there was speculation that a potential LoL character was going to make it to Smash my sis-in-law suggested would either be Ahri or Lux (or maybe she said Ashe). Thats when I realized maybe Jinx wasnt the face of the franchise as I initially thought.  But then Arcane released which completely reverted my opinion that Jinx is at least *one* of the faces of the franchises. Now that I know there are literally over *150 characters* in the series and the fact they have some version of a hugely successful K-Pop band known as K/DA (which Im not entirely sure what its supposed to be) there could be arguments that several characters are the face of the franchise.  With my research in which I tried to be unbiased as I could I think Jinx is at least in the top *five or ten* of the most well-known League characters. Stuff maybe like K/DA and some of those other YouTube videos with millions of views have more widespread appeal (there are a ton of K/DA fanart and cosplay) but I still think Jinx is up there and I think Arcane has painted her more of a central character for the franchise. Also based on my sis-in-laws knowledge Jinx holds a distinction for being the star of Riots first music video that earned them millions of views eight years ago. I feel like Riot has a soft spot for her for that which also explains why they chose to have their first narrative feature be so focused on her origins.  On that note theres a huge difference between being well-known and being popular to play in the game. A recent data shows that other champions are played way more times than Jinx (and even other popular characters). What Im referring to mostly who more well-known to the mainstream public and who Riot centers on as being its mascot. We all have our own biases I think I clearly stated mine but I strongly dont agree if someone says Jinx isnt one of the most famous champions as I think that is not true.  If I have ranked the champions in terms of notoriety in a post-Arcane world then I would say it is Jinx Ahri Lux Ashe and maybe Vi and if not Vi then the rest of K/DA.
hmcs6s0,AaronDeath,11/27/2021,1,121.0,I mean i would say the contrary. Hes playing olaf to win because its good in the game despite not liking the champ. Unless you’re implying Spica is trolling the tourney by playing a champion that isn’t good/he doesn’t like for whatever reason.

hm9itxf,Sk8thunder,11/27/2021,1,40.0,Tencent owned League in season 6. Plus Tencent doesnt have any say in what riot actually creates
hmaffsj,Rodniconii,11/27/2021,1,66.0,Thats actually a good question but I dont believe so. I would have to check it again. If she did then it would make her heel turn make more sense. It wouldnt change my mind about SOL at all because of how horribly the characters were portrayed. Especially considering many of the characters that should have been in the story werent.
hmbdg70,appleforbannanas,11/27/2021,1,,Whoops I thought i s responded to it as well
hmap3bb,xTheBurgerMan,11/27/2021,1,259.0,Guys talons walljump doesnt use mana and that is definitely totally a bug you need to fix as well. Damn what a frustrating bug
hmb39g1,BahLo-,11/27/2021,1,402.0,Because if its something series whats the harm in letting your teamates know? There is literally no harm in that then they would understand and support him.  Copy pasting what another user said agreeing with me listing what we know.  With what we know theres a lot of evidence to show it was probably because of his wifes feelings. which is BS.   &#x200B  I think it is pretty obvious from everything that Upsets wife was saying she was depressed. And then the day before worlds she probably called him crying or something and then he rushed him.        So he went home and to cheer her up he played some ARAM.        This fits with everything anyone has said on the issue and with the actions.        We know:        1 It was an issue going on for several weeks that got worse just before worlds (a sudden event)        2 It was to do with his wife - Yamato in the interview linked the two when talking about it he said how dedicated upset was for grinding after this marriage and how it was really tough for him at the time (why the fuck would you get married during the season rather than waiting till the offseasons I have no idea).        3 Upset wont say the reason because people will question if it is a legit reason and harass his wife.        4 Adam said his wife was feeling lonely which fits.        5 Fits with all the wife buff comments from bwipos gf that they later said was a coincidence (obviously it wasnt lol).
hm91cph,SeizureLizard,11/27/2021,1,19.0,Sniper and Ablaze are both pretty damn good lol I would say they have one of the stronger rosters here

hmd7eif,Feyral,11/27/2021,1,3.0,A lot of vision abilities are broken right now probably thanks to the interactions they have with Chemtech terrain another thing that seems to be broken right now: stuns Warwick won a fight by an auto attack that he did while stunned by Jax E. Thankfully that lane matchup is heavily Jax favored so I still won the lane/game.
hm9wvxj,rimidalv25,11/27/2021,1,1540.0,Ornn and malph is actually the same. Theyre still rooted after their respective spells. Malph just has a dash during the immunity
hm8wfi4,Lord_Dust_Bunny,11/27/2021,1,20.0,I think 6 is a visual bug: Ws cooldown is supposed to only start after the mark has been consumed or expired.
hmajfn6,Swapsta,11/27/2021,1,375.0,The teammates should atleast know that gravity of the situation it feels like they dont know if upset is just giving an excuse or not. Adam thinks upset went to see his wife this means he thinks upset is bullshitting. Bwipo is dissatisfied with the answer as well.  You dont have to state the exact reason but if your teammates just says some vague reason and leaves then it shouldnt be surprising they dont trust you. Upset expects his team to understand and hyli does but Adam and bwipo are sceptical about the reason.
hmcit7k,l9fembhoy,11/27/2021,1,,the shards came out at like 4pm uk time so lets just wait a bit
hmc8ogm,Chimuss,11/27/2021,1,54.0,Im out of the loop on the one can someone explain what this is ?
hmd035u,GroundbreakingAlps2,11/27/2021,1,30.0,I was watching this from general snipers perspective and it was honestly insane to watch. Bwipo just hard won lane from level 1 three games in a row. Just completely dumpstered him in the first trade of the game three times in a row.   Bwipo also had really good tp usage and map movement while every play general sniper went for where lackluster/bad. Im not sure if gs had even a single positive play (with tp). Outside of his bad tps he was just sitting afk in lane and taking turrets obviously quite a bit easier to play like that. I dont think it was too bad. It was mainly that everytime he pressed TP he put the enemy team one step closer to winning the game.   He couldnt match bwipo whatsoever.
hm9e5kf,K1ndr3dSoul,11/27/2021,1,4.0,Its best to focus on yourself and what you could do better. You can think of other players as experimental bots. Riot tries to balance accounts to have a 50 win rate so if your win rate is high youll likely have mates with a lower one.    The more you win the more your MMR can increase giving you better teammates but people int or throw even in higher elos its just less often or severe.
hm9u6s4,after___thought,11/27/2021,1,12366.0,But its true in this case? Plot armor is real lol

hmbo9ln,daswef2,11/27/2021,1,,Interestingly enough Jinx and Lucians highest winrate points are 15-20 minute games.  Their winrates plummet between 30-40 minutes until they recover ultralate.  Taking a look at the higher pickrate supports Thresh Leona Senna Nautilus Rakan Alistar Maokai Seraphine Braum Rell Yuumi Sona Zilean all have huge winrate spikes as the game goes later while looking at marksmen only Vayne Kaisa Miss Fortune Aphelios Samira Ezreal have significant increases in winrate as the game goes on (everyone else peaks around 20 minutes and then nosedives).  Depending on what marksman you are running unless that marksman is immediately popping off and you are playing through them to end early Id make the argument that you are better off getting your support ahead or unlocked.  There are way more viable mid/late game powerful supports that you can accelerate into their strongest points while theres a significantly lower amount of upward curving marksmen.  I think we are perhaps underrating the strategy of getting our supports big and overrating the value of marksmen vs the amount of resources they require.

hma8c5r,Mantial,11/27/2021,1,,You obviously dont have to go into specifics but you also have to remember that your teammates coaching staff etc. have invested thousands of hours and a year of their life into that team and you leaving effectively means all that time is wasted so you have to make sure that those people understand that you have no other choice but to leave.  I dont think Upset left for a small reason but I do think that someone dropped the ball hard when it came to communicating the reason why Upset left to the team.

Any tank shouldnt kill anything with combo tbh. People seem to forget there was a time where tanks did normal dmg and took like 2 skill rotations to kill people and thats what tanks are in majority of games. Nowadays any tank can use 1 combo and massacre anything that is not an offtank or another tank.

hmab0go,BLHXsuperman,11/27/2021,1,52.0,There was a pretty bad situation between the two with one of the Doinbs channel mods who is supposedly Doinbs wifes friend talked trash about Tians performance. The community didnt like it and started bashing Doinb for keeping her and not backing up Tian then the main controversy came later on when that mod donated a large sum of money along with a message that talked shit about Tian Doinb read that donation out loud Chinese community was outraged about this saying he is willing to do anything for money made a huge drama between the two Doinb lost a ton of followers eventually I believe Doinb apologized and the two seemingly wrote it off but the Chinese community dont think so.   This along with one of the past clip that had Doinb (imo jokingly) said Tian shouldnt be given Fmvp for the year they won worlds have made the Chinese thinks that the two dont like each other accusing Doinb as a backstabber and it is also one of the main reason why his reputation is pretty bad in Chinese community right now.
hmcyh6l,Prunedsis,11/27/2021,1,87.0,Yeah Im hoping he will at least get an academy or coaching offer he really just wants to get back to NA in some way it seems like.
hmam8hu,Jstin8,11/27/2021,1,28.0,Yeah but the kicker right now is that those percent pen items are just as good as your 2-3 item as it is at item number 6. And as soon as they buy it 2nd or 3rd they turn your entire tank build into wasted gold.  Throw in the fact that tanks cant even get online have the weakest early game they have ever had AND the fact you can get an anti tank mythic and theres a reason Riot has been straight buffing tanks and their items last season and this preseason

Plus out of respect to my teammates who are struggling at Worlds because I had to leave them.  If I wanted to play ARAM to take my mind off things I would start a new account and not use my main as that would bring unwanted attention to both myself and my team.
hm9wena,Ozaiko,11/27/2021,1,69.0,Winter Map with its music is one of my fondest memories of this game. Sadly there is no love anymore for this game and Rioter wont take a day to put effort into that and rather spend time thinking about the new chinese new year skin

hmaswal,toshiroryuuzaki,11/27/2021,1,,No she wasn’t mediocre before—she was quite strong and had a really good win rate. She was just not being played that much. This buff was just too much for an already good champ.
hmccqvm,Large-Leader,11/27/2021,1,,You can but the taunt is randomized between two now. IDK if the method I used still works either but to be completely honest Im not very sober right now   As an aside it also doesnt help that if your Q is on CD it makes your character stop to emote which can be difficult when youre trying to spam that last q out before you die/to kill someone.
hmanm66,Xeasar,11/27/2021,1,129.0,You do understand the map is coded to transform in 6 different maps depending on the drakes right? It would mean completely making 6 new maps and their transitions maybe.
hmccrhp,darkhelel,11/27/2021,1,235.0,Mmm....THAT IT the problem is that the effect is just somewhat the opose to elder drake  So the dragon should be a new elder counterpart and thats it:  After one team obtain the dragon soul  * first next dragon gonna be elder * then second one gonna be chemtech  * third gonna be elder and continue.....

hmagfdy,herptydurr,11/27/2021,1,112.0,Well to be fair...  1. Winter maps are kind of eye cancer so a large number of people dont actually like the re-skin despite liking the *idea* of a re-skinned map.  2. Its only winter in the northern hemisphere. It is actually summer time in the southern hemisphere.  3. Changing the map skin isnt as simple as adding snow everywhere. You have to test the visual clarity of all spells/abilities for each skin at all locations on the map... and for the various different kinds of colorblindness.

hmcmzef,Jdorty,11/27/2021,1,299.0,I kind of agree with your first point but...  > where would you find fire air rock water or old on the periodic table?  This is kind of funny.  Youre thinking of the wrong definition of elemental or elements.  It isnt referring to a chemical element but elemental as in basic forces of nature.    > related to or embodying the powers of nature.  > a thunderstorm is the inevitable outcome of battling elemental forces  > of relating to or resembling a great force of nature  > the rains come with elemental violence  > elemental passions  In Fantasy this is almost always Fire Earth Water and Air as the basics.  Pokemon could be considered different elemental types.  These Fantasy ideas most likely come from old school theories like The Five Elements Theory or in China Wuxing Five Phases.
hmd1stx,Bach_Gold,11/27/2021,1,410.0,Gold.
hmcgq0g,piotrj3,11/27/2021,1,422.0,Guinsoo stuff was nerfed by nerfing guinsoo.  2nd was that Yasuo/Yone used to not get bonus AD for overstacking crit what meant they they had worse itemization post 2 items. Now they can get all the crit items they want and get bonus AD on top.  3rd. GP was underperforming and GP was building exclusivly non crit stuff. Like GP was using lethality items divine tsundere etc. He before changes used to be good pro play pick and after item changes almost everyone dropped him.

hm8yux6,Zlera-Kilc-odi,11/27/2021,1,199.0,Honestly I think Riot just wants Rengar players to stop playing. The new Chemtech soul completely removes bushes that arent in the river && overall the invisibility zone just works like normal fog of war (aside from warding.)
hmaahmw,frumfram,11/27/2021,1,313.0,Yeah lots of people seem to agree that communicating wasnt good in this matter  It is weird though there was Yamatocannon interview on FNC worlds video that seemed sincere about the severity of it all perhaps that wasnt communicated internally to all the players properly

hmc34vb,SoulResonanceRDT,11/27/2021,1,8.0,How do you determine popularity... just because a poll says more people like X champion doesnt mean that YOU will like them  I mean I am a support and Thresh is probably the most popular support champion from what I remember but personally I dont care much from his playstyle and prefer Nautilus more in that regard.
hmadbbb,doglop,11/27/2021,1,57.0,No the misconception is fault of Riot themselves changing the meaning of canon every time you ask them. Yes the main event per se is canon but not even rookie can be said to be canon in the big scheme of things. He is canon in the novel but the novel isnt fully canon so....
hmb9iev,RandomNameWhatevr,11/27/2021,1,9.0,Theyve been making both Demacia and Noxus more grey for a while theres no longer good and bad guys all of them have their stuff
hmahfzx,Rexsaur,11/27/2021,1,116.0,You know what was even better on jinx? Old LT giving you 110% AS the moment you start fighting (you could easily trigger it with a W before even getting in range).  The new one is only better in lane for her (since you only lose around 10~20% AS early on and its easier to stack in lane where stuff isnt one shotting you yet) and not that much better even.
hm9u7gr,Tanriyung,11/27/2021,1,11.0,Rarely generally that happens when a champion have a big rework which makes the champion completely different to play and have an updated visual.  It happens a few times a year max Arcane is really special for Riot (and for the community)
hm9w9yv,fojek17,11/27/2021,1,1.0,If you build Axiom on Karthus you are straight up trolling. You invest 3k gold into an item that gives you no stats outside of small amount of ability haste. It is not worth to purchase it ever on this champ even considering the ult cd refund.  Chemtech drake:  A soul is suppoused to be superstrong. You need 20+ minutes to get enough drakes to get it. Would you rather have another cloud soul?  On another hand I will say that chemtech rift with camuflage zones is one of the worst changes Ive seen in the game. Each SR rift game for me is praying that the rift wont turn to chemtech.  First strike - huge cd on that rune and it goes on cd whenever you get hit by a champ. Pretty simple to play around this rune. The only people who can actually use it are ranged champs which get 70% of its effectiveness.

hmabeb0,DaveidT,11/27/2021,1,313.0,People deal with grief differently. I feel like it’s crazy to see people put Upset down because of how DL dealt with his grief.
hmcqjwm,moodRubicund,11/27/2021,1,490.0,Hmmm I dont know thats kind of how people felt about Batman and then the MCU happened and people fell in love with the other Rich man in expensive equipment superhero Tony Stark.
hmcvfdq,The_Gunboat_Diplomat,11/27/2021,1,,Good odds he plays an assassin. Pantheon into assassins is legit a free lane for him
hmcg15d,tmbosweettooth,11/27/2021,1,7.0,damn nice. next goal?
hmc0di5,SaulJoker,11/27/2021,1,,I mean I’m pretty sure that League’s biggest spike in popularity up until now was when Get Jinxed got released alongside Jinx.  At the time it was something that had not been done so well before or so I think.
hm9n8pn,pelacur,11/27/2021,1,132.0,Ghost was mid tier ADC at best before he won Worlds. Players can have resurgence I dont know why people are so fixated that if players didnt have an explosive debut then the players cant improve.  I dont even rate Doran that high but rating Zeus above Doran is freaking funny.
hmc0f6u,TheSoupKitchen,11/27/2021,1,373.0,Galeforce active is almost twice as long as any other mobility active item its also often the worst purchase if you need to fight tanks (Kraken) or if you need to stay alive from assassins (Shieldbow).  Lord doms is almost always a mandatory buy early but its shit.  Shieldbow is just fucking broken. But so is steraks. Lifesaving shields are a fucking awful and flawed design. Its also more often abused by melee champs anyway.
hmblh49,gravy3000,11/27/2021,1,,Simply conjecture...however admittedly everyone is entitled to have their own opinions and rank
hmb6vjk,sameo15,11/27/2021,1,549.0,I showed this to my gae sister and she died of gae heart attack.
hmbxk73,br_silverio,11/27/2021,1,196.0,I played a game today that made me really pissed. Team full griefed bot feed and jungle was kinda afk but since I was playing Kayle and was 3-1 I kept going. Late game ull build level 18 everyone on my team had already came back to the game but it was just impossible to win because whenever there was a team fight we played 5v10 because every dead character would just comeback with all their skill set available. It felt really unfair
hmcnl7e,FunMoistLoins,11/27/2021,1,455.0,Yeah Renekton told him to do it and than he was brainwashed by Xerath over time to blame Nasus for it.   By all accounts Nasus is good or neutral at worst.
hmc0l4t,Talonoscopy,11/27/2021,1,,Too much charisma can be annoying. He definitely goes there. Sounds like he tries too hard to be charismatic tbh not some sort of natural leader type.
hmbfgnj,Nivelyx,11/27/2021,1,1.0,You are skipping some events that happened. Most likely the yi got fed of CHAMPION BOUNTIES which are the real problem.   People really need to wake up to how impactful champion bounties are too the game. An objective bounty gives u an extra 100-300 gold? the yi could get a 700g bounty of a champ kill.
hmc2pn0,WantToDie78,11/27/2021,1,54.0,adc abuser  ok bud

hma3ma6,Quirky_Lychee_693,11/27/2021,1,47.0,Pseudointellectual take. Heres an analogy.   If I enjoy going to theater that doesnt mean I have to enjoy watching every single play ever made. I also dont have to sit until the end of a shitty play I dont enjoy.  This guy is acting smug about watching until the end of the very worst plays put on stage and scoffs at people who want to leave while jerking off how cool he is for sitting until the end of every garbage play.
hmc8i9x,owomachineuwu,11/27/2021,1,31.0,biscuits is the worst rune in the game and noone can change my mind on that
hm9nn7a,Oracle_1080,11/27/2021,1,3.0,I swear Ive seen this exact post before still cool though.  I really wish Riot would just put my favourites at the top by default.
hmbgv9e,ApplePitou,11/27/2021,1,5.0,This has been a problem for a long time because this game evokes negative emotions in many people and often people like that just become toxic :3
hmamafv,felfirelol,11/27/2021,1,129.0,They put map dev time into hextech and chemtech drakes. Winter map wasnt updated to work with elemental drake terrain changes.
hm9smua,Ebobab2,11/27/2021,1,22.0,healed 700hp with fleet lmao  jhins ad scaling is fat
hmbk2zq,pseudolemons,11/27/2021,1,303.0,Or you know most people dont change their runes dramatically on their good champions or adapt well to a new playstyle and those who are trying it because its supposedly good are not experienced enough so for instance if their pick rate increased tremendously and theyre 52% wr thats way more telling than a very small stable playrate champion having a 52% wr.   This is the problem with statistics you have to use your brain a lot not to take wrong conclusions with it.   Funnily enough this is also why scientific discoveries can be very debatable even though theyre supposedly dealing with facts. Theres nothing fun about this nvm.
hm9y2yr,NickAlpha,11/27/2021,1,4.0,Me when I see polish people in eune
hmdb21o,zammouri2001,11/27/2021,1,93.0,Hmm depends on your playstyle. You like something quick that goes in and out? Id recommend leblanc akali or zed. Or if you like someone who stays in battle dodging everything and making every fight a display of skill Id recommend yasuo and sylas. Or much much easier master yi and ahri. Ultimately I know nothing about you so these are very general picks youll have to find what suits you eventually.
hm9oepi,EnvironmentalBook,11/27/2021,1,21.0,Dont play League then. You dont get to steal someones vote cause you disagree with them.
hmbzta7,Talonoscopy,11/27/2021,1,31.0,Koreans arent tanned dafuq you on?
hma3ix9,ASSASSIN79100,11/27/2021,1,149.0,They already know something happened to his family. Thats why his situation is called a family emergency. The reason why its called a family emergency is so h donMt have to go into every detail about it.
hmcg4xz,Cordobra,11/27/2021,1,7.0,Whats the best and cheapest way to collect all the skins?
hmcioq8,PrincessKat17,11/27/2021,1,249.0,I think they’re in the loot crafting area. I can’t find them in my inventory either
hmce8bi,ultimate_spaghetti,11/27/2021,1,395.0,I wouldn’t say main character. Probably the wisest and experienced. Main characters need to be green and inexperience who we need to follow and grow with. Ezreal and Lux both fit that the type.
hma5fsj,flipswitch,11/27/2021,1,372.0,I feel like one thing cosplay consistently gets wrong is the hair color is too light and saturated. Obviously blue hair isn’t ‘natural’ but going darker and having slight variations of hue in it would go a long way to making it feel more realistic.
hmcz7xb,RemoteAnalysis3809,11/27/2021,1,317.0,Where did Riot say they wont do holidays again?   Also Mecha was literally the skin line that was made to replace the Lunar new year events. They were trying their best to not alienate yall with that.  Also dude Im a Vietnamese person. Not CCP bots.  I agree with you saying Riot cater to the Chinese fan base but let me also remind you once again that LOL is fucking huge in Asian Pacific countries. Taiwan Hong Kong Vietnam Korea a good chunk of Asian Americans and Asian Canadians WANT THIS SHIT. Its not just Chinese players. Its almost everyone in Asia Pacific. And we are the biggest demographic for this game by a very large margin.  We arent CCP bots. We are actual humans and we make up about 90% of the playerbase of this game. Im sorry that you guys dont get the same treatment as we do but calling us CCP bots isnt helping.
hmam5vb,internetuser25,11/27/2021,1,90.0,I had Matt in one of my Aram games a few years ago enemy team comp countered ours hard but the dude managed to go like 21/3 on Anivia and dragged our limp carcasses to a dub.
hmcyxbd,arelei,11/27/2021,1,87.0,wait yall actually exist?
hmarak9,AureaMediocritas1,11/27/2021,1,2.0,only when you subscribe to my youtube
hma5nv5,UX1Z,11/27/2021,1,147.0,Appeal to authority is only a fallacy when you cant draw a relation between the authority and the subject. For instance between a doctor and say economics. It is not a fallacious appeal to authority to say This economist has this opinion on economics.
hma7k3r,LargePopsicles,11/27/2021,1,208.0,DDOSing IS illegal and can get you prison. It is a federal crime.
hmc0jao,Inmonic,11/27/2021,1,214.0,I disagree. I think all the other drag souls need buffs to be on the level of chem soul. I love that getting soul actually means something significant in solo queue now. Previously infernal soul was the only largely impactful one and even then it didn’t feel like that big of a buff considering how hard it often is to get soul.  The chem map sucks though. Please change that shit Riot. The invis zones are weird and not having any bushes is even weirder.
hmcq5cn,LIGHTOUTx,11/27/2021,1,43.0,I called dips already
hmb3kgg,dsffff22,11/27/2021,1,147.0,Actually the Upset situation is a management failure by Fnatic. Upset should not have to clarify anything nor care about what other people think and Adam should have gotten answers to his questions from the Fnatic management. A good team should just act as an umbrella for their players.
hmap5xv,ClassicCraft,11/27/2021,1,139.0,naw ive played letho tempo jax / trundle top and its disgustingly busted. 1 mistep in the first 4 levels and the enemy pretty much gets mauled to death
hmcqaas,SNSDave,11/27/2021,1,,Caitlyn Vi Jinx Jayce and a few others talk because of the Arcane promotion
hm9lmw0,TH3RM4L33,11/27/2021,1,230.0,No. Shadow Assault should not cancel inputs since it has no cast time. I was agreeing that any other ability should cancel the attack.

hma5h3c,Honorable_Sasuke,11/27/2021,1,58.0,Look at the preset photos that WOMBO gives you and theyre all very very similar to these ones.  The catch is that it doesnt really do anything but morph its own existing photo

hmcle06,Quintana_of_Charyn,11/27/2021,1,55.0,Luckily for me empathy/sympathy is free and it takes nothing on my part to do the right thing.  It also takes more courage to be vocal about calling it out and following through then it does to be toxic in the first place or to be a wuss and not do anything at all.  Ive been doxxed had my life threatening countless times had my family be tracked down and harassed told to KMS and so much more so many times all for saying things like Dont be a douchebag or Ill report you.  Hell Ive had gore porn spammed at me for months on Twitter by dozens of bot accounts over calling people out.  I find it funny you call people like me soft when its people like you who go to such lengths to attack people you disagree with or you who gets outraged when someone asks  another person to stop.  A coward is someone who stands by and does nothing when they know something wrong is happening you yourself admitted that its wrong you just dont care to do anything about it so the real coward is the person without the backbone to speak up aka you.  And the thing is? I dont need thanks or recognition or anything just doing the right thing is enough reward for me.  Its rich seeing people like you try to insult me though as if I havent dealt with your kind for years pro tip real people dont act like your alt right echo chambers. I am not going to burst out crying because you called me a name more likely Id cuss you back twice as bad just without using slurs.  Also thanks for making my bathroom break entertaining. I needed something to kill time while taking a dump.  Also your blocked so dont bother responding. Youre a waste of time to talk to outside of taking a shit.
hmb4tii,Linyoa,11/27/2021,1,30.0,When Im playing lane I dont bother typing to toxic people I just mute them as soon as theyre toxic. When Im playing jungle I  just insta full mute all non-premades. Laners (mostly) know nothing about jungling but still try to backseat you constantly so I dont wanna see their shit even if theyre not toxic.
hmblgh5,Faze_TiTaN,11/27/2021,1,16.0,Maokai gained sentience due to the latent power of the meeps that took residence in his trunk. He now fosters life on this new home of his collecting and caring for young meeps that could use a helping hand (or branch).

hmaiulw,Higais,11/27/2021,1,441.0,One of the only good shows that I have to skip the intro. The songs not as bad as some other ID hits like Thunder but man does it suck anyway.   Every song of theirs is just like I am a legend or everyones my enemy everyones out to get me.

hmd5pqd,woody630,11/27/2021,1,1382.0,So Imma be real I think the way Vi treated powder in episode 3 was uncalled for but the way Jinx loves Silco is kind dumb af. She literally saw this guy try to murder her adoptive father and Vi while she still loved her but some how treats him better than anyone shes met. Like if he captured her and conditioned her I think it would make more sense but it seems like she just got there on her own.
hmbl295,redted2005,11/27/2021,1,172.0,She getting the Azir treatment huh
hm9y5fe,kingpsd_22,11/27/2021,1,14.0,Honestly kind of saw that coming especially when you hear a lot of FPX mic check you rarely hear nuguri speaking up.
hm9tt5w,P0pt,11/27/2021,1,46.0,you misunderstood the 8 pack is on his dick he has a 24 pack
hmawi32,UnNumbFool,11/27/2021,1,502.0,The wig thing is simply because the big ones you see are just shitty low quality wigs that are badly styled.  I mean low quality wigs are harder to style in general and by making the hair big youre basically hiding how shitty the wig is in general.  Im going with the girl didnt want to spend a couple hundred bucks(as jinxs ponytails are a fuck ton of hair) to make it a quality wig.  Truthfully a better quality regular hair blue wig with long ass extensions would probably be much better and easier to style naturally. But I mean not everybody has the money and even more so the skill to do that.
hm9asyi,painteroftempest,11/27/2021,1,359.0,No??? Grandmaster/chall  eune is like d2-1 game quality euw

hm9e7se,MarxistPigeon,11/27/2021,1,49.0,No. He is saying that mid pool in LPL is dogshit so even a mere washed up player like Yagao becomes decent. Which isnt true. LPL mid pool is pretty decent Knight FoFo Doinb Scout are all on par with elite LCK mid players. Then you still have promising rookies thats gonna become beast soon like Creme and Shanks.
hmcoae4,PaltaNoAvocado,11/27/2021,1,85.0,Also Im pretty sure his... work at Ionia finished to break Zed relationship with the Kinkou meaning that he also affected Zed Kayn and Shen (and Akali)  Btw did Noxus used his poison/fire/whatever it is against Demacia? Bc that would add like 5 more champs.

hmbs6jz,Efficient-Law-7678,11/27/2021,1,,I wasnt speaking about these champions in particular. I was disagreeing with you that ban rate doesnt mean anything. There are champions like caitlyn that have rose to +50% ban rate which indicates a big problem.  To say it doesnt mean anything is actually stupid.

hmc134l,Ok-Variation4621,11/27/2021,1,262.0,Maybe his point is that despite Riot saying they don’t wanna do holiday themed events anymore they still make the Lunar New Year events which are even more limited in terms of numbers of cultures celebrating them than Christmas. So it seems hypocritical and biased toward China.

hmc3kc6,GiventoWanderlust,11/27/2021,1,18.0,Yeah. The thing to remember is that youre competing against different numbers on a champion by champion basis.  Youll find that its sometimes easier to get an S on non-meta champions (or champions in weird roles) because youre not competing against as many players for your rank.

hma1jab,hiccup333,11/27/2021,1,12378.0,I felt EXACTLY the same way.  Like really ruined the character of Vi for me.  Felt like she was doing the bare minimum in the dinner scene.  And like you said she also already walked away from Jinx on the bridge scene earlier.  For me the whole hook of the show was their relationship I was really disappointed by the end

hmdayzy,TFTisbetterthanLoL,11/27/2021,1,170.0,Made me so mad that sneaky had to play with an academy level support while he was playing out of his mind. Keep Sneaky for Zven and having a sneaky vulcan bot lane would’ve been insane… an actual strongside bot or top (fudge) making drafting so much easier with sneaky being the best weakside adc NA has ever seen.
hm8zllh,ImTheNguyenerOne,11/27/2021,1,145.0,Yeah passing on 4 years 70 mil to sign a 4.1 mil qualifying offer then a 2 year minimum at just under 2 mil a year isnt a good look. It just kinda feeds into the idea of not being too greedy Rich Paul told him he was a 100 million man and he ended up making like a third of that contract with the 27 million he just signed for with the Knicks

hmcrp5p,SereKitten,11/27/2021,1,,Because furries are the low hanging fruit that bullies love to cling onto online and its honestly extremely annoying. Most furries Ive met have been nice-- some a bit quirky I guess but they really dont deserve the ire of a bunch of nerds who probably have less going socially and in life in general than most furries do just because theyre the easy targets to hate on.   Case in point: A comment implying that furries want to breed with real animals (comparing the vastaya in animal form thing with them) is upvoted while a comment saying They dont actually want to have sex with animals is downvoted.  Jokes stop being jokes when people are serious and the target isnt in on the joke. Thats just harassment and bullying and furries dont deserve it from a community that pretends to care about their games toxicity problem.
hmc4iv8,cr_y,11/27/2021,1,87.0,Every professional cosplayer edits the fuck out of their photos. [Even their candid photos are edited](https://i.imgur.com/HZIIrhc.jpeg). Its pretty weird tbh.

I have 10k BS and I almost never get oops all russians games unless I party up with people with bad BS and even if I do get them(solo) they still communicate just not in fluent english.   I see wasnt aware of that sadly.  >The only difference between EUNE and EUW in terms of communication is that in EUW the non-communicating guy will speak french or spanish instead of polish or greek.   There are a lot more countries who refuse to speak english on EUNE mainly polish/turks/czech/slovenians/arabs and the cases of it are a lot more common compared to just a few instances like those on EUW that i had.   For reference I played on EUNE since s3-s8 when i transfered to EUW and im there since then while also holding an alt on EUNE both being low elo so myb the situation is better on eune/worse on euw in high(er) elos.  >In terms of skill below masters its always a coinflip as youll get carried-by-champ wannabe solo carries mute magnets and other toxic or clueless players on all servers.  I feel like people on EUW are tryharding more while EUNE players are treating ranked worse than normals. Sure theyre all shit on every server but I personally prefer EUW because you know they will try as long as their mental doesnt explode.

Ahh it does bring some memories back. 😎  No but as an serious note play the champs you find interesting thematic wise or gameplay wise take time to test different shit out and youll find yerr match eventually.

For your skill level play easy-medium to pick up mid lane champs that could get ahead fast and carry games. If you could roam THEN ROAM.

hmau7nr,mediocrity_defined,11/27/2021,1,32.0,Riot did it with all of their scenes.  Dynasties and dystopia with jinx vs ekko  Snakes with vi and jayce  When everything went wrong with vi and sevika  Goodbye with end of act 1  Just because one wasnt received well doesnt mean the concept wasnt good. All of the above scenes were greatly improved with the music
hm9zhxa,delahunt,11/27/2021,1,12378.0,I mean barring a retcon Vi has amnesia and doesnt even know Jinx is her sister. Jinx then starts going around again as X causing crimes and focusing on Vi a lot.

hm9d286,H4SK1,11/27/2021,1,14.0,Strongly disagree. Vex passive was down. Kayn didnt have form yet. They legit have only Yasuo q as cc. Basically they need Azir to not be able to r and Rakan fail r into w combo to win that fight. I would say the risk is way too high and not worth it here. Just play it a bit slower wait for vex passive up again and gwen to get there is much better.
hmcue6n,brokerZIP,11/27/2021,1,2.0,You arent supposed to 1v1 a tank. If you got caugh by out of vision Zac E then its not tanks being broken. its you walking around as a squishy adc without vision/team. Also you dont have any antiheal Vs him illaoi akali and shieldbow Ashe. Not to mention that Zac is so ahead.

hmbpre9,Love--Yours,11/27/2021,1,4.0,Well I can’t speak for everyone other than Riot kinda made flex into what it is that way. Personally normal blind & draft are just too easy with the skill disparity. If I want something with a serious tone but not really I will pay ranked flex. It’s probably a lot worse right now because it’s preseason and the state of the world. Also a higher probability of trolling because premades.

How about not speaking about what others might think and speak for yourself then maybe people with fame can have more privacy and media dont get as horny to get your attention.
hmahaf8,hvngpham002,11/27/2021,1,87.0,I am for one extremely hype. Zoom - Knight - JKL on form is the best trident the LPL can offer from 2020 onwards.

Ahri was also more mainstream before Akali.  Akali also was just 1 part of kda but her stans acting like she became a mainstream star.
hmb72as,roadnot_taken,11/27/2021,1,264.0,Anyone thinking ADC isnt the strongest role right now next to a few tanks like Warwic Trundle and Mundo is nuts. Pretty much anything that can stack 4k HP and deal high damage. ADC is super reliable better itemization than ever and has so many life saving mechanics its crazy.

Dumping so much money into mana that you wont need with manaflow and passive when the money could be spent on defences for your shield that you innately have has felt better in my testing. But for champions without shields it might work better.

hmaqkm5,OvOxxx,11/27/2021,1,392.0,I mean isnt the gravity of the situation clear? Upsets biggest goal has always been worlds to prove himself but was always denied. Hell not even staying to play the first game against Deft and then leave should be enough reason to understand the situation Hylli and Yamato did. And the way Yamato speaks about it tells you its something painful. Upset did also tell his teammates well in advanced that there was family issues that could lead to an emergency.  We all react different and feel entitled more or less Bwipo and Adam is more(maybe nisqy) the rest it less.  Fnatic org knows and understands which should tell you alot they need to keep making the brand bigger and leaving the pinnacle of the year does not fly if its nothing of great importance.  Teammates where informed but the details or the lack of was not enough for some. Bwipo was probably out anyway and Rookie Adam got offended by Fnatic wanting arguably the best toplaner EU has produced. Nisqy got the short end if this which is sad.

Outside of C9 in the Summer 2013 promotion most Challenger teams that came up got sent back down within a year or even within one split. While the big-name teams like DIG CLG and Curse often ended up there they(except for DIG) always managed to regain their spot and continue as usual.

hm9pvoz,dystopi4,11/27/2021,1,41.0,100ish ping is more in the ballpark. I get 120ms to NA server from Finland.
hm8xpkn,Kripox,11/27/2021,1,322.0,If its a recent transfer its just smurf queue. I always play on the same account but something as simple as switching from normals to ranked towards the end of the season to get my season rewards results in immediate trash tier games. When I started playing ranjed this year I had afk’ers in my team 5 games in a row shit was nuts. However after playing for long enough the matchmaking eventually sorted itself out the games became bearable and I could actually play properly again.
hmcldkw,Konekewa,11/27/2021,1,103.0,Lux Morgana Seraphine
hmd2xem,IlDaydreamIl,11/27/2021,1,29.0,Mostly I didnt go for shieldbow and similars because my teammates protected me enough in the early teamfights. I ended up dying most teamfights but it was usually at the end of the teamfights and my team cleaned up the remaining enemies. But I just found this particular situation at one point in the game and after seeing stuff like this with tanks in a lot of past games I decided to open this discussion.  I agree that with adc you really need your team to help you and peel but Ive faced similar problems with some mages too. (Against tanks I mean) Its kinda frustrating most of the time tbh...
hmbyqz1,acesently,11/27/2021,1,48.0,It all comes down on how you deliver your point across. Maybe the manner in which he delivered it was not motivational.
hmcfcy9,Oreo-and-Fly,11/27/2021,1,102.0,What indicator.
hmcyg4d,FatPigsExtreme,11/27/2021,1,128.0,Okay so basically the only thing axiom arc did in this fight was make your ult come back up after you missed your E ult combo (which was unnecessary to begin with you coulda just E flashed or coinflip a hook). This play was nice but axiom arc did basically nothing so I don’t get the title
hmb97ax,WaraWare,11/27/2021,1,626.0,Thanks! Ill try him out!
hmd9347,Zorrodx,11/27/2021,1,535.0,GP mid enjoyer? Instant plat. If you played GP top and Irelia Top I’d guess Diamond but the Ahri makes you look worse. So I’ll guess gold
hm9wviu,That_Leetri_Guy,11/27/2021,1,425.0,Fellow Swede started playing on EUNE in season 2 but changed to EUW in season... 3 or 4 I wanna say. The match quality was just so bad and people would just talk in Polish or Russian instead of English so I couldnt coordinate with the team at all.
hmbwrdw,mystireon,11/27/2021,1,12.0,Dont forget the man also made Ekko so like almost half of all the champions featured in Arcane are his creations lol
hmbqk7r,DHSUAUGEV,11/27/2021,1,326.0,The biggest adc killer was 8.11. in 8.11 they fucked over adc stats super hard. They ruined their early game for that item update that was supposed to give them a really good late that they could never achieve since their stats were so bad. The only adc they didnt touch was Quinn because they obviously forgot since she doesnt play bot lane. Every adc was terrible after that but not Quinn.   Quinn was playing bot and beating everyone. Even the mages that replaced bot for that season. She was able to actually make it out of the early game and get to these new Great late game crit items. She was nerfed a patch or two later I dont remember.   After these stat nerfs as well adcs got replaced by mages. Riot then said they intended for that to be a thing to create more diversity. Which makes no since most adcs except for vayne and Lucian cant solo lane. So adcs were literally not picked ever. So they were obviously lying so they didnt have to go back on the adc update  Along with these stat nerfs adcs lost a lot of early agency as well (part of the reason mages replaced them) and the laning relies more on your support than ever.   Then I think the next pre season they kicked them while they were already down and did the DUO LANE XP NERFS. earlier they made it so adcs need levels to scale and then they made it even harder to get levels.   Now here we are with adcs being super mediocre. They can be pretty good if the adc and support have synergy otherwise you are just something to kill.   As well as this cringe ass crown item thats being abused in all 3 lanes.
hmd9uxr,vegeful,11/27/2021,1,277.0,You know what bad about this? It put so much pressure for jg to get thr dragon soul. Jg role must be someone with infinite willpower. So much job lol.
hm9605l,venomstrike31,11/27/2021,1,23.0,thats marked as a bug on the wiki
hmc6zwm,DGORyan,11/27/2021,1,,That wasnt even Nasus choice though. Renekton told him to do so as it was the only way to deal with Xerath. A hard choice but not a wrong one.
hm95jp9,Reddit12btw,11/27/2021,1,153.0,Perkz didnt seem to enjoy his millions of dollars that much.  Feels like broxah would do much better staying in EU abbedagge got into 100t because schalke imploded and I doubt zven is making millions.
hm9xm17,piotrj3,11/27/2021,1,,Who is becomming better? Because outside of Jinx not a single one is doing better using it.  Kogmaw has small drop in winrate since new LT is introduced and he is almost perfect champion to use it and still all ADCs have higher winrates with PTA/HoB with small exception of Jinx.
hmalyas,CudaBarry,11/27/2021,1,98.0,Nuguri really did a Gareth bale
hmawucc,kiiyopta,11/27/2021,1,9.0,Oh yes I definitely agree. I’ve blocked so many toxic people so now my league is only full of nice guys but riot literally doesn’t care
hm98qxj,ThatTeapot,11/27/2021,1,6.0,Mid can be really influencial if you are good at it
hmd3zfq,Somebodys,11/27/2021,1,569.0,Basically this. Ryze doesnt care so much who/what controls Runeterra so much as Runeterra doesnt go boom.   Also Yorick got done dirty by that event.
hmbaf9r,HaakonRDT,11/27/2021,1,1547.0,He is legit to ask for answers but he should NEVER get them. Upsets private situation is his private situation fnatic has no right to reveal that stuff for anybody else. Its a teammate its a janitor or Arnold fckng Schwazenegger - they all are equally randoms.  And even if they did tell him what the F does it change? Does it get easier to upset? Do they get to play worlds differently? No. So F that approach that he should know something.  Especially now no one should EVER tell him shit if he is so trigger happy to post twitlongers about anything that is going on involving any of his teammates. None of his future colleagues should ever reveal him any private stuff.  He wasnt told gf felt bad he was told it is serious family emergency Upset said it look at Yamato video about the situation nowhere it is Fing addressed as gf felt bad what is it middleschool? Adam came to these conclusions of his own (as he explicitly states in his twitlonger) because nobody gave him answers that he is not entitled to.  Somehow not knowing anything more is good for 8 year veteran Hyllisang who is happy to keep playing with upset but not for 19 year old barbie.  But Adam is Young and stupid he can learn and grow out of this shit might have a bright future.  Bwipos case is inexcusable. He basically threw his whole team under the bus to make some kind of apology/endorsement statement. Implying none of his teammates or his coach could do anything to get environment better other than his super duper GF.  F that shit good player too bad he left his brains in someone elses vagina.  Regarding his replacement talks everything was done appropriately. No one has to tell anyone shit. He can go and be mad but it is not in my interest to tell him anything and I wont. Humanoid decided to leave on his own way before the anouncement.  Unless You think that in some kind of Fd up world Mad Lions or any other org would actually replace the #1 current midlaner in LEC with a fckng random rookie? :D   Noone gives a F about how well reeker played in inferior league when Humanoid is dominating LEC. Mad had no choice.
hmalzbk,AgentSpott,11/27/2021,1,10.0,i dont think you get free trial on one card even if you do they will literally block your card forever
hmb8lsr,CarefulConsequence2,11/27/2021,1,31.0,This is one of the reasons why Ive considered her to main her. As an Annie main her E is so bothersome in lane cannot dodge it whatsoever! I think thats how they can win lanes easily whether in the mid or in the support role. Oh and did I mention her ulti comes back every 30 seconds? :P Shes definitely in a very strong position right now but yeah her E makes her hard to play. I think if you are facing her as a support it might be best to bring guardian as a rune and build mr early. That could definitely help at least in the early game imo.
hmd68mb,Bhiggsb,11/27/2021,1,,You say that but worlds is a fucking hard tournament. Na usually doesnt get easy groups.
hm9wtmh,fojek17,11/27/2021,1,7.0,Actually its bugged in this patch and the button doesnt show so its you who is dumb.
hmchay3,PMMeRule34Pls,11/27/2021,1,,Fun to brag to people for sure thats the main value.
hmcpilx,ApplePitou,11/27/2021,1,3.0,Getting a better rank in Preseason will improve your placement situation :3
hmb34jq,Garborge,11/27/2021,1,208.0,Seconding doomed.   Not because he can’t learn or something like that but because after thousands of ranked games in bronze he clearly has a *view* of what the game is.   You don’t play that many games per season unless you’re addicted or really enjoy the game and there’s a chance OP’s friend wouldn’t even enjoy playing higher Elo matches. In the low depths of bronze league is a team deathmatch game. That can be pretty cool if you’re into it.
hman2kl,TheOneAtomsk,11/27/2021,1,25.0,New to the game not because of Arcane though. How do yall handle all this item info like holy cow.
hmbqdju,DupreeWasTaken,11/27/2021,1,326.0,You would think its great... but it really doesnt feel all that great tbh.   Talking from a kindred OTP basically though the stats feel like such absolute shit compared to Conq or even PTA that it just doesnt feel right. And Kindred essentially has an auto reset on a low CD they should stack it quickly but it just doesnt feel good.   Kindred should feel good with that extra range with stacks too. But again numbers are just shit.
hmc8439,StaticallyTypoed,11/27/2021,1,68.0,> Singed isnt evil he just doesnt really believe in ethics. [...] Morally bankrupt =/= evil  ... What? I am baffled you could arrive at that. How on earth would you define evil if not by morals? The textbook definition of evil is quite literally morally bad
hm9jsfr,psfrtps,11/27/2021,1,396.0,No thank you. I dont want EUNE players on my server
hmcuv85,I_Dont_Group,11/27/2021,1,93.0,Hmm Im not the same guy but its actually an interesting question. A good analogy would be: are you anti-god if you dont believe in god? Not necessarily because if someone were to prove gods existence to you you could be pro-god. In the same sense not believing in ethics doesnt necessarily make you evil right?   It doesnt necessarily have to be about belief either. Does ignorance also equate to a negative? Would somebody ignorant of systems of government necessarily be an anarchist?
hmbgrlw,Zyralan,11/27/2021,1,52.0,Theres a reason I permaban Pyke these days.
hm998g6,DuckWasTaken,11/27/2021,1,191.0,Everyone can become better at league but it requires consistent focused attempts to improve to actually see change. You need to literally study the game to get truly better. Your friend despite what he says is not likely trying in the right way. If all he does is play without getting better its because he isnt deliberate about the cycle of learning and improvement.
hm97wsj,alpacamegafan,11/27/2021,1,,Kezman though… Would I trust that man to lead young talent and be able to develop them successfully?
hm9a4f8,Raynar7,11/27/2021,1,346.0,Of course. All native Kurwa users (a lot of them) know them. Kurwa is not simple word.   You have angry Kurwa surprised Kurwa Good job Kurwa sad Kurwa and many others

hmb9dc2,CarefulConsequence2,11/27/2021,1,8.0,The only champ that I know how to play a bit better than average against is Zed. I usually go against him in lane with Annie. What I do is I try to rush Zhonyas so when he presses R I can just Zhonyas and doesnt do any damage when it goes off. I also make sure to stay a distance because what Zed really wants to cause tons of damage to you is be close to you especially with his shadow.  You could also play champs that counter Zed. Vlad could be an option. Not only can you press your W to dodge his R when Zed goes all in but if you have Zhonyas too that could also be useful. For me as an Annie player its always been about sustaining against Zed till I become powerful enough to burst him with Tibbers. Good luck!
hmaevg0,Sonder332,11/27/2021,1,,lmfao call me when Blaber wins worlds.
hm9fw7c,Althalus-,11/27/2021,1,247.0,Maybe so but you did remind me to go rewatch that video partly for the nostalgia of how ugly old league was but also just for the running commentary of ‘aggressively walking towards the enemy’ lol.   Thing is with Evenshroud Leona is fucking terrifying right now. Much scarier than the adc….for at least 10-12 minutes.

hmb3eog,Lvl100Karp,11/27/2021,1,402.0,Wait..  You think its nice that hyli trusts Upset so much that he shouldnt want to know what happened but Upset doesnt trust Adam to understand the reasoning behind his dissappearance and hence not wanting to tell him. Then gets angry because Adam airs it out?..  Dont you think telling Adam would change how Adam viewed the situation? In Adams eyes upset left for whatever reason --> then tried to get him kicked off because he didnt aspire to reach as high as Upset.  What is this mental gymnastics?  Saying Adam invites people to harass Upset and his wife is just plain wrong and youre now inviting people to harass Adam using your logic no?

hm8vca5,JedstarRomero17,11/27/2021,1,10.0,It is always better for the carry role to get the gold. Especially adc which needs the most gold. Giving kills can get very risky though so only when it is absolutely guaranteed the carry can get the kill should the support stop hitting.

hm9i7qt,Rokuzan,11/27/2021,1,13.0,Debatable. Yone e duration should extend until Camille R ends but on the other side Yones e makes him immune to cc while he flies back. I would vote for a bug
hmaesuu,azurecactus,11/27/2021,1,,TheShy could still speak basic (although accented) Chinese to his teammates tho. Like I remember he asked Jackeylove in a mic check way before worlds if he could take the red buff and other simple game stuff as well.
hmch2ei,Far-Abroad8185,11/27/2021,1,22.0,If she has the gauntlets sett gets nuclear oneshotted  Without the gauntlets it probably goes either way tbh sett *looks* stronger but vi oneshotted urgot without the gauntlets so shes clearly not normal also.

hm95xqr,Terozu,11/27/2021,1,98.0,He didnt say they werent interested in women he said it was mostly Vi hitting on Cait.  And it was.  Cait very clearly is pretty naive in the romance department and it shows.  Id say Vi had a thing for Cait and Cait was trying to figure out how to build her thing for Vi.
hmcfh15,LeatherBodybuilder,11/27/2021,1,286.0,China is like 90% of LoLs playerbase. What braindead company wouldnt try to cater towards their largest demographic?   Should make up companies give shit about what teenage boys want? Should expensive clothing companies give a shit about what clothing low income people wants?  Riot already said that they arent doing winter maps anymore due to elemental rift. Theres a reason why the winter map wasnt even enabled in Ranked last time it was live. It takes too much effort to make it viable for Ranked.   Have you even played ARAM before? There are certain skins and ability that are straight up way to win in ARAM like pretty much every single winter/christmas skin with white VFX. The Orianna skins ball is almost invisible unless youre staring right at it.

hmbwx7i,BulletCola,11/27/2021,1,11.0,So Rengar isn’t a monster champ then? Despite him being included as one when people discuss monster champs.  Same with Alistar Ornn and Volibear as well.  It doesn’t have to deliberately mean “monster” in a literal sense.

hmaassb,TuxSH,11/27/2021,1,26.0,What actually happens from what I can see is that you win a fight and take a bountied Baron Nashor: thats a 500-800 bounty on top of the 1500 gold value in other words: an increase from 33.3 to 53.3% in value. That or you can maybe sneak it in case of jungle diff.  Then if objective bounties are still not deactivated (especially before the two hotfixes) you take bountied turrets with the baron buff cashing in even more gold. Objective bounties cant be disabled when attacking any bountied objective.  That and even enemies that are very behind can problematic if they decide to do an hail mary and splitpush for bounties.

You say they have but in the documentary i dont see anything special compare to EDG atmosphere it’s just so different EDG also has their problem and worked their ass off to make the roster work check their documentary and see how much effort they put compare to FPX.

hmbklt1,zok72,11/27/2021,1,156.0,Wizards that powerful are rarely the main character. Often they help the main character on their quest (in the style of Gandalf). I would say the main character(s) are confident but relatable teenagers or young adults who go on quests. Ekko Ezreal Ashe Katarina Lux Garen Yasuo Taliyah and Riven seem like the main characters of LoL.

hmcjf1j,SlakingSWAG,11/27/2021,1,435.0,They still have a harder time stacking it compared to a ranged champ. Being at ranged is an inherent defensive advantage and allows you to more safely stack LT. A melee champ stacking it is always going to be in a risky position because it means that they are smacking someone who may be capable of beating their shit in.   The champs you listed have an easier time stacking it but only relative to other melee champs. A few exceptions dont disprove the rule melee champs have a harder and less safe time stacking LT compared to ranged champs.

But I think a personal matter is more important than competition at any time and yes it would be nice to know what it all was about so we all can go Ooooh thats why he went home okay I get it now. I dont think one simply take a decision so lightly.

hmbwetv,Xonra,11/27/2021,1,196.0,Yeah its pretty busted once someone gets it. Nothing is as frustrating as finally getting that come back team fight against a team thats ahead...oh wait fuck me I guess nevermind they aced us cause they got to basically have a temp GA.  It definitely needs a fairly long cooldown.  Not to mention the fact that the actual buff you get is just wtf and the map change is just fucking annoying for literally everyone. Its a terrible edition on every single level.

I used to be single digit body fat and even though I was very strong for my size Id get pushed around standing up because I just dont have the weight to throw around. But when youre on th ground or against a hard surface you have something to push against for leverage and you can use technique leverage and your actual strength much better on the ground.

hmakybu,Reiir,11/27/2021,1,376.0,On the contrary lol. Life fucking happens even if  league is a game for us its a job for them - many of the players gave up on their studies/regular jobs in pursuit of a career in esports. Adam is a rookie who could make a name for himself on the biggest stage in his rookie year Nisqy was working on his redemption story after going to NA and being mediocre. Its their livelihood not just a random event they get to attend however many times they want. Adam might never be able to attend again.   But yes call me a child because I think career is more important than a wife feeling lonely.

hmboevp,PaulTheIII,11/27/2021,1,12.0,lol you can delay them feeding before you get enough of a dragon/baron lead to close out the game. Dragon spawns every 5 minutes. Everytime it does they can trade it for a turret. They would have already done that in the past and now they are getting rewarded extra for no reason imo  It’s better for the ahead team to get dragon instead of deny them the objective gold but the objective gold shouldn’t exist since *the better play* is to ignore that the enemy team is getting it. Dumb in terms of gameplay design since it’s giving ppl gold with no outplay or out macro. You can put effort in to get a pick on the person with a bounty this is just giving it to you for free

hmd1mos,IlDaydreamIl,11/27/2021,1,,Well excuse me for thinking that tanks are overtuned as fuck when every game I see tanks running down adcs and some times mages ignoring their dmg and killing them like they are nothing. Ive had games when Im going NORMAL in items (Not behind not ahead) with Kraken and LDR and literally autoattacking a tank over 5 times dont even take away 15% of their hp. Then they can run me down and kill me in seconds. What kind of joke is that exactly?  Dude its like we are not playing the same game. Ive played freaking Ornn Garen and Mundo sometimes and did exactly what Im saying here. Running towards an adc no matter if they are ahead or not and literally bashing their head into the ground while they cant escape or fight back.  Ive chased adcs that kited me pretty good and still reached them and fucking obliterated them with 1 combo of Garen Mundo Ornn Sion or any other tank. Ive played Hecarim with Sunderer and then full tank and took away 60% of an adcs HP with just Ghost and E. Ive also dived towers with the same Hecarim and took over 5 or 6 shots plus some dmg from the adc. And guess what? Ive killed him left and recalled without giving a single fuck about dmg.  I honestly dont understand how people can play some matches in this game and not see this kind of stuff. Am I really the only one? Seems like my matches are just special.
hm9z051,TheSoupKitchen,11/27/2021,1,53.0,Its always nice to read other ADC players express their frustration accurately.  I feel like I found a brother. :)  Its time to role swap. This season they literally gave every other role new items and runes to play with and ADCs ONLY GOT LETHAL TEMPO. Even if you look at it PURELY FROM AN ENTERTAINMENT PERSPECTIVE they gave every position something new and fun to experiment with and ADCs got fuck all. If you needed any more of a sign to change roles now is the time.   Just my word of advice. I wholeheartedly agree with you.  Of my 10+ years of adc. The last 3 years of ADC have been without a doubt the worst its ever been. And it seems to keep getting worse.

hm9aamr,magnetar2,11/27/2021,1,6.0,Youre right I didnt provide any context. This is what I sent to Riot: Three players in the enemy team were explicitly racist during an ARAM game. It started with player x (Olaf) using the N word in a disguised form to express in game frustration. I warned them in /all chat by stating Reported. Perhaps a bit childing of me but I wanted to know if it was intentional or not. x replied Snowflake. I admit I lost my temper and I dont mind taking accountability for bad language as long as they are held accountable for being openly racist in a multiplayer game. Then player y (Tristana) said (Olaf) wasnt racist by using the N word in reference to his opponents. At this point I was losing my temper because not only one person was openly racist but now two people were doing that so my language didnt get any better. Then player z (Twisted fate) threatened me to go to Belgium so he/she could change my mind about what was going on. At the end the enemy team won and x (Olaf) said Racism always wins.

hmbpcqb,plushrump,11/27/2021,1,170.0,Even at worlds you have games where one team gets dragon souls but the other team manages to come back and win the game. Feels like this is nigh impossible to do vs Chemtech because even if you win a fight the zombies will manage to get a few kills in return and you wont have anyone left to push towers with.    Had a game where enemy got Chemtech soul today. We swung gold on them twice with some good fights but couldnt end out the game since its so incredibly hard to do vs Chemtech soul.    Kill their squishy? Well they just revived and you gotta kill them again or let them do damage for free as their HP ticks down (nvm they have lifesteal lol). Kill a tank? Where here he is again to CC you to death.    Its just not fun to play against at all. All the old souls gave enemies a considerable buff (sans cloud) but they werent horrible to play against. Enemy does more damage/regens in fight/has a shield/is faster after ult is all  you could deal with. Literally being revived for a few seconds after death is not. All kills you get have to be picks and you have to back off right after. You will always lose a straight up teamfight vs Chemtech since youre effectively fighting 10 people.

hm9x8kz,howtopayherefor,11/27/2021,1,20.0,Theyre incentivized not to buy those items because thats wasted gold not because those items are inherently too strong for those champions. Would Vladimir with Liandrys be game-breaking? I mean he always bought the previous Liandrys so the concept of a DoT item on him isnt crazy.   For the following calculations lets assume 50% conversion rate.  * Frozen Heart has 400 mana which is equivalent to 560 gold. This is converted to 105 HP. So Frozen Heart on Garen would be 20 AH 105 HP and 80 armor. Randuins is 10 AH 250 HP and 80 armor. Is that gamebreaking? * Seraphs Embrace has 860 mana which is equivalent to 1204 gold. This is converted to 225 HP which would result in 80 AP and 475 HP. Rylais is 90 AP and 350 HP. Or we convert it to (860/21.75/2=) 20 AP for so Seraphs becomes 100 AP and 250 HP. Is that gamebreaking?  You say it completely breaks the balance of the game and invalidates the item system but you give zero arguments or explanations for why that would be the case. It only buffs resourceless champions by widening their item pool which in practice would mean Kennen might buy a mythic item with mana rather than being bound to mythic items without mana. To reiterate: there are barely any mana items anyway.

hmbux23,Sir_lordtwiggles,11/27/2021,1,175.0,Im glad I dont dev for q game company so I dont need to deal with coding takes this bad.  Here is the summary of why some bugs dont get fixed:  Payoff/(difficulty of fix * time to fix)  Your bug may be well documented but may take too long to refactor or the fix could be to risky and break 7 things down the line. Moreover if there is no substantial gameplay payoff compared to the time/effort invested compared to other bugs then you are scheduling your sprints poorly.  There is generally no specific bug fix team so the dev teams need to balance between repairing a game with rotten foundations or giving more content

hmcn64l,DANKKlNG,11/27/2021,1,653.0,Roam. Mid roams are op but also very difficult. Depending on your elo learn the following:  Jungler back times midlane wave management and botlane wave management.   You want to generally have the same back time as your jungler. This way you and him are on the map at the same time and can work together more. Back timers are very important jn general as good backing can increase your tempo.  Jungle clear patterns can tell you when yiur jungler is gonna be near you to make a play together (maybe a gank or invade play or just warding together for note safety). For this and mid roaming you need to learn to manage bot waves. Learn how to freeze. You cant always do this. But learn how the wave works and roam on a slow pushing wave towards you etc. Learn mid wave management to learn when you should gank. Not knowing that your mid is slowpushing and then sitting in the bush for 10 sec taking his exp is gonna put you both behind. While knowing when the wave is pushing to you laner and ganking then means that you are fast and efficient.   Dont try to learn everything at the same time. Apply one concept untill you are good enough at it and then move to the next.

hmd2bjq,My_Audience_Awaits,11/27/2021,1,,Better be fast when your name is the fast.
hmd34st,Hazuyu_,11/27/2021,1,,If you watched LCS youd know that Sven wasnt a top player anymore this year. Doesnt surprise that hes teamless actually. Contractz was arguably better even in a short game time sample.

hmc6rzv,anupsetzombie,11/27/2021,1,14.0,Wait so the ascended pantheon skin etc will be available at the end of the year? Will just wait and decide between Kayn and Voli if thats the case.
hmc0ukk,TheWorldisFullofWar,11/27/2021,1,12.0,It is the playerbases fault. People are still spending money on League despite Riot significantly cutting back on the budget for the game itself and instead investing it elsewhere. So the players have voted that they dont want events like Odyssey or Star Guardian. They dont want alternate maps.
hma4t5q,tanezuki,11/27/2021,1,76.0,I agree with how stupidly easy itd make the Vanguards apply it. Though ADCs can also apply it very easily (3 aas with Mortal Reminder ?).  Then how about just keeping the first condition  of 40% and adding a 50% max HP threshold like Morello or Chempunk instead of the CC condition.
hmcm1d0,elderscroll_dot_pdf,11/27/2021,1,,We dont know almost anything about when Arcane is supposed to be taking place and theyve stated that it diverges from the existing lore in certain places to keep the stories in the show chronologically sychronized even though the existing lore has them far less interconnected (unless its been changed lately). Also its highly likely that Noxus has not invaded Ionia in the timeline of Arcane seems like something that would have been mentioned in one of the Council scenes at least off-handedly.
hmcs3i0,Samlibardi,11/27/2021,1,,Well they only said it was already in production and said it was not coming in 2022. It is a hell of a lot of hopium but maybe just maybe.
hm9bq2g,RoboModeTrip,11/27/2021,1,51.0,Not enough crazy.

hmaktui,The_Cool_Mule,11/27/2021,1,81.0,Did you see Core last split and at worlds??? I feel like people are still stuck in thinking of Core in his early years but his recent performances dont justify that.
hmawjyg,chinolito,11/27/2021,1,6.0,Is KDA stuff considered cosplay?
hma645j,Querccias,11/27/2021,1,41.0,Youre right. But why are you on the other side of the world while your team entire team is mid trying to siege with Baron at 45 minutes.
hmb5ons,The_Cool_Mule,11/27/2021,1,26.0,I read through what you said three times and I still cant figure out what triggered that person lol
hmd8bsh,thefirstbelmont86,11/27/2021,1,4.0,Yeah but yet they want to keep the community tox free... I miss the forums where other players could carry out justice
hmb3o6g,mrslakes,11/27/2021,1,26.0,But I just did though. So deal with it. The faker worship on the is sub is giga cringe.

hmd22v2,crunchyball,11/27/2021,1,78.0,He can’t even legally play in the LCS for a couple of years which is a lot of time for development.

hmd84p5,JedstarRomero17,11/27/2021,1,170.0,All you need to win the NA title is Doublelift. So I fully agree.
hm9f2n9,Caenen_,11/27/2021,1,26.0,WW Q has received a bunch of bandaids to other bugs that just overall make it all the more inconsistent and buggy.
hmcam6u,gothsole,11/27/2021,1,1.0,pretty interesting if its legit. i doubt its an act 4 but it might be promotional material or another teaser (since they apparently knew they were getting season 2 early on in production)  have any other streamers/youtubers talked about it?
hmcqu7e,PossibleJealous2293,11/27/2021,1,66.0,Too many champs to choose from tbh. Meta changes every now and then so.oicming what you enjoy over what is good is probably better. If you play top and like bruisers/tanks try these:  Camille Jax Sett Ornn
hm9jll8,HorrowLP,11/27/2021,1,256.0,Use Mute All lol.  Your team 99 times out of 100 often dont contribute anything meaningful in chat anyway. Plus this forces you to become more aware so that you can not who is MIA and where they were last seen.
hmd8qmz,RaidWolf,11/27/2021,1,6.0,Got it
hmd3g4b,dawnzyolo,11/27/2021,1,127.0,That team would be top 3 imo.
hmacalb,Hazakurain,11/27/2021,1,52.0,But he did already. He has nothing to prove.
hmbbo6h,khazixian,11/27/2021,1,11.0,I have met many people who buy accounts purely for backups and alts for friends and ranked offpicks.   When you can get a ranked ready 15000 BE account for 4 dollars in less than 20 minutes it becomes super common real quick.
hmcwd63,CuteTao,11/27/2021,1,2.0,Theyre planning to get rid of gemstones I thought

hmcdukw,ArchMageMagnus,11/27/2021,1,69.0,Anymore suggestions? Ive just started playing him and ironically I really like him even though I generally like more skill shot and harder to play champs. Stat champs like him and Jax Ive actually taken a liking too recently. I actually just played a game with him using Tempo and won. I usually go Phase or Predator.
hmc25jz,BloodSurgery,11/27/2021,1,373.0,Yeah but now its even worse lmao now he doesnt go limp after doing E AA AA  some champs could beat him after that but now he just breaks right click and wins extended trades.
hmdaqnn,jkeller11,11/27/2021,1,6.0,Bro they ain’t gonna kill off people like cait jinx and vi in the first season 😂

hmcq873,elvarien,11/27/2021,1,,No both jinx and Harley were both based around tank girl. Old comic and movie.
hmaag0f,NumbEffect,11/27/2021,1,311.0,He doesn’t have to be specific on details but if he properly conveys the gravity of the situation then I’m sure there would be understanding from all parties involved. Clearly is there is this much animosity from some people that wasn’t done whatsoever.
hm9gnh9,Imagurlgamur,11/27/2021,1,33.0,I cant believe DL is playing with diamond after calling him platinum for an entire split during watch parties lol
hmajwcv,Kakolokiya,11/27/2021,1,115.0,Don’t forget about Xayah switching her itemization to lethality and becoming one of the most broken adcs ever. Nerfed back to crit? Mediocre once more.
hm9spv8,JohnGaltMorreuBabaca,11/27/2021,1,62.0,But hey rioters commented on a bug thread! Theyre are so inclusive arent they? What a nice company that cares about us.    Lets see how many interact now.    Either way its summer.
hmd8cog,Kepazhe,11/27/2021,1,329.0,oooh yeah. even then one of the maps has better trees (immortal gardens) but people dont use it for that really
hmblf71,KenDawg25,11/27/2021,1,6.0,Thanks
hmd8u8z,zinodyta1,11/27/2021,1,170.0,Given that worlds just had record high viewer counts I think its a bit pre-mature to say that. My take on the scenario is that we are seeing a transition where pro-level players are increasing and finances are stabilizing resulting in shifts in the player attendence something to be expected due to Leagues age. There are too many players and too few pro spots.

hmcq1gz,puffoberto,11/27/2021,1,7.0,I mean the point of aram is the randomness of the composition and the way to work around in a constant team fight scenario even if it means the outcome wont be good 50% of the time. If it helps you then you should play it way less than you do rn
hmcbka3,SW_foo1245,11/27/2021,1,345.0,Kat dancing  was the best.

hmaecx6,LunaLance_,11/27/2021,1,441.0,Why are so many people concerned with her breasts?? Thats a fucking odd gate to keep.
hmbypin,King_marik,11/27/2021,1,214.0,Its absolutely an insane mechanic. Put it on elder at least how is this in line with the other souls?  Sadly though the real question is how does the east feel about it? Cause on reddit its pretty clear EU and NA dont seem to like it but all that really matters is what China thinks.  And Im not fully blaming them for that. Cater to your big market 100% get it. But yeah if China likes it they wont change it at all.

hmbpcr5,dystariel,11/27/2021,1,569.0,The ability to use reality warping magic would devalue her prowess as a duelist.  Suddenly shes not a great duelist anymore but a total moron for not just reality warping her enemies to death with OP magic bullshit.  What makes her awesome is that she can hold her own in a world full of Magic by just being THAT good at her craft.  Nevermind what demacia would do if they figured out that their grand duelist is a literal mage who can materialise entire buildings out of thin air.  The power fantasy here is outskilling raw power disadvantages.
hmby449,BeastSG,11/27/2021,1,196.0,Its really this simple.  Theres no need to get into the weeds and statistics about how balanced it is.  Games are supposed to be fun.  Chemtech soul is not fun. Get it out.

hmbqxdt,DupreeWasTaken,11/27/2021,1,326.0,I actually dont agree with that Now do I think The new ult item is a good idea? No. But I do think Assasin items needed some changes. Yes.   And I dont play assasins. But its pretty telling that all the broken assasins of last season werent actually building assassin items.   It was goredrinker and conqueror.    Those items needed to be tuned but even after - the numbers werent there for Talon Qiyana etc
hmak9xa,JesiAsh,11/27/2021,1,12.0,Does not mean anything. Arcane is not confirmed to be canon and Vander is not confirmed to be Warwick... and if he is then he will be alive  🤦🤦‍♂️

hmbut9z,KnockoutRoundabout,11/27/2021,1,7747.0,It’s seriously such a well done show it’s insane. Vi and Powder are kids with problems wanting to do what they think is right occasionally losing themselves to their emotions and it ends up blowing up in their faces in the worst way possible. Their dad is dead their friends/adopted brothers are dead and now a misunderstanding beyond either of their control has ruined their relationship and separated them.  This show is depressing af and I love it.
hmcmcfp,Windred_Kindred,11/27/2021,1,34.0,How do you think he became the boss of a fighting ring which he participated before in without ever training to actually fight ?
hmbam62,CreepyMosquitoEater,11/27/2021,1,264.0,I dont know who that is but every yasuo ive seen do well recently has taken it. For reference i am diamond so not high elo but i can tell you its working extremely well at my level and below and that is where the vast majority of players play
hmd6pon,-Reddit_Account-,11/27/2021,1,72.0,Just play Mecha Zero Sion and this is pretty much what his ult does
hmb9uwi,daswef2,11/27/2021,1,,>sup leave the ad on an island since everyone has pretty much figured out how useless an adc gets without solo exp and island farming and yuumi can just attach to someone else (jg most of time)  This kinda reminds me a little bit of ardent meta where getting enchanters big is probably more important than getting your adc ahead.  What ive seen a lot of is enchanters sitting in lanes trying to scale and then tank supports heavy roaming because the 2v2 has no kill pressure against enchanters.
hmaxar3,Sonder332,11/27/2021,1,8.0,Thats a lot though. Who else has impacted so many characters? mmm Viego? Maybe Swain?
hmba4dk,Zirofal,11/27/2021,1,9.0,Noxus in a nation that values strength and had a strong culture that reflects that. Where everyone is equal and everyone can excel and reach their goal. No matter their sex political opinion race magic or whatever. You just need to be strong enough to achieve it. This does not mean you most be a powerful soldier. Its about strength in what you do. Be it a chef a painter a musician or a soldier. Yes on top of that theirs also a harsh war culture that comes from long years of expansionism and they have often gone to war with other nations like most recently Ionia. But this is also partially due to the harsh land of noxus where few crops can grow very little is able to live so they have been forced to invade other kingdoms to survive.  Furthermore one of the three leaders is actively trying to work against preventing the void from growing to powerful.
hmb5opv,aNumberFiveLarge,11/27/2021,1,530.0,The little scenes really did it for me in particular - Jinx when Silco is telling her that enforcers are dead and shes just *slighly* increasing her smile and slightly nodding and then later on when Ekko taunts her into a duel with his stopwatch for those brief 1.5secs you can see her look at him look at stopwatch look back at him and scowl in disbelief animations truly were out of this world.  Hope they keep the quality for S2. Well they kinda *need* to otherwise their show will get butchered the same way One Punch Man season 2 was butchered you cant deliver greatness and then underdeliver later on.

hmccdke,Excalidorito,11/27/2021,1,,I mean it’s not mutually exclusive for this to be the case. In fact before Rocketbelt just got outright better stats than Nightharvester it seemed like a pattern for most mobility Mythics.  Rocketbelt Galeforce and Stridebreaker all had worse combat stats since the freecast mobility was so strong in their respective class. Only items I see breaking this pattern were Prowler’s when it gave 21 lethality and Chemtank/Battlesong since they were more MS steroids than dashes.

hm9ya86,Rexsaur,11/27/2021,1,53.0,old LT was better on like every adc except for like vayne (mainly because old LT was garbage on vayne).
hmbh36c,RobbinDeBank,11/27/2021,1,,I guess you’re the annoying one here. Faker is loved universally by almost everyone that follows league esports. You see people with flairs of all different teams praising Faker. You see every pro mid laner says that their idol is Faker. But I guess you’re so superior “dUrR hUrR fAkEr bAd aNnOyInG fAn”

hmcw4m6,coolpizzacook,11/27/2021,1,128.0,So in this particular situation Serpents Fang would be good? Yet what if the enemy team was Mundo Olaf Zed Alistar and Tristana? Serpents Fang wouldnt be of much use then now would it?  Serpents Fang is a situational item just because its good in that circumstance proves that its situational more than it doesnt.

hm918lj,a_fucking_kiska,11/27/2021,1,485.0,mechanically a lot more skillshots game is based around teamfights when dota is more about tactics and thinking. Also league hero abilities are a lot less impactful in comparison to dota. One smart dota aoe initiation and 4v5 is won. lol lacks that. by so it means that a teamfight is won by coordination of all team. in dota one player can win the game in lol you cant. I like dota more.
hm8xrte,BBQMasterDad,11/27/2021,1,3.0,New Mundo just feels so much better to play. I think the W is ultimately “worse” (personal preference) but everything about his kit now feels so much smoother and his VFX update was phenomenal.
hm9dofw,ranolia,11/27/2021,1,46.0,No... In terms of esports in general they had idea about korean scene but the popularitt that faker brought in wqs never seen before
hmaqtkf,ImSoRude,11/27/2021,1,98.0,性格分别. I dont think its that Nuguri didnt want to try but he is too shy and introverted to easily assimilate into the environment. Viper is like the opposite plus Scout is there to carry the translation most of the way. I think maybe if they switch teams Viper can still succeed on FPX and Nuguri would have been able to find success on EDG because they were a more welcoming environment.
hmc13d3,Theio666,11/27/2021,1,24.0,Just learn to dodge spears instead of posting cringe here. Its not that hard.

hma8a4l,Skall77,11/27/2021,1,145.0,I dont often agree with Doublelift but he is 100% right here.   Upset telling he didnt trust his teamate was the first big red flag wtf you spend hours and hours with them playing a competitive team game and you dont trust them enough to tell them the reason you are ruinning one of the biggest moment of their life ? Who knows if Adam is gonna make world again.  Obviously family come first but it doesnt cost you anything to show your own teamate a bit of respect.
hmadj34,MantraDantra,11/27/2021,1,26.0,You were talking about pick rate and who was more niche. Obviously the champ thats in the TV show is gonna get a lot of play time rn lmao

hmbovto,DHSUAUGEV,11/27/2021,1,326.0,Thats because yasuo actually doesnt abuse lethal tempo. Yone does. But you literally just ignored everything he said because if yasuos winrate. He went into full detail about how they abuse adc items better than any adc could ever could. Its not as much a rant of yasuo and yone need to be nerfed I suck. But more of a yasuo and yone need to be changed so adcs can co exist with them.
hmcadhg,JohnCornewaille,11/27/2021,1,91.0,That should be explained by SoL event but maybe Vex did it? Yordle magic is very powerful and different I wouldnt rule it out but of course I much rather have the talented and experienced writers explain it than we having to guess it.

hmchle3,J-Hart,11/27/2021,1,,It was popular in an already niche community but its not like you ever hear people who arent already interested mention Akali.  Or any of them really.  Id say mainstream characters are more widely known.  Chun-Li Johnny Cage Mario Sonic... are a few mainstream game characters.  Riots fighting game might be an effort to push these characters more into mainstream territory since it tends to be a more approachable game genre.  Jinx probably has the most mainstream potential in LoL.  Behind her maybe Ekko?  Catchy names and cool designs and we know theyll both be in Project L.

hmcii1p,Naerlyn,11/27/2021,1,,Thats not true though.   Im making no comment on how minor they are / on whether theyre minor I just want to chime in on this very point.   One of the *minor* bugs of old Mordekaiser was also one of the most complicated and risky bugs to fix in the entirety of the game (as said by a dev).   It was that thing making it so that a Jhins ghost wouldnt lose bullets upon attacking (and could as such be stuck on the 4th bullet or permanently be locked out of 4th bullet). While it made for fancy videos that bug was in the end minor due to the number of conditions required for it to affect anything at all. Fixing it would have required rescripting Jhins passive entirely (and then tested it to ensure it wouldnt cause problems for Jhin for any of the interactions or for Jhins ghost).   On the other hand a literal gamebreaking bug (getting the ghost of an Ornn immediately crashes the game for all players in every case) had a straightforward fix (not using a new file type for Ornns audio / including a new sound type in what the ghost can return).
hmbzwfe,Youre_all_worthless,11/27/2021,1,373.0,So whys everyone taking it instead of conquerer like they did before?  Hasnt Jinx run conquerer for a long time now and now that LT is changed they run the new one?  That doesnt make sense to me
hmd0at5,ShadyGecko,11/27/2021,1,30.0,Thanks I missed it thought they didnt give one out.
hmdauk1,Braunze,11/27/2021,1,6.0,The actual league of legends arena lane fighting isnt cannon anymore.  Theres no reason why they couldnt kill them off and still exist in the game and just be legends.

hmbfzem,Head_Haunter,11/27/2021,1,303.0,Since the AS is gutted for ranged champions.... they should gut the flip out of the bonus attack range for melee champions. Theyre getting 90% attack speed just give them like 25 bonus attack range or something.
hmaz9zs,YoungAnimater35,11/27/2021,1,12.0,Thank you thats what I was thinking. Soul is a good reason to leave I guess if my team cant follow up then its a lost game no matter how many objectives I think will be beneficial in taking.

hm8ylvp,TheSoupKitchen,11/27/2021,1,29.0,Unrelated to the post about Evelynn. But Kindred will randomly appear in your lane or literally ON YOUR SCREEN when she ends up showing cross-map for a gank. I was scared half to death because I knew a Kindred was botside but she flashed in my lane for a fraction of a second and upon looking at the minimap she was ganking bot and was nowhere near top.  I know this is also a bit of a legacy bug I remember it happening a lot with Nidalee in some season way back (which has since been fixed).  Only noticed it with Kindred. Also wish I had proof or more extensive evidence to showcase it.   (EDIT: FWIW this issue seemed to be in the previous patch and I havent played against Kindred to notice it still happening.)

hmbirq9,KingFredo5674,11/27/2021,1,88.0,Old Jax lore was better and funnier imo. They literally had to nerf him and give him a lamppost to fight other champions because he was too broken with other real weapons.  Imagine if I had a real weapon I hope they never remove this line....
hmazrx2,TTUPhoenix,11/27/2021,1,,I think thats the reason for the big change in how tanks feel since the item rework even if theyre statistically doing well or at least okay.  In previous seasons that period from 1-3 items was where tanks where strongest because the carries were still getting their core items online and didnt have the ability to get serious penetration yet.  Mages had their mana item (maybe 2) then often wanted deathcap or needed morello while ADCs had IE/ER and then their zeal item.  Going pen before 3rd item was often not practical.  Now however void staff LDR and Seryldas are pretty viable as 2nd item on a lot of champions allowing them to enter the first big teamfights with penetration online.

hmapq6f,Pampss,11/27/2021,1,392.0,Based on what? If what Adam said was even close to the truth of it do you honestly believe Upset would not only be on the team next year but being consulted on who he wants to play with. FNC is a major organization with tens of millions of dollars being funneled in from fans investments and sponsorships every single year. If Upset had single-handedly ended FNCc world hopes without a valid reason Sam Mathews and the rest of the FNC ownership would be obligated to release Upset whether they wanted to or not.  The fact that the organization and Upset still have a working relationship is proof on its own that whatever reason Upset had to leave was a valid one. Forbes listed the organizations worth at 120 million Dollars. People still have these crazy notions that league teams are five friends playing for some mousemats. Businesses that deal in that amount of capital are held to far higher standards and expectations than anyone on this Subreddit gives them credit for why do you think Ocelotte has to explode his whole roster despite the players still clearly being very good.

If the other teammates are trying to make an effort to help Nuguri and he shuts them out its not their responsibility to go above and beyond to make him talk they also have a lot to worry about in practicing and maintaining their form.

hmcl3wr,2Teemos1Cup69,11/27/2021,1,440.0,> but i think jinx will be the first league character to break into mainstream media  This is the comment I quoted. Get Jinxed was a thing pretty much only league players enjoyed and Jinx Cosplays were popular yeah but thats hardly breaking into the mainstream. For reference KDA Akali related media hit the internet like god damned overwatch blender porn.   > Akali also was just 1 part of kda but her stans acting like she became a mainstream star.  I quite literally dont care about KDA but most people that didnt play league seemed to like her part the most. Dunno why youd take issue with this ig yall like to take issue with everything

hmb29kx,butthurt-fanboy,11/27/2021,1,12.0,Least: Every human champion with a normal weapon Caitlyn katarina yasuo fiora garen lux xin darius miss fortune   The design idea seemed like hmm lets make a character add a random weapon (normal gun dagger sword lance) and then give them random clothing a person with that weapon would wore.  The most creative imo is Fiddlesticks and kindred Fiddle is for his assimetric looks and the way hét moves just shows how much care it took to create and kindred for the lamb+wolf 2 in 1 design and the whole concept in general

hmb0h9i,Odd_Play_5769,11/27/2021,1,38.0,The broken thing about lord Dom is that I can stack the % hp dmg with cut down. How ridiculous is it that if Im an ADC with LDR and Cut-down I get to do 30% extra damage to you simply because youre a tank and built what youre supposed to lol. Not to mention the armor shred which is good against 3veryone and even as an ADC main I have to be honest the item is very overturned it should be situational if youre against a ton of tanks not must buy every game
hm9swbt,SlimLovin,11/27/2021,1,226.0,“Experimental?”  It couldn’t be more generic.
hm9d04c,aluxmain,11/27/2021,1,8.0,its not simple to genralize but usually if you got bot T1 tower (tier1/the first one) you want to move mid and thake their T1 also there then the top T1 then some T2 towers.  you want to get the most external tower first because its less risky you dont want to take T1->T2->T3 bot while T1 mid is still up.  since T3 towers (inibitor one) are easier for enemy team to defend you want to get baron to get those.  this doesnt mean that to win you should look to get every single existing tower i tried to generalize so try to take smart decisions.  usually to end the game you need to take at least 2 inibitors if you already got one is better to push another lane and get a second inibitor compared to just push the opened lane and hope to get nexus towers.  tip: after you get one tower your minions get a bit stronger so its easier to keep the lane pushed so you push a bit and move to another lane to take other objectivs.

hm9hr0t,Psyr1x,11/27/2021,1,14.0,At the moment its somewhat unlikely to be Corina... the only thing that would give a suggestion to Corina is that the character is rich and seemingly from Zaun... which many take to imply a chem baron.   Corinas not the only Chem Baron we know just the most forward facing living one atm (rip Silco) due to LoR.  The words used to tease the support do not align with Corinas personality nor do they in any way appeal to the core themes Corina has:  I.e. being a self-made woman and a woman who innovates her own experiments and designs.   There are zero puns that reference plants and flowers which are the prime identifier for Corina... Itd be odd to tease a champ and not make any reference to their major gimmicks and identifiers.  All in all it paints it as somewhat unlikely atm to be Corina.

hmbsjju,Public_Seaworthiness,11/27/2021,1,,you are the typical ignorant league player that doesnt want to accept the right answer. you rather be mad and in delusion blame everything else but your decisions ingame.  hope it works out for you if you act like that irl.  and wtf do you mean you were support. by the looks of it highlighted row and physical/true/magic/cc score stats you were playing twitch. my best guess. and if you really were support: your vision score is horrible. and how would a support reel in 200k total damage. you were killing waves left and right. not lasthitting tho otherwise easy s. learn to lasthit at least.  also convenient that you cropped it the way you did. so you can spin the story for others in a way you like and that would support your delusion. link the game.  &#x200B  looked it up myself  [https://eune.op.gg/summoner/userName=trias000](https://eune.op.gg/summoner/userName=trias000)  sivir. 4.9cs/min  i wAs sUpPoRt bTw  then act like one so the game registers you as one. the game thinks you are adc and having that cs count doesnt even qualify you for a bronze S grade.  but hey rather be mad instead of trying to understand the situation. clown.

hm9o4to,nyasiaa,11/27/2021,1,200.0,just taking an objective isnt really that useful because it really depends on all the timings and most of the time I *dont* want to take the tower too early because it just gives me no option to fast shove the wave and have it bounce back (which in turn makes geting frozen on a basically unfixable problem)  I cant take herald on my own and I *dont* even know what to do with the knowledge. I *know* have to look further into the future but its just too hard. Yes lee sin showed bot. Do I try to slow push now? Do I try to shove it super fast? At what time will the wave bounce back to me? At what time will the slow-push build and crash? I dont know any of these timings which combined with not knowing lee sins timings is basically as good as if I didnt know anything and all that is even excluding the fact that theres an opponent in my lane I have to take into account.  Things such as taking plates when I can are kinda obvious but often it turns out that this lee sin or whoever has taken a direct path from bot to top with no stops in between and arrived top lane before I recalled from taking all the plates and I die. Or a slow-push builds and lee and their top lane use the huge wave to dive me. None of these are gold level knowledge I didnt even use minimap while breezing through gold so I dont really believe people can do all that in there (otherwise I would be hard punished for my terrible decisions) in fact from my experience I doubt even anyone below high diamond starts doing these things correctly.

Hes just a brawler as far as I am aware.   He has big punches and stuff in game but I dont think in-game abilities necessarily translate to in-universe power. For example Katarina can blink in-game but I think thats just a proxy for her in-universe non-magic fighting you know? I view Sett the same way.

Glad you understand.  > If I were mad and you were to send other people over to harass me  Nobody did that here so another strawman. Shit Upset made it worse for himself to be honest. If his attempts to communicate with the team are as bad as those twitlongers you cna see exactly why this went to shit cant you? That was a fantastic advertizement from Upset not to play with him if thats what he calls good communication.
hm93e6a,TheAatroxMain,11/27/2021,1,136.0,Every single bruiser that can 1v2 ( Camille cant and Jax is a stretch ) except for fiora  Gwen and aatrox can only statcheck their way through  a.k.a. you simply dont learn anything about using lifesteal to push the limits and spacing to survive . You just all in and pray for the best . Besides  youre kinda changing the goalposts : first your issue was with clutching ( which is why I answered like this )  then it was 1v2s that you disagree with . These two arent the same  but Im assuming ( in good faith ) that youre talking about 1v2 clutches ( for 1v1 for example Gwen doesnt clutch as hard while kled is the best single champion for it ) .

hmaa1se,Umarill,11/27/2021,1,311.0,I said it on Upsets last post got downvoted for it.  This subreddit is purely moronic whoever speaks last changes the main narrative and others opinions are silenced through downvotes. Got piled on by people who told me I was wrong and that I was just defending Adam because he is French and that the French community is a cesspool that harasses Upset.

hmcwqsx,rickycarbonara,11/27/2021,1,660.0,Hey guys so Ive recently narrowed down my two main roles to Support and Jungle. When I first started out I grew to love top lane playing champions like Kayle Shen Malphite Kennen and Teemo. But as I progressed through the game I first fell in love with Support and recently Ive enjoyed playing Jungle. My question is as my champion pool is limited could I get recommendations for both Support and Jungle champions?  For Support I usually alternate between Swain and Rakan and for Jungle I usually play either Ivern or Trundle.  For Support Ive already tried Soraka shes okay not a massive fan Lulu Lux and Morgana same boat too. For Jungle Ive tried Master Yi Warwick and Nunu I dont mind playing either of them Udyr I find a bit lackluster and Evelynn Im not a massive fan of tbh.  I know its not much to go off but please throw any recommendations at me that you think Id enjoy!  Cheers! 😁
hmc24k3,TuxSH,11/27/2021,1,14.0,> or suicide your bounty to a support to take it off of you without helping the other team much  Doesnt that depend on the support?

The one that got flamed just afk-ed or inted even more. I then just took a long break from rank and started playing norms/draft/aram just for fun. I think a couple of days later SOMEHOW I joined our LoL discord and found there are some good groups looking for team mates at the same level. I found one good duo SO FAR. This is just my own experience and opinion.  If its frustrating and not fun for you atm then take a break and come back whenever you feel ready.

hmcee7p,BuilderHarm,11/27/2021,1,178.0,Kleds Q is also bugged I think theres something wrong with True Sight in general at the moment.
hmcsfvy,Sangreal11,11/27/2021,1,490.0,Yeah people sleep on Syndra. Unless they changed her lore they last time I read her potential was described as limitless. With training/meditation or whatever her powers could grow infinitely.

hmaamo1,Slygone,11/27/2021,1,313.0,People who said DL has no motivation or drive anymore need to be reminded of that fact. He found himself in one of the most dreadful situations in his life and went to win LCS finals while playing out of his mind.

hm97cid,WeirdChamp960,11/27/2021,1,4.0,I hope this never comes. Burnout already is a huge problem in esports. Mad didnt get a single break this entire year with worlds and MSI. If they also have to play a tournament in offseason because some fans are unpatient as fuck they would have no break ever. Thats basically the recipe for a guaranteed Burnout

hm9kgaf,CiastekBT,11/27/2021,1,130.0,+8 years? It has been said in the interview with Fortiche that Arcane has been in production for 6 years. These things dont suddenly pop out of apple trees.   In the end its more like Riot decided to wait 2 years to take the step towards Arcane.
hmc1cf3,TheSoupKitchen,11/27/2021,1,80.0,Except axiom arc is only good under the assumption you get kills with your first one and either thats it or you miss.  Youmuus movespeed is better. Clearing wards with umbral is better too.

hm90wqp,SexualHarassadar,11/27/2021,1,10.0,Only reason I got through it is because Riot said fuck it and made it so you could finish each region in 2-5 games instead of 20-50.

hmad4y6,Durris,11/27/2021,1,310.0,Everyone seems to keep missing the idea that if something happened to his wife he would be spending time with her. Playing games with her sounds like spending time with her. Im glad you were able to see that possibility.

hmagnrq,SP3EDI,11/27/2021,1,376.0,Why is that upsets fault that Adam and Nisqy where plain bad ? Bean the Sub ADC was looking pretty good. Upset did not stop them from playing at worlds. There are even freaking teams that need to field sub players from their rival teams because of visa issues and they show up and try the best. Why did Adam and Nisqy think they are entitled to just run it down and dont give their best at worlds and blame others for it because one player of the team did not attend ? Especially if the Sub in Bean was having a pretty good showing.
hmb97nw,Nameless_One_99,11/27/2021,1,163.0,Tian was the only person in FPX that made an effort to get close to him.             Viper in EDG had not only Meiko making a big effort but he had Scout whos also outgoing and helped Viper adjust to life in China EDG in general made an effort to help Viper outside of the game. FPX was 100% focused on the game and didnt know (or try hard) to help Nuguri with him being homesick and feeling isolated.

hmacn3e,Exclarius,11/27/2021,1,311.0,> If one of my parents were on their deathbed I would spend as much time with them as possible. Not playing ARAM lol.  This is now the third comment focusing on this minute detail of a random example that I was giving so Ill just once again copy paste my other reply:  > People deal with grief in different ways. Some people want distraction some people want to just spend time on their own some people start hyperfocusing on their passion. If Arams are a distraction and thereby a coping mechanism then who are you to question this?  _____ > If I wanted to play ARAM to take my mind off things I would start a new account and not use my main as that would bring unwanted attention to both myself and my team.  Youre telling me that when youre dealing with great stress/trauma youre 100% clearminded and will always make the most optimal logical decisions in every situation?
hmaxba6,HarmlessSnack,11/27/2021,1,84.0,Garen Top super simple game plan.  Annie Mid or Veigar mid both fairly simple and safe from ganks.  Caitlyn Bot look up the Lethality Build very ez to play.  If you get support Leona is pretty easy to play.  If you get Jungle you might wanna just dodge until you really learn game macro and have a chance to practice jungle clears.

hmbzopx,RemoteAnalysis3809,11/27/2021,1,263.0,OK lets put aside the fact that Chinese people arent the only people celebrating the Lunar new year so its not at all Chinese holiday vs the rest of the worlds holidays (not that the rest of the world shares the same holidays anyway).   Why would Chinese players dislike winter map anyway? Its not like they dont have winter and snow over there? I feel like your assumption here is that only China dont want winter maps and I just find that quite the baseless statement.
hmchlgr,Naerlyn,11/27/2021,1,23.0,On the bug squads discord we create a channel for a champion whenever it appears that it has some serious enough issues / numerous enough issues.   So we have bug channels for 78 different champions. And another 39 channels for bug topics that arent champions (match history runes monsters tft turrets pathing client etc).   This game does have a lot of bugs. And Im also glad for this awareness trend.
hma4xhq,CreepyMosquitoEater,11/27/2021,1,72.0,Its so indescribably broken on melee champions that use attack speed. Yasuo Master Yi Tryndamere and even Udyr top i saw abusing it. How did they ever think that 90% attack speed at level 1 would be anywhere close to balanced?

hmbgtss,Outfox3D,11/27/2021,1,303.0,Yeah even on its best case users its not gonna be the best choice for laning. Right now you can kinda cruise and just not fight because objective bounties will punish your opponent for overperforming in lane but I doubt thatll be the case for terribly long. Its a nothing rune in lane - especially compared to its old version.  Also yeah sad to see Aphelios Q doesnt stack it. I was reading on the aphelios sub that it doesnt stack at all from the extra autos from any of his abilities ... which is a bit of a ripoff since hed probably benefit from it better than most marksmen.

hmax1zu,Random_Stealth_Ward,11/27/2021,1,86.0,> Since midgame to lategame its still applied very fast. Unless the ADC is a Runaan user it will indeed be mono target.   Fair enough although tbh i expected runnan to not apply it since abilities like Ezreal Q or GP Q dont count towards the 3 autos necessary.  > And idk about the 50% threshold. Tanks may not be able to put them below it themselves but in a teamfight setting would it matter ? Their backline is supposedly dealing the needed damages.   Yeah but if the enemy isnt attacking the tank/bruiser then the GW wouldnt be applying unless we make it apply to slows and inmobilizations. For example lets say a Darius or Vladimir is attacking your team with current Thorn you can apply it to them by ccing them but with this change you wouldnt be able to apply the 60% gw yourself.  Perhaps you could make a combo of the 50% threshold and keep the inmobilization passive on a cooldown but that still is a nerf to tank users overall.
hmb44wy,ianwk40,11/27/2021,1,13.0,Very nice
hm9md57,zUkUu,11/27/2021,1,51.0,If you dont need anti-heal AT ALL or are behind I go Steraks second.  Im jungle main so Steraks isnt as needed as early. The powerspike from getting a full second item before everyone else is huge tho.
hm9m5nv,lnickelly,11/27/2021,1,130.0,Idk dude I see someone lip syncing like this and I click off it’s reactionary for me I just think it looks stupid and don’t understand why people do it lol

hmb242x,Arkaidan8,11/27/2021,1,,Dude you cant abuse that bug you can literally get permabanned for it and again ITS A BUG.  That said it doesnt matter whether you have Galeforce or Kraken once an AD carry has IE LDR and once a mage has Voidstaff there is no such thing as lasting more than 5 seconds. I dont know if you are still playing in preseason 11 but juggernauts cant ignore anyone their itemazation got demolished and until they change the armor/mres fromula or add more % damage reduction/health items its gonna stay that way.

hmbvv04,grandorder123,11/27/2021,1,221.0,I disagree for example lulu has more skins than jinx but they are pretty average overall. Jinx has higher quality skins that definitely have sold more.
hmc3gy0,rmbar19,11/27/2021,1,261.0,When did I say I was entitled to it? You threw that in there yourself dont add to things people are saying and attack it.  The reply I posted to said nothing of not wanting to it straight said they put their dev time into drakes-which on its own would imply took the place of the map.  Further while making winter themed maps in and of itself may not bring in money it can bring in/retain people. Think of the holidays and what you say in virtually every store you walk into. Youll see halloween decorations in October Christmas in December etc. People enjoy it and tend to get drawn to it. Its like when youre offered a free burger on your first visit. They company makes no money (they lose it in that case) doing it but do it to bring in more customers.  This isnt just physical stores though. Online stores video games even various other websites do too as part of the season.  At the end of the day its something pretty normal that if done right will bring in extra money. Not doing it just looks lazy. I cant speak for everyone but their lack of care for these types of details is whats caused me to not buy ANY RP as of late. Its not the same company I used to support so I dont fork over my money. Yeah Im only one example but Im sure if we polled thered be plenty others out there who would say the same.  So if money and having a dedicated playerbase doesnt matter to them then I would agree-it doesnt matter. But if they care about these things then they should start giving a damn.
hmbnguv,Cassian_J,11/27/2021,1,2.0,I agree they look similar but I really hope they never do anything live action

hm9og9m,MikiHere,11/27/2021,1,38.0,The writing for that event was so god awful and painful to read. I really enjoyed Lucian and Senna lorewise but after that event they went from one of my favorite champs to a source of annoyance.

hm9v5p9,kaynpayn,11/27/2021,1,288.0,Yeah but on the other hand you probably couldnt have created the same level of production due to tech restrictions. 8 years of computer development is massive.
hmalau2,SP3EDI,11/27/2021,1,392.0,Fnatic management cant say more about it because its against the Laws. They told them that its a legit reason but they where trowing a childish tantrum because they demand to know the specifics. Fnatic could do exactly nothing about it if Adam/bwipo/nisqy didnt want to accept the decision of the rest of the team/org. Those 3 are now let go of and all gucci. There is no reason to even talk about his but Adam is still trowing a tantrum .
hma1ts1,Rektile7,11/27/2021,1,25.0,And Bwipo and Adam said they were completely in the dark and blindsided with Nisqy supporting them on this situation
hmb7su5,CreativeAd481,11/27/2021,1,,This is a weird comparison  > Like with infernal you can say carries gain a lot but tanks gain very little fair but in this case tanks gain nothing except getting shredded a whole lot faster.  Youre comparing a Tank that gets Infernal versus a tank that has to fight against Chemtech?

hmbh8gk,dom_gar,11/27/2021,1,154.0,I have one game where we almost lost it but we got soul and killed nexus with Sion GA Chemtech drake and his passive.
hmb81xv,pimpsquirrel,11/27/2021,1,209.0,Okay so 2 things are going through my head here:  1. Your friend learned to play the game through ranked and has now played so much ranked that the LP system fucked him up (you get much more lp for a win when u start playing ranked vs later). This LP issue gets people hardstuck especially so since it affects their mental state. In this case just make a new account for ranked (you can buy a level 30 account for cheap if ur too lazy to level it up) and rank up from there  2. Passively sabotaging himself - for the first year if playing I almost did not improve at all. You need to actively try and improve to improve which most people unknowingly dont do. Honestly best way to get out of that is waching videos like Skill Capped that help you develop critical thinking in-game and after that watching streams and plays made by good players on your main champions. When I started watching Taco I pasisvely ended up improving at Jhin with rvery video because it heloed me realise all my champ can do and what his limits are/how to play into what matchup. This promoted me to think more in game myself and try what I saw.  Hope this is helpful :)
hmawkdg,Nearby-Check-6841,11/27/2021,1,8496.0,Just started rewatching it what a shame
hm9lw0r,1UnoriginalName,11/27/2021,1,174.0,K*yn Flair 🤢
hm9obco,shineyumbreon,11/27/2021,1,200.0,Unless its a minor disability op doesnt know about. I dont really know the proper term for it but I do have some close friends who are not as smart as the rest but dont tell that to every friend they have.
hmbjpum,Naymliss,11/27/2021,1,33.0,She had a 50% winrate mid a 47% winrate support both with very low playrates.  Reddits recency bias strikes again I see.
hmaby31,ikingjosh,11/27/2021,1,12395.0,Id agree.  I was so invested after Act 1 but became pretty disengaged by the end of Act 3
hma4gfj,SovereignType,11/27/2021,1,9.0,Only way I can describe it... this obsession on teeny angst aggression gameplay being the only viable strategy is boring and is only going to appeal to children and people who havent grown up yet.
hmae2gh,kinkywolf1993,11/27/2021,1,407.0,Missing tattoos and too much boobs pretty cool I would let her destroy piltover
hmbtrr4,MarioToast,11/27/2021,1,45.0,The last shot we see of him in Arcane (which also shows Vander midway into becoming Warwick) has Singed looking at a picture of a girl who looks like a human Orianna.

hmb1zti,scribi0,11/27/2021,1,3.0,Damn he angy
hmaph6m,InspiringMilk,11/27/2021,1,40.0,Really? I thought it was because it discouraged killing him and he was a bruiser so it didnt fit him.
hmaf8ij,LunaLance_,11/27/2021,1,441.0,Ah its an easy mistake to make. Your brain wants to look at the task at hand. In this case she is focused on filming. If she were actually aiming down a working scope surely she would close the proper eye 😁  I had to train myself to stop doing this with my Fallout cosplay props. I havent shot an actual weapon in over 2 years.
hmav2gl,daneel1,11/27/2021,1,170.0,I agree that ranged have an advantage overall. My problem is with lethal tempo which is not that great for ranged anymore. Again in this instakill meta you cant auto attack 6 times to benefit of it.
hma1e12,Suicide_King8,11/27/2021,1,30.0,wait youve seen her?
hmaj35o,Rawdream,11/27/2021,1,26.0,When it comes to motivate them all the EDG staff and coaches are the best on that  [Heres another example from Aaron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgGt4eNrPhw) Managing Director who couldnt travel with them he really cares about them.  EDGs YouTube Channel they have more content like that and more things:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk3CnidZdYE_b67RL2Uq1cA/videos
hmapw2l,ynkesfan2003,11/27/2021,1,12.0,The player who picked didnt own the champion so they picked Annie as a placeholder
hmbhe1j,Civil718,11/27/2021,1,561.0,She might just look like that and possible overbite

hmc7671,bubbleandsqueee,11/27/2021,1,345.0,I would say he is going to make another show in arcane seeing as he basically saved Jayce at the beginning - We all know those runes were his.   I mean the realm warp was way bigger than you see on SR but he was prob smurfing

hmaj1oi,Pure_Void,11/27/2021,1,26.0,blind pick is 10x more toxic then draft since at the start its a race for roles and when ppl dont get it they complain or cheat u out of there role so the first thing i would do is play draft only and if ur just starting the game i wouldnt play ranked when u hit 30 because u dont know enough about the game id just keep playing draft till u learn alot more
hmcuh15,PunishmentPingu,11/27/2021,1,,I think people really underrate Jensen/DL just because they dont make it out of groups at worlds they arent suddenly terrible players (top ~20 in the world? Pretty good?). People think Sven is trash too because C9 dropped him for flash-for-crabs.   I dont think TLs top side is anywhere near as good as people think. Bjerg hasnt been great for what.. over 2 years? His LCS form has not been great let alone his last worlds. Bwipo is also coming off a season in the jungle and typically overextends so if other teams recognise that there could be some weak points (even if I do think TL win the spring split just down to the bot lane being by FAR the best)
hm9cdzz,Liyandri,11/27/2021,1,27.0,Right because League totally doesnt have a yearly revenue of \~2 billion USD and Riot totally doesnt have the resources to pay someone $20 to replace the Baron 3D file for Santa Baron. /s
hmbk1al,wootduhfarg,11/27/2021,1,174.0,I mean we also got similiar stuff in the West.  T1 fans against LS and his granny or   French fans against Upset.
hma8zpu,snupppi,11/27/2021,1,192.0,Lets see how good Larssen is then HAHA
hmadi5o,Iso_Sek,11/27/2021,1,2.0,Disgusting
hmc1p9h,Kepazhe,11/27/2021,1,262.0,eh dota 2 custom maps kinda did. people installed a map that had pumpkins instead of trees that showed juke paths better
hm9g3fx,iMidg3t,11/27/2021,1,372.0,Which is why people went to EUW to ESCAPE THE SERVER.   So why do you think merging them would be a good idea?  there is a reason why good players go to EUW. It should stay that way.
hmcgt5x,ImoutoCompAlex,11/27/2021,1,618.0,Bloodier “91.” Ah yes League players born in the first half of the 90s. My people. Yeah I remember the announcement too. People were already trying to theory craft if they were actual sisters or not even back then.
hm96x9k,Robinem14,11/27/2021,1,29.0,That’s true. The nexus still blows up when you FF though lol.
hma2siq,PacificCod,11/27/2021,1,29.0,He got paid 2.8 million. Its his job as a professional to do his best and not have a negative mindset. You dont see Faker go ah my teammates suck Ill just try to focus on myself and solo carry then and refuse to talk to my teammates.  If you get paid 2.8 million its your job to play league and not play PUBG to the point where FPX has to cut off your internet.  If you get paid 2.8 million its your job to learn skills (like a new language) that helps you communicate with your teammates in-game and outside of the game.  Rookie Doinb Scout Viper all dont have the same problem with communication. Vipers Chinese is really good if you listen to EDGs MicChecks. They all understand their job as a professional goes beyond just playing the game by yourself. They all understand that being able to communicate makes a real difference in the success of a team-based game. Whether its being able to communicate in-game issues or draft issues or style of gameplay issues.  This is on Nuguri for not having a professional mindset.
hma1wnn,ApplePitou,11/27/2021,1,1.0,Real life Powder cosplay and thanks you for sharing this masterpiece :3  Additionally you looks beautiful and very accurate :3
hm9h8lj,Prestonwww,11/27/2021,1,32.0,I had a really bad experience with medications and now I refuse to take any for mental health. As for therapy I 100% relate to you. Ive tried therapy over and over and over again. Maybe Im just not finding the right therapist or its not the right time in my life for me to I guess be ready for therapy. Im not sure.
hm9hnlm,ye1l,11/27/2021,1,51.0,I still think that theyre gonna gun for SA. Only reason he went to TSM instead of TES last season was money. Karsa and the rest of the team wanted him for this season.
hm965me,GalaxySmash,11/27/2021,1,42.0,As a heads up these very detailed lists that outline as much detail as possible and most importantly the REPRODUCTION STEPS are the best possible chance you have for your bug to get tracked and fixed. We try our best to keep up but we need to rely on player reports and these kinds of posts make that so so much easier.

hmabq41,DrLuciferZ,11/27/2021,1,130.0,New stuff is exclusive to Paramount+. In fact they just got some heat for suddenly pulling global distribution rights from Netflix to Paramount+ just days before season 4 was supposed to come out.
hm9g48z,AureaMediocritas1,11/27/2021,1,47.0,technically he isnt a warden anymore since his w is his ult now and he has only situational ways to cc

hm9lki6,TH3RM4L33,11/27/2021,1,230.0,Thats a common floating bug on all champions. From my experience it only happens locally so others dont actually see you floating. If it happens restarting your game should fix it.
hmartbu,catseye013,11/27/2021,1,129.0,I mean there are people doing it for free lol. Riot could legit just pay them like 50 dollars then put it in the game.
hmam7vp,goblin0100,11/27/2021,1,12.0,You are quite possibly the most stupid person I have talked to on this subreddit all year congratulations
hmc7giw,RageFiasco,11/27/2021,1,68.0,How are people taking the Orianna spin? In her present lore she gave her heart to her father to save his life and as a result became 100% machine. Where Arcane is at hextech has not developed anywhere near enough to accomplish this feat.
hmbc8p5,homer12346,11/27/2021,1,9.0,while noxus are conquerors they are also inclusive as long as you can back yourself up with some way to serve the empire either fighting on the frontlines or working on weapon/armor production or important intel etc  they are grey
hmcy4mz,Migster257,11/27/2021,1,87.0,Jensen/DL by themselves definitely cost around the same if not more than one year of Swordart. Those three together most definitely cost more     Also having Lost and PoE will hold a team back imho.
hma9l93,Passi1612,11/27/2021,1,311.0,Isnt that exactly what upset did? Family emergancy is vague enough what more do you need to know?
hmasxbt,ghoulboy56,11/27/2021,1,84.0,For the new players you should have explained her passive and whats the bug. Like me. Ive been playing this game for 3 years.
hmauoy1,Angry---train,11/27/2021,1,170.0,Yes the old lethal tempo was just going to magically make you survive an assasins burst

hmc0g4k,CosmoJones07,11/27/2021,1,,Wow awesome.  Thanks.
hm9gr1w,GunnerPup13,11/27/2021,1,32.0,Honestly I really like LoL. I’ve been thinking of getting back into it but I’m not sure on it. I’ve got a few friends that still okay but at this point. It’s almost like the experience jaded me towards the game.   I look at it like the new Call of Duty games. Some have been alright some are just garbage. This most recent one is just garbage to me. The characters are boring and they admit they wanted to make this game like a movie and I’m sorry but Call of Duty isn’t a movie. It’s just gross. They did a World War 2 style game beautifully with World at War. It was period correct and just stunning. Now it feels like a cheap cash grab and I can’t stand playing the game. The experience has just gone downhill for me and I don’t want to play it.
hma7706,Newfypuppie,11/27/2021,1,12.0,I think it’s the opposite have you tried to deal damage without an LDR in the current meta? It’s miserable
hmae4s5,Tilterino247,11/27/2021,1,212.0,Youre not the guy I replied to so Ill let you in on the joke you missed. He said liftlift doesnt guarantee you worlds and then went on to tell us how bad he did at worlds as his explanation. Notice he deleted his comment because he realized it was dumb.
hmcoxns,dimitri0610,11/27/2021,1,13.0,How many games have you played with those gains/losses? I had to play about 400 ish this season until things started evening out for me. I dont believe it has much to do with preseason.
hma9di5,HandsomeTaco,11/27/2021,1,57.0,The VN is not a canon depiction of what happened. But Rookie and all the major story elements are canon. For now at least.

hmaki1u,falkner97,11/27/2021,1,376.0,>Wheres the basic respect for Upset by the way?  his basic respect is him leaving the team and giving basic respect to his teammate by letting them know of the situation   thats the exchange that should have happen and not him leaving without letting people know   like im not even saying he should say 100% of what happen   just go to his teammate tell them something very important happen or something very bad happen but i cant tell you all etc etc   let them know its something very bad and not   oh sorry urgent family matters   like hello?   &#x200B  >one year of working together doesnt mean youre entitled to know what happened to someone from my family  if its in a normal setting like a workplace or whatever sure   but in a worlds competition with your team who worked with you for a whole year?   thats a completely different thing   every decision of yours affect them and their future and their career  its just pure irresponsible to say it doesnt matter to his teammates   they dont need to know or they dont deserve to know

hmae3xe,xGlaedr,11/27/2021,1,310.0,His familys privacy DOES affect him having to tell his coworkers. He doesnt owe them shit beyond family emergency. No one year of working together doesnt mean youre entitled to know what happened to someone from my family. Holy shit people here are deluded and detached from reality.  Wheres the basic respect for Upset by the way?
hmc7qx5,homer12346,11/27/2021,1,10.0,where is darius op? he has horrible winrates pretty much everywhere except for master
hmakcez,homer12346,11/27/2021,1,8.0,you can make the exact same argument about gragas Q
hmallq6,CreativeAd481,11/27/2021,1,40.0,If you look at the Winrate stats it turns out that every soul is actually approximately the same power level with the exception of the Chemtech Soul which is significantly more powerful. So dont feel too bad about getting Cloud or Ocean since it doesnt actually affect your chances of winning the game by that much.

hmb44pc,Cpt_Cosmo,11/27/2021,1,530.0,Mate they started 2 years after this and likely had the idea from the moment they made these teasers. Good products dont just pop into existence out of nowhere.
hmbaxb5,100WattCrusader,11/27/2021,1,125.0,??? I don’t understand the point of your response tbh. Nowhere did I hard criticize riot rather I’m just addressing the point of the post and of the response here.   Riot has time to adjust it. Whether or not they do is up in the air but there’s people justifying it’s strength as if it should stay that way and I’m trying to say it really shouldn’t.
hmbgs7w,L4SiegeAintThatBad,11/27/2021,1,153.0,Wait is there not a cooldown? I had a game where we had soul and I 1v1d this Camille got her to 1hp and I didn’t get revived. Did I just get fucked by a bug?
hmaktl2,homer12346,11/27/2021,1,3.0,if you are willing to spend money buying the event pass and then spending all the event tokens on champion shards (you get like 50% more BE from shards than buying raw BE) and you will unlock like 10-15 champs each event depending on how much you play

hmau641,WoorieKod,11/27/2021,1,112.0,Building wrong items on a champion in a single match doesnt devalue his achievements and efforts just treat it as a mistake and let go - why keep harping on his build?
hm9lgrs,maidboy,11/27/2021,1,167.0,someone has to say it otherwise redditors like you will circlejerk to his achievement
hmat9wf,BBQMasterDad,11/27/2021,1,23.0,I honestly don’t have nearly as much of an issue with Lux as I do Zyra. That champ is straight up unfun to lane again unless you’re Morgana/Lux.
hm9p3pg,vpvp1,11/27/2021,1,13.0,agree. My friends hardstucked silver 1/gold 5 for 4 years when I played with him he played legitimately like a gold5 game knowledge and mechanics of a gold5. But somehow he got d4 in season 9 or 10 as support main.  And from what Ive seen on streams lots of master elo supports play like d4 so I come to conclusion the role has been inflated and tyler1 shares the same opinion. Even Dopa said something similar about support role this year he said something like  lower 1 division of a support player and youll get their true rank

This makes me jealous.
hmbqlpt,zultari,11/27/2021,1,4.0,I like seeing these for awareness on bugs and to see who can one-up the previous bug list of a champ. No one comes close to old Mordekaiser though but this is neat.

hm9uyr8,TheUnk0wnDead,11/27/2021,1,4.0,False information. All prestige skins from 2020 and 2021 whether from the prestige shop initially or from events will be available at the prestige point shop for 2020 prestige points at the end of the year including the upcoming Brand prestige skin from the next event.  The catch is that they wont have a border like you normally get when you earn them.

He still has a long way to go and here you are shitting on him like theyre equals.
hm95bdg,Oreo-and-Fly,11/27/2021,1,18.0,I mean they wouldnt make sense to get Sentinels either.  The reason the rest got sentinel skins was because they went to the sentinel base.  No reason to recruit yorick/kalista who already were at the isles then go back to the base then head there again.
hmaehzt,Exclarius,11/27/2021,1,,> All this just points to an inability on Upsets part to view himself as anything other than a victim.  Imagine the victim of harassment feeling as a victim of harassment. What an idea.  > Mate if he is still all this time later so utterly distraught that he cant even think straight enough to send a DM to his fucking teammate....  He told his direct management what was going on. His management knows about it and informs his teammates. There is not a single issue here. It is up to Upset to decide who he wants to go in to details about his situation to. Seeing how Adam handled this Im not surprised that Upset didnt tell him every explicit detail.  It is really not a weird concept to not want to broadcast private issues to the world. If I am going through something Ill explain it to my teamlead but I am under no obligation to explain my life story to my direct colleagues. Of course if I want to I can do this but it is not a must.

hmabpud,howtopayherefor,11/27/2021,1,49.0,Players in the beginning are really awful. I started playing LoL like almost a decade ago and I remember it being quite common for teammates to complain about kill stealing or to completely give up because one person was playing badly so I guess that hasnt changed. Right now I still sometimes see dickheads but things do get better. It really helps if you can have friends to play with

hmcjo9n,Midna_of_Twili,11/27/2021,1,440.0,I feel like it really doesn’t. It was a joke. Jax wasn’t a serious character. It’s like saying Deadpool diminishes the movie Logan just by existing.

Check Check and triple check.  Screwy politics where everything is demonized no matter which side your on? Well sorta kinda not really? Idk this one doesnt seem to fit quite as much  And lastly: firm belief that theyre better than everyone else. Oh hell yes.  Yup this checks out
hm93smh,KnockoutRoundabout,11/27/2021,1,7741.0,People in this thread deadass have never been responsible for young kids lmao.  Powder did REALLY stupid shit that had dire consequences but all of it makes sense as long as you keep in mind that she is a young traumatized child whos desperation to be seen as useful and able to contribute skewed whatever child rationality she had.  Also she basically had little bombs. You give ANY kid bombs and things are likely to go bad if they are smart enough to know how to activate them.  Of COURSE her decisions and behavior are gonna be weird as hell when you look at it from the perspective of an adult. But imo Powders behavior from start to finish was all completely in-line with how they had built up her character as well as how most traumatized kids would act (though uh with less fantastical scenarios).  You dont have to like her obviously but saying she was out of character or what happened makes no sense is just nonsense.
hmai2ra,fedaralala,11/27/2021,1,6.0,I gained +14 losing 14-16 all season while being in Platinum with a 53/54% winrate. The moment I hit Diamond I gained +18-20 losing less than I gain. It doesnt really make sense to me.

hmb3mrt,MoonDawg2,11/27/2021,1,206.0,> Dude you cant abuse that bug you can literally get permabanned for it and again ITS A BUG.  Dude animation cancels are bugs and so are a ton of other mechanics. Cait alone had several bug abuses through the years and no one was ever banned for it. Abuse the bug youre not going to be banned and nobody cares if you do.   Weve had config abuses for years too. Bigger minimap before that was a thing bigger resolution screens further away specific cancelations of champs (kaisa Q evolve is the best example) and other shit that you can do with the .json file.  If its not fixed then its abusable since this game is so riddled with bugs that half the time youre doing one without even realizing it.  > That said it doesnt matter whether you have Galeforce or Kraken once an AD carry has IE LDR and once a mage has Voidstaff there is no such thing as lasting more than 5 seconds.  So when juggernauts are supposed to fall off? Even then I dont think Ive seen juggernauts not at least tank they usually last a good amount of time.  Are you sure youre farming correctly? The only time Ive seen this is when the juggernaut player is behind which is completely acceptable at that point. That or vayne/kog are in the game.
hmbpp9h,PixiCode,11/27/2021,1,3.0,Yes but that doesnt really answer the question that this is ultimately asking where did the idea/inspiration come from to make Jhin specifically obsess with the number 4?  Probably not this but thats ultimately what its asking.

hmaz8vh,Suspicious-Bus6351,11/27/2021,1,,Nuguri is not the same person as GimGoon or Khan. Nuguri is much more introverted as you already noted than both of these guys you have approach the situation based off the individual. I dont think FPX is totally to blame here obviously some of this is Nuguris fault too but I dont understand why FPX management didnt make a bigger effort to integrate Nuguri considering the fact that they were paying him so much money.

hm9l54d,wes_T_ward,11/27/2021,1,7.0,There are some game strategies where like you wont get kills or assists that are legitimate ie proxy singed. Like KDA doesnt wholly reflect wether your trolling like if you drag their whole team to chase you and waste their time then that gives your own team a better gold and exp lead and turns fights from 5x5 to like 4 v 3 or 4 v 2.

hma3z1f,AalfredWilibrordius,11/27/2021,1,7.0,You generally just play to win lane until 14min unless you secure a really good timing  For example you shove the wave recall then youd walk back to lane because you have time because you shoved but instead you see bot lane having a clown fiesta so you tp bot kill then recall again and walk top  In games where you have premade teammates you can also do the same but then walk to dragon to secure it and then tp top. Of course this only works if your four other teammates are willing to follow up  The general trend is that you need to mind the position of the waves and make a value judgment of what youre losing vs what you can win ahead of time
hmbenjj,Overkiller00,11/27/2021,1,154.0,its not that broken and Riot even said the new drakes are ment to be stronger then the old ones.
hmawshf,e_zzzz,11/27/2021,1,19.0,It’s not exactly that games are going late(plus these guys are just memeing and having shit tons of fun) games are even more snowbally hence why 1st herald and having strong early+scaling topside is so important. Plus people and pros want to try for the new maps and soul so dragons are prioritized for soul point. I’m currently playing in some semi serious inhouses of master-chally players and games are ending 30-35 min tops but you see top mid and ad have tons of income by then
hmajitg,mokura,11/27/2021,1,23.0,most broken soul in the game more worth than elder or baron.
hmc5bm4,mbr4life1,11/27/2021,1,3.0,Most champs in support (other than like Sona type scaling enchanters) are very effective with little gold. Even the mages in support like brand or zyra can do lots of damage / provide utility without needing more than a mythic. Leona and Alister engage and tank without needing gold etc.

hmb6oxc,TeeTheSame,11/27/2021,1,163.0,People have to accept that in a professional team not everyone has to be friends with each other. If Nuguri is not participating socially but doing his job well then you shouldnt make a problem out of that. Coaching staff has to solve actual conflicts and work on team performance gameplay. I think Nuguris gameplay was fine from what I saw most of the time. He doesnt need to talk at all if he gets the job done.
hmaauqz,falkner97,11/27/2021,1,313.0,if you want to speak years and what not than lets speak it   so he can talk to yamato?   he can talk to his management?   but he cant fking talk to his other teammates?   he must have know all his management and yamato since he was born than?   what next? gonna talk about how an org works?   than his teammates is literally nothing to him than?
hm9f5if,Doverkeen,11/27/2021,1,163.0,Whats your current rank? Do you have any clue about the game?
hmbz762,happygreenturtle,11/27/2021,1,385.0,if you rely on coinflipping better teammates that is the definition of being at your deserved rank.   Tyler1 is not a good example of a high elo player being stuck in low elo because he chain queues 20 games every single day even when hes tilted as fuck and he was also playing roles hed never played before. When Tyler was in Gold in his top lane challenge he wasnt playing like a Masters level player. Thats why its stupid to compare him to a Masters level player being stuck in Gold. He wasnt.

hm9menw,GunnerPup13,11/27/2021,1,,I’m glad to know that I’m not the only one who feels like the more recent Pokémon games have been kind of going downhill. I feel like I’m running out of ideas. To the point that they’re just releasing older games. That’s not always bad but there comes a point where it’s no longer nostalgic. If that makes sense. I really do like my older Pokémon games I still have my copy of leaf green. But I’m not spending as much money in a newer Pokémon game unless they add something really cool. And I’m sorry Dyna Max evolutions are not doing it for me. They’re cool but I wouldn’t have made most of the game around it. I will say with sword and shield I loved the map. I really liked the region and I thought it was really cool. But I feel like a lot of these re-releases of older games and starting to get to be a little too repetitive. Because didn’t we have another version of gold and silver not even 10 years ago? And didn’t they do a release of diamond and pearl twice? At that point that’s a little excessive. If you’re going to release a game release at once. After that that needs to be a little bit more than just 10 years in between the games. It’s like Disney movies nowadays. They keep releasing older movies as live action. I don’t necessarily mind it but some of them are really boring. I could not stand the remake of Mulan and I don’t know very many people who liked it. And I don’t blame people for not liking it. I watched it once and I do not wanna watch it again.

hm9jyns,Piegan,11/27/2021,1,21.0,I miss when we didnt have any of this automated timing garbage and early warning for camp spawns. If you wanted to time buffs or dragons you had to do it yourself and when I had to type 823ob 921er in chat it felt like my team paid a lot more attention to it VS auto timers that show up when you press tab. Being rewarded for keeping track of the 6 minute dragon timer and being there early while the other team forgot and showed up too late to contest it felt so good.  But they added timers for buffs dragon baron herald. You get enough warning on something spawning that you can run cross-map for it in most cases. Its a very slippery slope give it 5 more years and well have automated timers for practically everything.

hmaq9kr,lumni,11/27/2021,1,11.0,Its a very solid (second) item on KhaZix depending on the game.   If the team is relying on you to be the flanking assassin and the other team is gunning for you as you are ahead then you can do this:  Go duskblade CDR boots and then pick up axiom arc.  You can go evolve R as the second evolve and with the CDR + this item youre basically just invisible all the time. It gives you unparalleled flanking power and mobility to go in and out of fights.   You will have up your R twice in teamfights unless its a wombo-combo fest but then you shouldnt be going this item and will be playing KhaZix in a different way anyways.  Its not broken or anything but depending on the game it can be very good. Also KhaZix is more of a solid jungler than Nocturne is. So that helps as well -)

Mid should always be ready to play with jungle and help sidelanes while pulling the enemy jungle and support into your lane.

hm903kx,TheLifePocketKnife,11/27/2021,1,199.0,I had contacted Riot so many times over the years since he has been reworked and always got back 3 lines as a response even with a similar amount of documentation. 4000+ words and numerous tickets always yielded a well look into it. Good on you you were able to get the ball rolling. Myself and many others I know actually stopped playing Talon because of the bugs. One thing that is worthy noting that is more vanity but with his Blackwood skin his jaw is crooked thats what showed me the effort Riot put into this champ. Funnily enough I was saving up a fair bit of clips when I did play League for a similar video as this but props to you for getting it done. Cheers nonetheless.  Edit: One more thing is how infuriated I always was I was always told to sit down and stop complaining and that the champion is not buggy that I was just bad. I remember showing a detailed replay with the leblanc snare and Talon q and being told that is normal. So to see such a well made video detailing everything makes me feel heard more than Riot ever did.
hm9sz0r,TH3RM4L33,11/27/2021,1,237.0,Its smoother for the combo if you dont have to basic attack manually since the point of Q is to make you basic attack unless you cancel it on purpose (and R is not an ability that cancels basic attacks).  For example using R during ranged Q doesnt cancel the basic attack so the combo is smooth (meanwhile melee Q is the opposite for no reason). R not cancelling the attack is a good reliable behavior that everyone who plays Talon is aware of and agrees with it. Having to do it manually in a lot of action (hitboxes overlapping enemies dashing camera moving etc) is clunky and unreliable.

hmbdiuk,NymphomaniacWalrus,11/27/2021,1,94.0,Just because its a shit item doesnt mean its not a bruiser item.  Its an item designed to be used by bruisers against magic damage heavy comps so they can survive the burst. Steraks Gage outshines it in every capacity but theyre still both bruiser items.  Same reason youd call Vigilant Wardstone a support item even though no one builds it either.

hmboyna,Akait0,11/27/2021,1,417.0,I said that Adam got screwed over and nowhere did I say that he couldnt be as angry as he wants to.  Totally understandable to be mad. Now going to social media to vent and also speculate about Upsets reasons? Absolute inmature behavour.   Wanting to know why is perfectly reasonable. Being owed an explanation? Beyond family issues not really no. No one is owed an elaborate explanation beyond that. Not even FNC but if Upset didnt explain to management/coaching staff why hed most likely get fired so he did give one to them.   But reddit loves drama and wants to know -for different reasons- why Upset left so here we are siding with Adam.

hma6w4v,kupukapow,11/27/2021,1,7.0,Thats not the proper way to snowball a lead through top lane. Sure it can work to roam around and help your team but ad a general rule of thumb top laners win the game by dominating lane and then just steamrolling their advantage. In top lane your goal is to get an advantage and then make it impossible for the enemy laner to face you until you can eventually 1v2. Then you want to draw the enemy jungler to your lane and kill them. From there you can win.  Obviously thats the ideal scenario but going into every game as a top laner youre going to want to press your advantage through sidelanes.
hmacbj6,DifferentHorse,11/27/2021,1,13.0,I can handle toxic up to a point until they start telling people to (hope you) die of covid. Because thats just something really fucked up to say.
hm9864d,WeirdChamp960,11/27/2021,1,27.0,The bounties usually kick in at maybe 3k gold lead (my experience). If you arent able to pick up any of Tower/Drake/herald because of a gold diff thats only 3k then its not a design flaw. Yes the enemy ist stronger and it can be hard to get them but in almost all games you will be able to get outer turrets or go for herald while they do drake. They are collected atleast once in most of the Games I have seen this far. When behind or ahead in both cases Objective bounties have been taken in most games. A 3k lead doesnt mean you are so far behind that taking anything off your opponent is unlikely

hm9wi2x,TheSoupKitchen,11/27/2021,1,69.0,Everyone chiming in that Tencent doesnt make decisions or tell them what to do is missing the point of the post. Its more about Riots priorities and where it lies with fans. Something like this snow map is arguably simple to make but goes a long way. Though jts obviously not going to generate profits which may be a reason why resources arent put toward something like this. Similar to why they dont invest a ton in making new game modes and maps. Simply because its enjoyed by a minority and maybe their limited resources are better elsewhere for whatever reason.   That being said I miss the snow map even if it would be bad for clarity in some (many) instances.

hmaozn8,IntelligentForce245,11/27/2021,1,98.0,Lol youre telling a world champion who hard carried in LPL and put up some insane stats including his Irelia eventually being permabanned that he needs to copy builds from a guy who doesnt even have a team and take criticism from a silver analyst.

hmal16c,FantasyTrash,11/27/2021,1,376.0,League is a job first. He is well within his rights to choose what personal information he shares with his colleagues. Only Yamato and Dardo truly need to know. Hyli for example didn’t even ask he just trusted Upset. That is an exemplary colleague and teammate.  Upset said he couldn’t trust Adam and look what happened Adam aired out so much dirty laundry and practically invited people to harass Upset and his wife. It’s this kind of situation Upset wanted to avoid yet it happened anyway and validated that Adam couldn’t be trusted.

hma902z,R-R-Clon,11/27/2021,1,6.0,The more you lose the more you play and the losing streak become worse with every lose the best advice is to stop playing league for a week at least three to four days you will come back refresh and high in spirit.

hmcgits,MoonDawg2,11/27/2021,1,422.0,> Then go ahead if it feels right to you and you are so sure that you wont be getting banned why dont you get a free ticket to challenger with an istant undodgable Blitz hook? So surprised nobody is abusing it when its 100% safe to do!  If this bug does exist then blitz should be straight up disabled and hotfixed. If somebody is abusing it while I would hate them I cant blame them. Riot doesnt do shit and hasnt been clear about bug abusing at all.  I dont mind people bug abusing all players bug abuse in league. The issue is the extent of bug abusing and when riot isnt clear on those lines I cant be against somebody abusing sett E bug for example or the multiple bugs that cait used to have. Its up to riot to draw the line not the players.  > It was a 3 items Ezreal with Serylda Sunderer Muramana and a 4 items Kinkdred with Bork LDr Rapid fire and Kraken and i died in less than 3 seconds. I had Omens Gauntlet Tabi Bramble Titanic Anathema (on Akali).  If you got 1 shot on akali you got caught. So you eat all of their instant burst to the face on an off-tank build on a squishy character like akali. Honestly though you would have survived that shit if you had steraks and likely killed one of them funny enough.  Thats fine then honestly.

hm9q6m3,CCrimson93X,11/27/2021,1,8.0,And then maybe Riot will do something about it so we dont see so many boosted players. If anything people who pay for exp boost would be at a disadvantage as they level up faster before ranked = less experience in game itself.

hma2fhb,MyGasYourBrain,11/27/2021,1,9.0,Strong disagree about tear items overall. Fimbulwinter is nice since it scales from current and maximum mana (HP/Shield) this means you get another use for your mana just by building it. Its not really for stacking mana items adding additional ones (like FH) just gets you another small boost. Looking at it from a stacking mana items perspective is to one-dimensional.

hmbg0gc,Totalwierddude,11/27/2021,1,39.0,I do get your points and although I am someone who usually can have my suspension of disbelief broken kinda easily if somethings off it almost never was with the arcane series.      I will admit though that although the imagine dragons song did fit the scene (not a fan of them btw) having them appear where a band materialised to play the song was a bit too much.  That is the one scene in the show that felt like a shameless plug more than a narrative decision.     I felt most the song choices were very specifically tuned to try get the audience to feel certain emotions and for the most part I believe it worked. I wasnt a fan of every song but they never pulled me out the experience of watching the show.  &#x200B  I actually also liked the Sting song at the end. I will however admit it would have been nice to just have had some normal osts to listen to but I dont think the series suffered by not having them.
hmcd9m7,IainG10,11/27/2021,1,38.0,See Im one of the people who hates FFing but I do actually agree with you I play around Silver and Gold and there are VERY few decided games there so just FFing is bad. Up in D2 I feel most FFs are more justified.

hmcot5x,Dirtymobs,11/27/2021,1,2.0,I took a fresh account to masters in preaseason S10. Guess where i got placed once ranked started? Like D2 and was back to masters in no time.  Preseason rank 100% matters and where you end preseason MMR is where you start the season. High elo players have said and will always say your MMR is what matters and what to care about.

hma3sn8,delahunt,11/27/2021,1,12388.0,Jinx was always going to be a bit problematic in showing the descent hopefully they didnt do it too poorly.  The other part is Jinx from the beginning of episode 1 until Silco tells her she is perfect is obsessed with one thing: being good enough. This is what Mylo is constantly teasing her about in the first two episodes telling Vi that Jinx is 1/2 as good as Vi was at her age and a burden and well a Jinx.  Vi however believes in Powder and Powder wants to prove that she is worthy of that belief in her. Which is why she reacts so strongly to being left behind in Episode 3. Shes told shes not good enough and she wants to prove it. So she goes with the monkey bomb. It is also why she goes from elation (I did it! I saved you!) to despair (I was only trying to help! I was only trying to help!) Unfortunately that is when Vi says Mylo was right hits her then (from Jinxs perspective) abandons her.  Shes taken in by Silco the guy who lives by you have to prove your value by becoming what they fear. And he accepts her but when things go bad you can still see that old fear coming back up. The not good enough countered by the memory of Vi saying shes stronger than she knows and one day will find it. Which is why she goes for the gemstone raid to make up for the mess on the airship.  And that is basically the cycle. She wants to be good enough to be Vis #1 again like before. Only Vi is with Caitlyn. So Vi has moved on. And Silco has his machinations to handle.  And even without the madness just that obsession with wanting to be someones #1 something they wont abandon and discard explains every act Jinx takes. Again until she apologizes to Silco for fucking up again and Silco tells her Dont apologize. Youre perfect.
hmal0ia,Suspicious-Bus6351,11/27/2021,1,79.0,He doesnt. Vipers a completely different person from Nuguri and based off the EDG documentary there was a much greater effort to make him feel comfortable at EDG compared to how FPX treated Nuguri.

More accurately ranged not having enough up front and too much on the back end.  When fully stacked tempo is insane on certain marksmen.

I know you’re just exaggerating but some things can be done to prevent your team from falling THAT far behind.
hmaa63e,_Vastus_,11/27/2021,1,311.0,> Adam: voices his frustrations thoughts and experiences in an online post  If by this you mean: makes an inflammatory tweet where he says that Upsets circumstances are nothing simply because he wasnt told basically forcing Upset to come out and say anything to stop the vitriol thrown his (and his familys) way. Then yeah.  Not to mention that the majority of the body of text was that he felt he did really well and he felt betrayed that they would dare replace him (or look for replacement rather). I dont know how he thinks roster moves are made but usually to obtain a player another has to be removed and this is discussed with the staying players.  Either way I wont say that I cant understand Adam being frustrated but youre painting his post in a whole lot nicer light than it deserves. That post was Adam lashing out because of his frustrations and trying to defame Upset by putting out harmful speculation simply because he felt screwed with no regards of the consequences or what the circumstances may actually be like.   Even if the frustrations make sense his actions were highly immature.
hmb6fyh,JoaoMau-Tempo,11/27/2021,1,,Yes but that is perhaps the best new Lethal Tempo user with a Lulu. Old Lethal Tempo would probably net her the same reason as she would be able to spam more damage faster. There are only few instances where an ADC can actually manage to get 6 autos and feel the need to get the extra range.
hm9w8wz,delahunt,11/27/2021,1,1523.0,Ok so lets go over some basic facts.   Are you missing the part where she was a child? The fact she shouldnt have had those gems in the first place (i.e. Jayce should have had the dangerous illegal research material better secured Vi could have taken them from her or not told her to keep them secret from Vander). Or the fact that she was trying to help save the lives of people who were about to be murdered by a shimmered up rage monster?  Like yes she did the thing. She set off a bomb outside the wall of a secure room to save her sister her father figure and her two friends/brothers. Unfortunately it happened to be a much bigger blast than expected and the chaos from the blast caused fatal injuries.  I am not saying she doesnt have some part to play. But saying she is totally to blame as a child in that fucked up a scenario is kind of extreme. I am also aware that I am talking nuanced here. Like she killed them. Her actions led to their death. The situation just absolves some of the fault in it. It isnt like she intended to kill Mylo and Claggor. And considering what that shimmered up guy did earlier it is easy to see why the need for as big a bang as possible would be considered warranted.   I also think if Ekko knew the whole story hed not hold those deaths against her. I just doubt he ever did get the story.

hm9z0cr,Yusomi-,11/27/2021,1,115.0,Was about to post about this one too.   Since the Rioter requested steps to reproduce:  1. Get an element with W 2. Throw Q at enemy and hit them directly at the end of the basic Q hitbox and the beginning of the empowered Q hitbox. 3. Observe as they take no damage as they pass through an apparent gap in the hitbox.  Also QWQing fast as Qiyana only applies one instance of her passive which is also dogshit and needs fixed. This is likely because the W goes off before the first Q hits and so the newly Wd element has its passive applied and the first Qs element gets lost.  Fixing these bugs would be greatly appreciated.

hm9gajh,Sixcoup,11/27/2021,1,122.0,Not better than Kcorp 1 tho.  Saken > Nuclear Cabo > Adam Rekkles > Xmaty.  If weve got Hantera summer 21 versus Limit summer 21 then Hantera > Limit as well.  Will not judge the jungle because i dont know 113 enough to say anything relevant.  But thats strange to be almost certain an LFL team is better than a LEC one or even more than one in fact.

hm9ey42,Mixed_not_swirled,11/27/2021,1,188.0,No i base my opinion on my own 6 years maining this champ in plat and diamond elo and the opinions of Singed players who are orders of magnitude better than either of us at this game.

hmcbkns,BoJestemRudy,11/27/2021,1,14.0,All event-specific skins such as Voli Kayn and Pantheon will be available for a short period of time in the Prestige Point shop for 100 points each.   The only loss is that buying event skins through the Prestige Point shop wont grant you summoner icon and loading screen border.   Mind you we dont know the future of Prestige skins and whether 2018-2021 skins will be part of this planned unlock for free over long period of time scheme.  We should learn more in the coming 2 weeks maybe already next week when the next patch drops and maybe Prestige Shop gets unlocked.
hmb3ssw,DooMLerD,11/27/2021,1,530.0,Theyd be very similar if they werent separated by 5 decades.
hmbvjyv,Klaymoor11,11/27/2021,1,9.0,IDK if youre using Sudden Impact but its currently bugged and doesnt work on Stealth/Camouflage/Invisibility. Its been like that for a while now and that can affect the damage you do.
hmb2h8b,LoLrovex,11/27/2021,1,341.0,College league scene is definitely still developing but overall its a great experience. People can focus on education and school (how its supposed to work) and even though its not the best its still a starting point. The scene has been growing more and more each year since I got here and its pretty nice to see.
hmb4y8r,gabu87,11/27/2021,1,147.0,First of all youre overreacting he didnt get sent off to pick cotton. He was earning millions playing league.  Secondly you dont feel like he has any responsibility signing on to a roster he didnt gel with?  When youre old enough to get a job you will see the same thing happen in difference workplaces.
hm9aqxx,dazai_airlines,11/27/2021,1,,yep she was always able to drop tower aggro before and this is not the first time she has to deal with this bug. not dropping aggro makes towerdives that much more difficult
hmanqll,PokeD2,11/27/2021,1,476.0,Probs cuz she used that one in her normal Jinx cosplay
hm8wunc,HairClippingJesus,11/27/2021,1,20.0,If you’re playing top play Garen. Easy champion who can still carry hard really good for learning the game. If you’re playing jungle Warwick. Easy champ with a really forgiving yet still fast clear who can again carry hard. Really good for learning jungle. If you’re playing mid Annie has a relatively low skill floor and a pretty high skill ceiling. If you’re playing bot Miss Fortune is a solid pick and you get her from the beginning but if she isn’t to your taste Sivir is very easy and can again hard carry games. If you’re playing support I personally like Sona. If you’re good at MOBAs you should learn pretty quickly and champ knowledge comes naturally with time.
hmbjae1,pconners,11/27/2021,1,81.0,Wonder where it got doge face from for Ionia troll AI. What program or site did you use
hmaqgga,Psychological_Pin494,11/27/2021,1,327.0,Can someone explain why is vayne considered weak early? Everyone seems to say this but I dont see how. Not as pwerful as trist maybe but she seems anything but weak unless ypu consider lvl3 mid game
hmalw3s,Zanethethiccboi,11/27/2021,1,476.0,She’s done it she’s won at Jinx cosplaying.
hma5owz,kupukapow,11/27/2021,1,4.0,I went through this last year. I dont really know exactly what happened but I just couldnt win. Id win one in ever 6 maybe? And every game I won was mostly just pure luck and being carried.  For me I just had to stop playing ranked because it was impossible to be in the right mental. I just went into norms and played random champions I thought would be fun. I would just play random champs and just sort of dick around until I actually wanted to win again.  After that I went back to ranked once I had my drive back. It kind of sucked to not be able to play ranked but after a while it went away and I started winning again.
hm9g93u,yehiko,11/27/2021,1,21.0,are you saying these were created with 0 description other than just the name?
hmaj5l8,HostJoyner,11/27/2021,1,87.0,He’s good player who excels at laning but his positioning is just horrendous. Poor man/Theshy. To his defense most carry players CANNOT play weak side. IMO Zoom being the best at this might be just TES needs.

hm98xpw,Frozen_Watcher,11/27/2021,1,103.0,I dunno dude I would take asking what about us and thinking about the other girl you just met in less than a week in showering as more obvious indications of romantic interest than calling someone sweet as cupcake which the other guy suggested to be more undeniable.

hma8k4i,Coolestdude123,11/27/2021,1,,And rather than a conciliatory response from Upset he just gas lights it all and plays the victim.  Upset could have just said:  I am really sorry you guys had to go through all that at worlds. Maybe we could have all handled it better. I had some serious family shit and had to go home. Really sorry how negatively it impacted all you guys. Best of luck for the future.  Instead Upset just gas lights it.
hmbbc08,IAmNotOnRedditAtWork,11/27/2021,1,125.0,The soul is fine. Im talking just about the map changes. The gates are way more obnoxious than the fog.
hmatzm4,ColdXStrikeR,11/27/2021,1,65.0,I mean 3rd or 4rth drake depends on when you start you could end up fighting for soul at 25 mins. That is not late game imo. Its about 2-3 items in.
hmcobgs,Dirtymobs,11/27/2021,1,13.0,Ah youre thinking about this wrong. The system is set up to soft-reset everyone and if you win 50% of your games it takes like 50 games to get back to your rank when it was reset.  If youre silver 4 youll be reset to bronze somewhere. Play and win ~50% of your games? Youll be back to silver 4 in ~50 games.  If youre bronze 4? Youll be reset to iron and same deal where youll get back to bronze 4 in like 50 games.  Keep playing keep trying keep improving. Stop worrying about this arbitrary rank imrpove your skillset and the rank will go up.
hmbh9c4,KingFIRe17,11/27/2021,1,7.0,Its hilarious playing a champ like hecarim into ahri cuz you just end up sprinting it down whenever you get charmed.

hm9wsix,yp261,11/27/2021,1,425.0,„most people have multiple smurfs” source: trust me bro  you underestimate the amount of casual players who dont give a shit about anything you are saying. n  we are playing for 8+ we were kicked from EUW when they removed our currency from the store and gave us a free transfer. we don’t have smurfs cause we are too old for this shit and we have no time for it.
hmcx81t,IlDaydreamIl,11/27/2021,1,20.0,Im not saying adcs should kill tanks 1v1. Im merely saying tanks shouldnt kill adcs with a single combo. If tank beats adc like your example it should be with cc and sustained dmg. Not dealing 2400 dmg with 1 combo in 7 seconds.

That in and of itself does not in any way directly imply that Orianna is that daughter.  Ill admit though I havent read up on more recent lore/stories so Id love someone to enlighten me if theres more evidence besides that line.

hma6d13,greekcel_25,11/27/2021,1,29.0,I can understand nuguri is probably homesick going through some rough stuff on FPX and possibly not as hungry for a repeat as some of the FPX players are but giving up on the championship after 1 split and then just not talking or listening to your team is toxic af for a team environment. Dude is probably getting a 7 figure salary just do your best ffs.
hmabvt1,Frothar,11/27/2021,1,311.0,it doesnt help that the people are being deliberately obtuse. acting like the only options are leave without saying anything and tell them everything. He could easily of made them aware more than 12 hours before and there are ways to convey the severity of the situation without compromising privacy.  Adam could voice his frustrations without putting a target on Upset by making up a reason for the departure and speculating about how the acquisition of a new toplaner occurred

hmcy4jb,IlDaydreamIl,11/27/2021,1,20.0,There is always that one guy who tried to see the nitpick in everything. Would you like if I refered to it as a really fast 100-0 instead of a oneshot?  3 of those 7 seconds were me running away from him after flash and galeforce. He killed me after that. 7 seconds total since combat started until I died. 4 seconds of real combat. Idk I took a habit of refering to something as oneshot if a champ kills another really fast. And I see people doing the same pretty often.  In most games the term oneshot is rarely used anymore to refer to an actual death in 1 single hit.

hmb909j,LesserManatee08,11/27/2021,1,125.0,The reason Aatroxs revive was removed was because it provided too much safety when you were being dove by people and then it was also way too strong when diving the enemy and you were guaranteed a revive.  It was a similar case with Panths E shield blocking turret shots it warped his gameplay so much that he was incredibly good at tower diving. They also removed this interaction for the health of the game.

hma29o2,Party-47,11/27/2021,1,126.0,>I believe the damage of her ult goes off right as her untargetability ends so she does reset tower aggro momentarily but then gets it again due to her ult damage going off on the champ.  Wait that also means that if someone damages the enemy champion during her ult cast it is fine? So against something with a lot of Dots (lets say Liandrys Zyra with multiple plants out) she should get the toweraggro reset at least sometimes.  Interesting.

hmab7he,XiaoRCT,11/27/2021,1,313.0,family emergency simply doesnt cover enough. You explain to your team what happened.   Id bet on a lot of people being mad if family emergency for leaving his team hanging at worlds meant my wifes grandma passed away and she was having a tough time because it would be a shitty reason. Obviously family emergency might also mean something way more tragic that would justify Upsets position.   The issue is exactly how vague it is not for us the public but for his own team at the time.

hm9b8yr,Raynar7,11/27/2021,1,27.0,Jesus poor Tencent will soon get blamed for everything.   Anyway what you and many other people do not consider is the fact that with any skin - yes even winter skin for SR - Riot would have big trouble with champions skins and their clarity.   There are plenty of skins that are basically P2W on ARAM (winter map) because of how the map looks.  I know it’s hard to understand that but skins for champs > skins for map that most of people would turn off anyway since they are used to normal SR.
hmd2757,teerude,11/27/2021,1,78.0,Didnt you just flame him?  You can literally say the same sentiment with saying he is looking pretty weak.  I mean.  He is still green and learning its obvious.  The flame is pointing out the obvious no matter how much you try to sugar coat the rest after.
hmao1n6,iamgnahk,11/27/2021,1,6.0,Im gonna make Claggors goggles.
hmav94q,LeFiery,11/27/2021,1,149.0,Reason the snow map dont and wont exist (anymore) is because of the drakes. For something once a year its too much work to keep it updated. It probably means every new pre-season were gonna get new drakes every year.   For the rest of the stuff who fucking knows. Theyve been saying the same shit for years. Maybe with the success of arcane well start seeing that kinda thing.   Also snowdown skins apparently proved to be meh-selling skins so they stopped and changed it to other themes.

hmajlds,slfthrowaway12345,11/27/2021,1,79.0,I watched the documentary in Chinese. Seems like they are just trying to pin problems on Nuguri this whole time. It was said in interviews that Nuguri acted this way on DK too. He is just an extremely antisocial dude and had a history of getting bullied - there is no way FPX management didnt know this prior to acquiring him. There were so many problems with FPX this year but I guess hes the perfect scapegoat since hes not coming back to the LPL anymore. Is it his responsibility as an adult to own up to his decision of coming to China and doing the best he can to live up to his 7-figs salary? Absolutely and he should have done better to overcome his demons but if anyone thinks its only his fault and doesnt think this is a problem with the coaching staff & management you have not been following what FPX was like this year.  I just feel terrible for Tian. There were so many awkward clips of him trying to cheer up Nuguri throughout the video & him getting ignored throughout the documentary lmfao.  Also if anyones gonna talk about stuff like Nuguri not willing to learn Chinese to communicate with the team I fully agree that players like Tarzan/Viper who went from not knowing Chinese to being able to shotcall in comms within a matter of months are fking fantastic but expecting everyone to become fluent in Chinese in a few months while practicing League 16+ hours a day is not realistic. Keep in mind even TheShy was not fluent in Chinese and had to rely on Rookie to translate in game during S8 and IG was able to win at Worlds sooooooo...again could Nuguri have done better? I agree he could have. But is becoming fluent & being able to shotcall a realistic expectation? I dont think so.

hmbx8q4,Xonra,11/27/2021,1,196.0,Its even more annoying trying to not just auto loss against it. If you are behind there is no more coming back if they get Chem Dragon soul you are just fucked. You are guaranteed to never win another team fight unless the enemy team is literally trolling and trying to lose. You can just ignore elder and baron the rest of the game and force fights cause you win.
hm99lfn,WintersEnvoy,11/27/2021,1,6.0,Jgl or Mid     Supps not that impactful but its pretty easy to learn and play and supps youll face will (often) be legitimately a lower caliber of players than in other roles especially pre dia
hmajigp,fnlbss,11/27/2021,1,12401.0,>Riot has explicitly mentioned    >   >not   >   > to treat Arcane like its connected to the game   If this is true than sure but as far as Im concerned this is the new canon. Seems like Caitlyns new VO is explicitly crafted around arcane.

hmcymz8,DuhChappers,11/27/2021,1,30.0,Not sure they should even name an ace for the last game that was brutal.   Sniper looking pretty weak against a top tier player good experience for him though. I hope no one flames him or gives up on him as a prospect because one of the best top laners in NA shat on him. Im still looking forward to his growth a lot for sure.

hm98cca,liamera,11/27/2021,1,34.0,I was hoping for more depth than recent anecdotal experience. :S   54% WR is definitely a strong champion but just saying they carried in a bunch of your recent matches doesnt really explain 54% at all.

hmaer4t,OilOfOlaz,11/27/2021,1,,> urgent family emergency is not enough cause that is so vague it tells you nothing thats the kind of excuse you give your teacher when you are skipping class you dont have to tell them everything but just enough that they can picture themselves in that situation and say yeah ok i would do the same so that they know its justified and they didnt just waste a year of their lives.  Well DL played a competitive match of LOL a couple of hours after his brother killed his parents Im pretty sure that I never would have said I would do the same under these circumstances and so other players might not have understood why he thought he left.   For me its kinda weird that you value the privacy of his famaly less then a working relatuionship. He also told Yamato who in turn thought that it was legit and let him leave.  Obviously you are free to not be sadisfied with the explonation but its still immature to go on record and slender your former teammate for that and him talking to another former teammate.
hmabcxv,MaleQueef,11/27/2021,1,101.0,A winter dragon would probably have an ocassional blizzard in the game every few minutes in the objectives and jungle where Ability Haste and Attack Speed is reduced.

hma5yjr,Quirky_Lychee_693,11/27/2021,1,47.0,so you say that wanting to surrender lacks empathy towards people that dont want to ff.  and casually ignore that refusing to surr lacks empathy towards people who want to surr.  game already needs 4/5 people to agree to surr. And never surr crowd is still whining because they think that their voice should outweigh LITERALLY THE ENTIRE REST OF THE TEAM.  Who lacks empathy here?  EDIT: also analogy not being perfect does not make it bad. Just like people who want to leave force other people to leave people who want to stay force other people to stay. It cancels out. Except never surrender crowd gets an advantage (2 no votes outweigh 3 yes) and have a superiority complex.
hmc57hh,DragonsThatFly,11/27/2021,1,285.0,I would not be surprised in the slightest if Faker was in Arcane in some way. I mean if Imagine Dragons are technically in the lore why not Faker.

hmav0m2,CzarcasticX,11/27/2021,1,112.0,Lets look at total Worlds winners since 2013 I wont count subs like Easyhoon Blank Duke etc even though theyre technically Worlds Winners  SKT (5 Koreans)  Samsung W (5 Koreans)  SKT (5 Koreans)  SKT (5 Koreans)  Samsung G (5 Koreans)  IG (2 Koreans 3 Chinese)  FPX (2 Koreans 3 Chinese)  DK (5 Koreans)  EDG (2 Koreans 3 Chinese)  36 Koreans 9 Chinese.  Chinese league gets strengthened by taking young Korean talent pool + veterans while Korean league gets weakened by talent pool going to China NA EU Japan and others. At least this year not that many from LCK went abroad except for 4-5 players but you still have strong people like Viper Tarzan Scout Kanavi Summit etc in other leagues.
hmb0zib,johnnyxmas16,11/27/2021,1,16.0,I tried reverse boosting on ARAM doesnt seem to work. Mmr on old accounts is fucked. Every now and then riot will hand you an easy win usually after a long break from the game
hmcn5or,LumiRhino,11/27/2021,1,120.0,My comment was moreso in regards to the fact that Spica would even consider a champ he hates. If hes full on try hard he would only go for his comfort/practiced picks.

hmd2x95,BobaFlautist,11/27/2021,1,7.0,Its always been so weird to me that people complain about flat pen hitting the threshold of true damage. Why is it worse for a champion to buy a bunch of flat pen and do true damage to someone without resistances than for them to buy a bunch of ap and do the same damage after base resistances?  The one thing is flat pen hits its optimal damage amp when it exactly matches a champions resistances so I guess thats the point at which its most efficient but if you buy a null-magic mantle thats no longer the case.  If you were warning that specifically high base-damage mages are going to be hitting squishies really hard that would be one thing but are there really any mages/ap assassins that rely mostly on base damage these days? Im not saying flat pen isnt sometimes tuned to be better than ap but whats the obsession with whether or not theyll happen to exactly hit the true damage threshold?
hmbcjix,UndeadMurky,11/27/2021,1,125.0,From the winning pov yes but from the losing team pov going from 9% win to 13% is huge thats nearly +50% chance to win.

hm9ztr4,Shenstar2o,11/27/2021,1,21.0,I am 26 and past 3 pre-seasons i have not played. Taking time of has been very good for me. It totally depends on your life situation and what you want.  Played 1500 ranked games in season 3 & 4 afterwards perhaps 300 a year.   Nowadays i play with friends or play aram when bored.   So some weeks i play good 50 games and other times i dont play for weeks.   Do you have fun playing and do you have time to play are probably the best questions to ask yourself.
hm92nj1,MonoTheteus,11/27/2021,1,39.0,I was in a game against udyr ADC owning my bot lane I was jungle nasus. Only thing I can recommend honestly just pick someone that scales to heaven’s pearly gates and two shot him because you went duskblade with 1.6k stacks at 45.

hm9r84d,SaulJoker,11/27/2021,1,11.0,What I’m saying is that why didn’t they download OBS and record the live game that way instead of with their phone.  What you said was that they should just use replay which is fine but they cannot access the replay of a game that isn’t finished can they?  Obviously they can just wait for the game to end and then share the replay but the point is that if you’re going to record DURING THE GAME it would have been better to use recording software than to record with the phone.

hmd2o2q,LordGoatIII,11/27/2021,1,320.0,Could be snow drifts replace certain bushes like the one between blue buff and river that allows players to walk through the terrain maybe in one direction like the pile of snow is so big that it covers the trees and forms a big hill of traversal snow but it slows you down while you are on it.  Could be ice sheets that floats down the river creating moving terrain just have to solve the issues of where it comes from and where it goes.   Could be icebergs that form from the walls in side lanes like shifting glaciers. And something else like maybe the mid lane river bushes are replaced by ice that has flowed down river from either lane cutting off the most direct route from mid to river.
hmcbk0q,LanternWolf,11/27/2021,1,48.0,Reading her kda lore will give you a better idea. Seraphine is supposed to be the harmony between China and America. She is a Chinese girl who grew up in LA.

hmaatwc,ikingjosh,11/27/2021,1,12395.0,I forgot about the exchange between Jinx and Silco after hes shot.  That does explain it a little better.  Whats frustrating is I can no longer sympathize with both Vi and Jinx re the breaking of the relationship.  Either its Jinxs fault  jumping to conclusions about how Vi feels about her now (Vi seemed totally sincere at the dinner table) and choosing this  alternative narrative in her head.  Or its Vis fault:  Her urgency to be with Jinx after getting out of jail seemed inadequate to me and the way the bridge scene ended seemed like she was writing off Jinx walking away from her with Caitlyn.  Also the punch at the end of act 1 seemed totally overdone even for what Powder did.  Its like theyre both unlikable now
hmb325a,SaulJoker,11/27/2021,1,,But then you get melted by % hp damage right? Because you’re stacking health? Sure you can argue you’d take less % physical damage but that doesn’t stop % hp magic damage (*cough* Liandry’s *cough* Demonic). You’d get shut down by any AP champion who can avoid you getting to close to them or even other AP Juggernauts like Mord.  I take it the main champs you play are Nasus and Cho yes? On those champions it makes sense to buy Thornmail and Nasus is the only one that’s unable to benefit from the 60% grievous so I understand your frustration in that regard.   But the item is fine it’s a TANK item and tanks are expected to have CC to compensate their lack of damage output. Juggernauts compensate their lack of CC with damage. Nasus is in a weird spot where he doesn’t really want chempunk because he just wants to be tanky as he scales infinitely but he doesn’t really want thornmail either because he can’t apply the 60% grievous wounds.  The solution in coordinated play is to play an enchanter alongside Nasus and have them build putrifier. But of course this is less applicable in SoloQ.  And no there is no argument for Darius to not build Chempunk. His passive literally synergizes perfectly witth it. The only scenario where I could see it working is vs. a literal full AD team that has little to no magic damage and even then you’re probably better off getting a different armor item.
hm9m0tz,_truecode_,11/27/2021,1,47.0,They didnt do one last year either right? I dont get it.. winter rolls around every year its not like someone all of a sudden sprung winter on them and theyre like well golly this is so unexpected!!!!
hmcxjvk,KeyserJ,11/27/2021,1,58.0,Theres the point too that even with her gauntlets Vi still has an exposed body with human limitations and human weak points and as powerful as they are her gauntlets can still break (as seen in her fight against Sevika).
hm9ub6e,SaulJoker,11/27/2021,1,20.0,It’s not about Tear it’s about resourceless champions being able to buy shit like Luden’s/Frozen Heart and be way more effective with those items than champions that actually utilize the mana.  And then they’ll have to make the numbers so low that the item is just not worth buying anyways.  Don’t even get me started on the ridiculous amount of bugs it would cause with champions like Viego Modekaiser and Sylas.

hmbepmm,OneDrunkDonut,11/27/2021,1,364.0,Hi! Which role did you find the easiest to climb with especially in lower elo? thx.
hm9mkhj,Ronizu,11/27/2021,1,,Collector deals 5% max HP (at maximum assuming that the damage you took put you at perfectly 5% hp). I dont know which champions you play but I at least dont play champions that have 40000 max HP (the amount required for 5% to be 2000 true damage).
hmbsr40,fabton12,11/27/2021,1,25.0,The issue with mana conversion to say HP is that certain items have really strong effects that are gated by certain stats. lets take frozen heart for example frozen heart has a shit ton of armour but no HP meaning its not as a effective as a lower resistence item that has HP.  Giving it the HP conversion now its openned up to manaless champs but now its only going to get abused if the conversion is good and if it isnt good then instead it means there no point in the HP conversion in the first place like there isnt any manaless Tank tanks. so all it would be used by are people abusing it if the conversion is good and if it isnt good then no manaless champ would buy them leading to no reason in having the mana conversion in the first place.  Theres issues with adding more mana items but i agree there needs to be more of them like there so little options when really there should be a decent selection of them like atleast 1-2 more for the different classes. That way once you got your tear item you have a choice of if you want to invest in more mana or other stats and effects.

hmaxlip,Raynar7,11/27/2021,1,446.0,“Virtually” maybe in reality there is. The reason for the split were just servers collapsing all the time
hm8xoja,JujyPop,11/27/2021,1,9.0,spica and tactical are so fun together
hmb7peg,DooMLerD,11/27/2021,1,52.0,ArcaneXThanos
hmc62xz,ReverseDead,11/27/2021,1,,And this is a shining example of an individual who gets way too attached to a company because they enjoy a product that they produce. You need to separate your feelings from the business practices of the company that makes your hobby. I love league as much as the next guy. wasted 11 years of my life on it. And spent 1000s of dollars that I shouldnt have growing up on skins. Is it nice that riot gives us skins from loot boxes? Sure yeah free stuff is free stuff. But dont let it cover for the fact that they have steadily been making more and more corrosive business decisions that are implemented to just make as much money as possible. I love league of legends. And because of that I want it to be the best it can possibly be. But Im not blind or letting myself be bribed by  shiney free skins and in game currency that amounts to nothing.  Riot/tencent has the agency to be better. To foster a more inclusive environment for their employees. But they dont. Do you know why? Because they have hundreds if not thousands of people like you who go to bat for them. You should be critical you should be outspoken. Why? Because thats the sign of passion. Help them be the best they can be.
hm9y8b4,Ass_borger,11/27/2021,1,14.0,They were just having a bad game
hmafs77,5ait5,11/27/2021,1,81.0,5 years ago + carried by ruler + corejj cant win lcs with stacked af rosters for 2 years in a row
hm9c97k,Halleckss,11/27/2021,1,63.0,There is an other one. I have noticed that she can one shot every champ in one rotation even when they are full tank.
hmbsw3l,ExecutionerOfGula,11/27/2021,1,236.0,Same reasons why Riot still doesn’t have a practice tool to try all champs announcer packs and seeing what the champ abilities do in champ select .. they dgaf. They can easily implement this like all other mobas but don’t want to.
hmd8frd,Righteousretainer,11/27/2021,1,535.0,Diamond
hma3okr,promethvzine,11/27/2021,1,6.0,i had no clue this was a thing thanks a lot! bit of getting used to though.
hm9pd6v,rimidalv25,11/27/2021,1,1538.0,not all cc youre just displacement immune
hm965gy,wenasi,11/27/2021,1,23.0, >Obviously missiles that are already spawned (e.g. Xerath E after his cast time completed) persist even if their caster dies. Most of them at least.  Cries in Draven
hma8l72,TTerragore,11/27/2021,1,7.0,This looos amazing!!!!!! You got this just right I absolutely love it!!!!   Jinx has been my favorite legend since she was added and it’s been such a pleasure to see all the amazing talented people who have come up with amazing art pieces or cosplay! Thanks for putting this out there! bless
hmc93wo,Ok_Resident_6643,11/27/2021,1,222.0,Exactly this then they will finally remove/rework it next year after we complained and memed about it
hm9xrbi,SleepyLabrador,11/27/2021,1,8.0,Tits or Ass?
hmbdro4,Kadde-,11/27/2021,1,11.0,Personally im gonna wait since I gain 12 lp and lose 18. Just really demotivating to play with those gains.

hma983g,Zapor666,11/27/2021,1,15.0,When how about rip off ALL dashes frod adc and delete ability to self peeling for everyone? Why EVERY champ in game have a multiple pros and only Kog doesnt?
hmcjh5l,Zudoarie,11/27/2021,1,1.0,That was damn good
hmbv0z9,no_please_no_not_now,11/27/2021,1,4.0,Doombots  old Aram
hmbvrg8,DooMLerD,11/27/2021,1,63.0,Garen similar in a way to Paladin/Warrior in WoW. Also worth mentioning Darius both play in similar ways but Garen is a bit more noob friendly.
hmd8alq,Righteousretainer,11/27/2021,1,535.0,Diamond
hmcut2q,Nottadoctor,11/27/2021,1,529.0,Yeah I thought he was talking about the *Verified* Akali interview about MORE. I dont mind the KDA stuff.
hm8xbdn,Deidarac5,11/27/2021,1,12.0,Literally every team has a current player in the LCS lol. Id say only doublelift has a weak team on paper if he doesnt preform.
hm9yvyn,ProteinPancake5,11/27/2021,1,51.0,So did Riot.
hmat4mc,BBQMasterDad,11/27/2021,1,23.0,Billion dollar champion btw
hm91bfy,MyboiHarambe99,11/27/2021,1,4.0,Shen and zed would be a good one
hm99ob1,Umba360,11/27/2021,1,236.0,Mom: we got Tyler1 at home  The Tyler1 at home:
hmco1sb,Tzeenht,11/27/2021,1,162.0,Twitch yasuo senna
hmb39pi,Rodrake,11/27/2021,1,13.0,Back in my days people would suplex trains in videogames not the other way around
hmcnz2o,OP_IzzoR,11/27/2021,1,113.0,no one cares about some ad if you buy it simply for cdr reasons and the passive that makes every champ with a long cooldown broken. Hell even Karthus is building it. So i dont see how you think the item is ok
hmc2195,color_shot,11/27/2021,1,,Im still waiting for the Irelia/Ionia series. They shove her lore down my face with the voice lines so I figured itll come out eventually 😂
hm9v7tw,Jon_Aegon_Targaryen,11/27/2021,1,288.0,/u/Littlejem
hm96v7i,yeeyeeAssMidlaner,11/27/2021,1,5.0,I feel like that should ve the final series. Jax gathering everyone we saw from previous seasons to fight against the Void
hm8w1n0,Braunze,11/27/2021,1,20.0,Like others have said try the free ones and ar lvl 11 youll get access to the weekly rated free champions before 11 its a set few Champs all the time.  Also on lvl up you can get champion shards which will let you unlock them at half the regular blue essence cost.  So if you get shards find the champion spotlight on YouTube of it and see if it looks fun.
hmc9xgz,Crazynaro,11/27/2021,1,40.0,Roadu Rolla da!!!
hmaueml,Ceramicrabbit,11/27/2021,1,170.0,Thats what he always did though
hmbq38m,VeritasCicero,11/27/2021,1,225.0,The issue with your whole premise will always be the tech part. Technology by definition is not naturally occurring.   Chemicals naturally occur. Add magic and you might have chemomancy. Iron naturally occurs. Find someone to manipulate it and you have metalomancy or something.  But when you add tech you imply an act of will that mixed and developed things to a specific advanced state. That doesnt naturally occur.
hmc67lv,NattyGainz,11/27/2021,1,277.0,Yo be fair in my country it hasn’t snowed for a good few years either. So maybe riot is just keeping it real with global warming and all
hmbp16q,Xaxzer,11/27/2021,1,70.0,Yea using a clip that is entirely pykes kit and then missing an ult on an already dead champ is actually good evidence that this item is broken.
hmb431v,Squarefighter,11/27/2021,1,206.0,Or they just dont take to reddit to complain about preseason
hm99bbe,Manus2002,11/27/2021,1,150.0,Predator eve is good
hm9cb70,AureaMediocritas1,11/27/2021,1,15.0,??? his r healing got nerfed and his overall dmg got nerfed
hmabh1i,FraggerDaddy,11/27/2021,1,16.0,Its mostly the shit game dont play it! (hours played:10034) people that do this
hm9hbsb,YUNG_GOD_X,11/27/2021,1,585.0,Is this true? What about Zed ult and Darius passive?
hmaqd0f,Suspicious-Bus6351,11/27/2021,1,98.0,Scout and ShowMaker didn’t build Abyssal when they played Malz. Also the old passive only activated on immobilizes and Malz only has one. It’s just not a very good item for Malz.
hmcm8fg,Pretend-Indication-9,11/27/2021,1,162.0,Ashe sona poppy
hma1oam,NO_FNX_NO_MAJOR,11/27/2021,1,59.0,> This doesnt inherently make him an aa based assassin.  but he is an aa based assassin. Look HoB isnt ideal on Rengar you are completely correct but what is with this misinformation? Most of his damage literally comes from an auto attack. No he isnt a carry but thats not what you said for the first part of your sentence. Yes Talon and Zed have impactful autos but its not most of their damage unlike Rengar.  > HoB. is. trash. I dont even have to say HoB is trash on rengar its just fucking trash on its own. Its only playable on like kalista twitch tryndamere.  Kaisa and Tristana as well. In fact they have the exact same reason for going it as AP Twitch so surely you dont disagree right? otherwise you are spreading more misinformation. It also was the best rune on Ashe for a while (not sure since preseason) and viable on Varus and Draven.  > Rengar builds maybe one crit item and he doesnt build it for the crit  Its not a maybe he does built a crit item. And he does build more crit items often. Its the most reliable way of one shotting someone mid to late game  >Crit is an objectively bad stat on rengar. It performs poorly. This isnt debatable. Its in the stats.  Every stat site Ive ever been on shows crit performing well on Rengar later into the game (obviously go lethality to start). Even high elo players build it. You are completely wrong on this.

hmc2rn6,IWillNameMyChildZoe,11/27/2021,1,21.0,Its Ahris back. You can see hair in the upper part and her tails in the lower part
hmckyf4,Ramus_N,11/27/2021,1,103.0,Varus Swain and Zyra in that order.  Are you plat?
hmbcxbt,Jozex21,11/27/2021,1,263.0,yeah i believe people are abusing glitches.
hmb5ger,Liteboyy,11/27/2021,1,8.0,It’s actually a play on the name of a pro SMITE player that I was a big fan of “SoloOrTroll” also called SOT.
hmc1inr,MakovBest,11/27/2021,1,40.0,Pathetic last time i played against cho gath who had 19 stacks and 10k hp
hm9sglx,Tanriyung,11/27/2021,1,8.0,Because they are significant characters in Arcane so many new players might be interested in playing them.
hm99gki,percyallennnn,11/27/2021,1,37.0,SofM would probably fit K9 and any of the ADs really well considering how good he is at playing support-jungle champs.
hm9sz03,Lucky_Yolo,11/27/2021,1,8.0,What is the change that Arcane has made? Is it just the look?
hm9s0tj,Lordsammeh,11/27/2021,1,18.0,Ap shyvana with any ap nythic lich bane and nashors does nuts damage to objectives
hmctcsd,Exmerus,11/27/2021,1,47.0,Is Rakkan supposed to be strong too?
hmb91qs,youngarchivist,11/27/2021,1,,you must have either a massive target on your back or live in one of the most toxic environments possible  Im genuinely sorry if thats been your experience but most communities arent like that.
hma4kad,hiccup333,11/27/2021,1,12388.0,The dinner scene felt so stilted to force the ending we saw.  Felt like it came at the expense of both Vi and Jinxs character and the expense of a satisfying story
hmbfx9m,NymphomaniacWalrus,11/27/2021,1,303.0,This is true for bruisers as well though. LT is noticeably worse late game for them compared to Conqueror.  I do think its sad that adcs dont really have a late game option for keystones right now though.
hmd4nfs,Izento,11/27/2021,1,274.0,Yeah should be like a GA kind of timeout.
hm9a0l1,Xyrazk,11/27/2021,1,191.0,What role does he main? I have a hardstuck Bronze friend who reminds me of how you describe your friend. What Ive gathered from watching him play is that he autopilots when playing support which is why he keeps playing the role.  He wants to reach gold so he can get Victorious Skin but doesnt want to have to think when he plays. He just sees what his ADC is doing and mirrors it. Also he doesnt understand win conditions and when he loses he just blames broken champs and op items.
hmcimoh,Zudoarie,11/27/2021,1,3.0,Nice one
hmao0dy,Fun_Carrot6597,11/27/2021,1,219.0,I have no personal feelings about a random American ex-pro gamer at all but I can see plenty of reasons why LCS orgs won’t touch him. Reinforced by the fact that they indeed will not sign him.
hmadcxw,Imperadise,11/27/2021,1,52.0,I mean doinb was considered the best mid in the lpl summer split. Doinb was the best player on that summer squad and nuguri was maybe the 4th
hmby659,After_Signature_6580,11/27/2021,1,23.0,Riot has acted on complaints purely by Reddit before. Its not unprecedented. This sub has 5.5 million members. If 5.5 million players quit the game several regions would be dead and Riots profit margins would suffer greatly. I dont think you thought through your comment.
hma5flv,Samsonkoek,11/27/2021,1,147.0,I respect Upset for doing his own thing but this sort of situation was bound to happen (not with it exploding on twitter but more internally) I think even if Upset doesnt like it in 90% of the cases it is the right call to tell your teammates.  So if he finds it worth to protect the privacy over everything that happend then sure it is his choice but I can imagine most teammates would be frustrated over it.
hmaxeeg,100WattCrusader,11/27/2021,1,65.0,Someone had the stats the other day that it was 3% above the second best soul (hextech) and ~5% above the third and later ones.  Its pretty strong.
hmceh9m,ThusTheFray,11/27/2021,1,58.0,Viktor Yorick Draven
hm9ryit,bronet,11/27/2021,1,226.0,Its a bit funny how they realized they need to tone town the overtly sexual design of Jinx for the show.

hmcfo4k,Proffan,11/27/2021,1,422.0,Go ahead Ive been using it since like s3 and I want more people to pick it up.
hmbu627,iii_natau,11/27/2021,1,5.0,There used to be a “top sellers” tab but it seemed to just be operated by Riot for advertising purposes. i’m pretty sure High Noon Yasuo was just permanently #1 if i remember correctly
hmcn7ik,Lucavii,11/27/2021,1,299.0,You sound like a child throwing a tantrum.  Im not a riot apologist Im an adult who realizes that paying money to a company doesnt make them subservient to my whims
hma6hfh,AsahiMizunoThighs,11/27/2021,1,27.0,I thought the score was a little OTT at times (but I tend to think less is more in storytelling anyway) but this made me realize how shit the Netflix mixing was on my end. The music was dope overall and Arcane is the best thing about League. Which is both good and sad
hmd1pwa,DruidCrimson,11/27/2021,1,9.0,Dragon pet... Endless Shield... Almost full heal in 2nd Skill... Burst damage in 1st skill...
hm9t2nv,Lucky_Yolo,11/27/2021,1,8.0,So they make new champion videos for old champions every now and then? How often does that happen?

hm9j5e9,GR3MN,11/27/2021,1,59.0,Just had my first game against enemy team who had chemtech soul. Oof... maybe the most unfun and miserable thing I have had to deal with in league teamfights ever in my ten years of playing the game... I cant even see how they could balance this instant delete gg.
hmd9a7x,DagrMine,11/27/2021,1,535.0,A little late but Pyke Shaco Azir
hmbvxpv,BringBackAH,11/27/2021,1,236.0,Tencent has been owning riot since season 1. Why does everyone ranting post keeps bringing Tencent to the table I still dont get it
hmbiwxj,My_Audience_Awaits,11/27/2021,1,10.0,Maybe its your cc score idk what support you were playing but 6 is far too low for most supports.

hmcvzbs,EONNephilim,11/27/2021,1,94.0,Garena has a really shitty emote thats only available here. It includes the Garena logo on a party hat worn by a poro IIRC. That was given out like 3 or more months ago.
hma3hkl,GGABueno,11/27/2021,1,58.0,Not Bandle City
hm9dp4g,TH3RM4L33,11/27/2021,1,,I noticed Warwicks R doesnt either. Dunno if bug or not but I am happy about it. There is Imo way too much stealth reveal in the game.
hma7581,Exclarius,11/27/2021,1,145.0,How is this a problem? If youre going through something will you spend 24 hours a day hyperfocusing on it or will you try to distract yourself?
hm8w1v1,Zombra808,11/27/2021,1,20.0,Viego passive has special properties because it would be too broken if he reset tower agro. All untargetabilities should remove tower agro aside from Viego passive.
hma8ntr,Conker184,11/27/2021,1,,TIL every person who has ever retired is a weak willed piece of trash.
hmc0fp5,Tundra_Hunter_OCE,11/27/2021,1,248.0,Gragas is my second OTP (first is Trundle) I play Gragas mostly support (my second role) or jungle (if Trundle is banned/picked). As Gragas night harvester is better than luden imo. So you dont get the flat pen from luden.  As a support you dont have much gold and thus you want gold efficient items. Hextech Alternator has a great build path and is great on burst champion like Grag AP/pen build.  So I love to build: sorcs night harvester horizon focus shadowflame. All have hextech alternator is the build making build path amazing. Also you dont waste shadowflame pen since you build night harvester and not luden. I grab void staff 4th item but usually games end before that. Rabadon last.
hmcup3m,itsr1co,11/27/2021,1,332.0,Rengar Lee and Zed.
hmaahs1,ConscienceNot,11/27/2021,1,62.0,I am not gonna bother replying to each specific comment because to everything applies that you are completely clueless. Youdont even fkin play the champion you dont even know such basic thing as that Rengar this season is played into full crit with one lethality item and one mythic lethality item and you try to talk about something that requires understanding.  >q combo... which hasnt been possible for YEARS. You dont even play the game anymore LMAO!  This just killed milions of braincells of whoever read this. Jesus christ. Fk off. You re so wrong its unbelievable and undescribable by words alone. You are so wrong there is no way you actually mean it unless you are paid actor for trolling.  HoB is great and works better than electro in my games. Its raw power is better than electro has better CD and still allows that juicy burst. You wont have better burst midair but most targets either die regardless or survive with more HP than electro does as damage.
hmb9073,00Dandy,11/27/2021,1,38.0,Sure thats why I said >online< game.   &#x200B  >you can play it all the time and it never gets old because there is no story finale or max level.   >   > its a game everybody can play. Its F2P and even runs on shitty notebooks.  These things apply to MANY games yet LoL seems  to be the clear number 1 in terms of playerbase and overall interest like esports viewership for example. Even though LoL has been released in 2009.
hm9egdc,Ha_Ree,11/27/2021,1,77.0,I dont think or at least I hope the exclamation mark for being revealed by non-champions isnt a bug and is a new change to stealth because it can sometimes be hard to spot if you have been revealed or not by pinks and the exclamation mark is way visually clearer  Also the turret aggro reset has been in the game for months at least its happened to me in games for a long while
hm99gd2,musashihokusai,11/27/2021,1,31.0,Very high ceiling on this team. Hope this roster stays together for more than a year.
hm9f03g,iMidg3t,11/27/2021,1,372.0,I felt the same playing on EUNE minus the queue time.
hmb5x81,IHateReddit_9001,11/27/2021,1,626.0,A player who is placed on the appropriate place in the mmr rating will have in the long run 50% win rate. Except at literally the very top of the ladder winrate doesn’t tell you in absolute terms how good or bad someone is just how appropriate their current mmr is. If your teammates are also diamond and 50% winrate then they’re a perfectly appropriate match to make to your mmr.
hmb9fnf,shaidyn,11/27/2021,1,9.0,I think when league first started the idea was Demacia good Noxus bad. Things have evolved over time and become more grey.  These days Demacia is a good kingdom as long as you follow the rules and dont use magic and Noxus is a good kingdom as long as youre willing to go to any lengths to prove yourself stronger than your peers.  Noxians probably think Noxus is great. The people getting rolled over by Noxus probably not so much.

hmasfyw,RiftHunter4,11/27/2021,1,23.0,Her E? Back in my day (like 3 pat hes ago) Lux just used her Ult to poke because you could get the CD down to 15s.
hmcxe1n,Bodywithoutorgans18,11/27/2021,1,332.0,Truth literally zero in between with those 3 Champs. One or the other only.
hmadtqr,baburu12,11/27/2021,1,310.0,well it depends which version of the story you believe. according to upsets latest tweet he told the team about a serious situation at home two weeks before worlds. According to adam and bwipo he told them the night before.
hm9f4or,hpl2000,11/27/2021,1,163.0,I’m more concerned that the douchecanoe above me was being so aggressive to shit on someone’s achievement in a video game.
hmab1zi,LegalEmergency,11/27/2021,1,313.0,Thats true  but at the same time his teammates have the right to be annoyed/frustrated about the situation because they got screwed over and never got an explanation why.
hm91528,SikeBo1,11/27/2021,1,196.0,How do you play so much solo queue my brain is dead from stress after one game. Doesnt matter if i stomp win or lose
hmaxyek,1234123517,11/27/2021,1,65.0,aatrox revive and chemtech soul have nothing in similarity other than both do something after death. how aatroxs revive is used and what its used for its much more different than chemtech soul. stupid ass comparison
hma5z8r,greekcel_25,11/27/2021,1,55.0,Because of the quality of pros? Team core has world champion and world finalist.
hmb32fw,BHowe1205,11/27/2021,1,81.0,we literally have tweets from before the backlash saying that only the major story beats are canon and not the actual specifics of any dialogue since that was all up to player choice. the rookie is one of the major story beats that is canon we know this for a fact because rioters have gone on record saying yes the rookie is 100% canon but the dialogue options you choose for him are not. the rookie is a character who helped the sentinels as they traveled runeterra recruited the members and eventually fought viego. no amount of mental gymnastics will change that  &#x200B  its not riots fault that people like you twist or even completely ignore what they say to suit the circlejerk narrative that this sub pushes about what is and isnt canon  &#x200B  reav3 comment stating that the story beats included in the VN are canon but specific interactions between characters arent (the one people reference about riot trying to retcon after the event was received poorly): [https://twitter.com/spideraxe30/status/1419739830045614082?lang=en](https://twitter.com/spideraxe30/status/1419739830045614082?lang=en)  &#x200B  reav3 comment from 10 days before about 1 week after the event started and before the backlash really began stating the same thing - that there is an overall canon narrative of events but that specifics in both the VN and other mediums are not necessarily canon: [https://twitter.com/spideraxe30/status/1416134070086606862?lang=en](https://twitter.com/spideraxe30/status/1416134070086606862?lang=en)  &#x200B  Reav3 even acknowledges that using the term canon caused a lot of misunderstandings but you can clearly tell what he means by everything. its obvious that he never changed his stance he just clarified it but somehow this sub cant look at dates or comprehend that hes saying the same thing just more clearly
hmcvymk,ScumbagMotherfucker,11/27/2021,1,270.0,I’ve played a game today where we lost 4 drakes and enemy got chemtech soul. This game was over 50 minutes long there were 3 elders and 5 or 6 barons. Pure fucking insanity. We won somehow after both teams accumulated over 160 kills total. 4 people dealt over 100k dmg. I feel like I’ve cheated the system by winning against this bullshit fucking drake
hma5utk,YoungAnimater35,11/27/2021,1,7.0,Yeah I get that but Im specifically asking how to deal with being ahead and dealing with a split pusher champ. If I leave lane they take towers when I go help my team  Just looking for different paths I could take

hmahlfm,DifferentHorse,11/27/2021,1,26.0,Lol dont need quotation marks for trash. I know Im trash to the sun and back. Ive played for quite a while on and off mainly blind and bots for fun but got back on recently wanting to actually improve.  Even while playing I kick myself for making stupid calls. For example jungler fighting nearby lane opponent and I went to help but my jungler died. I started to fight my laner though I knew the enemy jg was close by. By the time I processed this in my stupid brain I was dead. WHY DO I MAKE SUCH STUPID DECISIONS.
hmcz1xf,TheMexicanJoker,11/27/2021,1,30.0,BASED
hm9m2x4,Constant-Drawer-5901,11/27/2021,1,1.0,Why didnt he use sett tho
hmd93ob,frosthowler,11/27/2021,1,,You cant really do it without a windup (well you can but you need to practice close-range a lot to get it right if youre doing that may as well also practice angle-Qs ie triangle with R extension) but I pretty much still only exclusively use Q->Q->R.  Q->R->Q makes no sense and is never useful for me.  The nerf wasnt meant to stop you from using Q->Q->R but rather to reduce the range extension Zoe can get through walking before she uses R. You can still walk just **much** less than you used to. Before it used to be really low skill so long as you R at any point before Q2 fizzles the range would be extended.  Now you need to R *before* the Q passes you which means its going to punish you a lot more consistently for missing because of R mana cost which you could forego if you realized you Q2 is going to miss before.
hmc4wxh,IcyPanda123,11/27/2021,1,214.0,The bronze aram only player who put them into the game even said they knew they were gonna be way more powerful then the other ones. In a well balanced and made game though youd want less RNG obviously so all drakes and souls SHOULD be balanced similarly.
hmbvgcm,dhdicjneksjsj,11/27/2021,1,27.0,Riot said custom skins are bannable btw.
hmch3sl,Zudoarie,11/27/2021,1,625.0,Im not a lol player but with that cosplay of Jinx u would get me to have a crush on you 😋

hmch2pr,OuterRaven,11/27/2021,1,108.0,Sorakas ult literally counters his ult though. As soon as you see the X just press R and Pyke will be up shit creek without a paddle.
hm9su04,Zerole00,11/27/2021,1,41.0,A friend once saw CoreJJ in the shower. Said he has an 8 pack. CoreJJ is shredded.
hmb173g,MoonDawg2,11/27/2021,1,,> I dont think Galeforce is trash thats a bit extreme. But theres a lot of hyperbole going on in this post anyway which is usually what happens whenever this sub gets on the subject of ADC balance  I agree honestly. Its just annoying that people on this sub ignore any issues on adc because they remember that one time an adc was 15-4 and did actual damage while the entirety of high elo agrees that the role is horrible.  Honestly this threads are better for venting as an adc main vs actually having a discussion since that is usually impossible with people
hmbm2ri,ARMIsNOTLoaded,11/27/2021,1,,>When you can get a ranked ready 15000 BE account for 4 dollars in less than 20 minutes it becomes super common real quick.  Yeah I didnt buy any account but sometimes I go around boosting sites just out of curiosity to see what the prices are and the account selling store they have is ridiculously cheap. Botted LV30 unranked account for 5€ max around 20k BP undetected since it is all bot games and with also a warranty just in case damn if I wouldnt call it a good deal TBH.

hma3k5n,Cohenbby,11/27/2021,1,3.0,Absolutely not 6 item vlad by a competent player is arguably the strongest thing in the game presuming everyones summs are up.
hmaknny,Pure_Void,11/27/2021,1,13.0,losing 15 out of 20 games is tuff i would recommend either taking a break or playing different game mode like aram in my eyes gets boring quick but i know some ppl only play it and have fun but try playing 5v5 once in a while maybe that will help since its a diff way of how the game is played out
hma9s8j,Coolestdude123,11/27/2021,1,311.0,It wasnt a sudden medical emergency though because it was building for a few weeks. It was just as Adam said. She was lonely/depressed and had huge suffering (as Upset said). Then the day before worlds she starts getting more depressed and rings Upset crying. Then Upset decides he has to go home.  So the reason would seem shitty hence why he never told anyone.
hmbrmn6,JoshQuest1,11/27/2021,1,4.0,Re: The second bug    If you look in the first video youll see theres a yellow ring that appears under the monster falling asleep that is not there on a champion.    The missing effects from the star guardian skin are the reskin of that yellow ring which is a lot more pronounced in star guardian which is why you see it as wholly different.    Also Im taking this moment to say after all these years I still miss qqr. :(
hma3a5k,J3ckD4niels,11/27/2021,1,21.0,![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|scream)
hmd722c,GroundbreakingAlps2,11/27/2021,1,,Being high elo in soloq helps but its kinda the same thing that we saw with Tfblade whenever he streamed scrims/ played twitch rivals vs actual top laners in a controlled environment. He just wasnt able to have the same impact that he did in soloq (even on his one trick/best picks and whenever he got banned out it was simply sad to watch).  You can look through the opggs of general sniper and tfblade back in the day and one thing you will see is that they are playing a lot vs filled top laners or top mains that are just gm maybe even master tier (some maybe even d1). To be the next tfblade or to smurf in soloq you bascailly just need to be really insane at punishing bad players/autofills and completely pubstomping players that are quite a bit worse than you (filled/considerably lower elo).   On the flip side in pro play youre for the most part only playing against good players. Youre playing against players that are on role and players that could probably easily get top 50 soloq whenever they want. I mean you cant even compare playing vs impact fudge alphari ssumday jenkins bwipo huni finn revenge etc vs playing against a top laner thats 150lp (or even worse playing against an autofill). Sure a rank1 player like general sniper could maybe punish a player like that harder than at least a few of the pro players that I just mentioned (obviously also depending on which champions you are playing).   The comparison between pro and soloq is honesty laughable. It requires completely different skillset and thats before I even mention comms and playing together as a team.  Its a completely different game. Being high elo and maybe even rank1 in soloq doesnt necessarily mean that you match up well against other high elo/good playres in your role. It just means that you can stomp bad players and can carry hard and can overcome whatever gaps show up in other lanes due to matchmaking.
hmaz6g4,Ahri_Support_OTP,11/27/2021,1,,I dont think this has anything to do with what Im talking about? I may be wrong though. Im not the handful of people who dodge or AFK incredibly often but this post is about them and Riots response to them. The solution they brought is worse than the problem.

hmbqzni,DHSUAUGEV,11/27/2021,1,326.0,Yasuo doesnt just stick on you when you play against him. Hes usually eing and weaving in autos and abilities. So hes not really stacking it fast and getting as much use.  Yones E he chases you down and autos you 20 times returns back and does extra damage.  He get way more use out of it.  You can literally just look at the statistics. Yone is doing way better than yasuo.

I agree that I dont think TLs top lane is as good as people make it to be.  &#x200B  I would say C9s Summit and Berserker sounds a lot scarier. Hopefully Fudge can develop into a monster but I think its funny how people just suddenly think DL Bjerg Jensen and Svenskeren are washed. People go through 1 bad season and its career ending. There are so many world champions who have had redemption arcs like Crown DoinB Faker Meiko.  &#x200B  Like people are just sleeping on talent and only care about salary this salary that. Its like no one cares about talent anymore even if people say they do but fall into money fallacy how theyre all for talent but then throw in costs.

hmbuuqj,Blue-moon-wolf,11/27/2021,1,221.0,How it SHOULD be is any champ can be the main character of their own story and you as the player have the option of following said story and putting upon them the protagonist role by following said story. how it plays out though is that the most popular money making champs end up as the stars of the series and anything else may as well be an NCP who we get to play as for some reason.  But if we were to pick an Iron Man of League as the one who leads the charge for the big events then Ryze would likely fit that spot. Even in the original trailer Ryze was practically front and center. Even then its a bit iffy considering the Ruination happened and Ryze had no part of it.

This kind of clip has been seen by the whole western world that spoke english and played the game at the time.  BTW the majority being pisslow is just a fact. Even in Riot Games the majority is bronze  Btw even your comment doesnt make sense. Its not just a reference its also a fact. Jungle and support are the easiest roles by far even though like all 5 roles skillcap is very high the skill required to do jungle and supp roles at a decent level is outrageously low

hma4iq5,anghellous,11/27/2021,1,12.0,Penetration everywhere AND they reduced resistance values outright with item rework. They tried adding various other passive resistances on the tank items which is cool is some places but terrible in others.

hmaf3x6,musashihokusai,11/27/2021,1,,Doinb is a social butterfly. His definition of “won’t talk at all” might just be him saying “he’s an introvert”.   Moving to a new country where you don’t speak the language is difficult for anyone. I’ve done it several times and it made it very hard for me deal with people (even when they were being very nice). I don’t have “social/personality problem”. This is why imports usually don’t work. The ones that succeed and integrate well are exceptional people.   Some players don’t communicate much and just follow through on shotcalls. Different players communicate differently. Sometimes you need players like that if you have strong voices on the team.

hm97c48,Xonra,11/27/2021,1,170.0,Then he shouldnt have the right to be mad they are making assumptions or pissed off at him. All signs are more so pointing to him bullshitting as there is plenty of reason to believe he left for his significant other and zero (aside from his fake outrage) his leaving was actually family related.   He has been proven to have lied yet people are still just blindly defending him. Alphari unintentionally disputed his claim that Alphari approached him when it was the other way around. 3 different teammates at 3 different times have disputed his claim of mentioning anything but his significant other and problems with them (literally the day before he left) for reasons he might of left as he apparently said nothing else.
hmaqb1g,MoonDawg2,11/27/2021,1,139.0,Because put it on a role where most of its relevant damage comes from the raw AD of autos instead of abilities and has horrible scaling with levels. also dont forget being overshot in damage most of the time so the shield isnt as relevant as youd think and the lifesteal mostly sucks if you dont have big burst go brr ability which doesnt happen till your 3rd item unless again youre a bruiser who can just spam their shit for free (irelia yasuo yone best examples). The item just fucking sucks on every adc minus on-hits  Theres a reason theres more none adc shieldbow users than in the actual role.

hmaf25g,w1ldcraft,11/27/2021,1,,As someone that watches LPL primarily Id have to agree with him too. 369 is someone that has a coinflip game most of the time. When he rolls a 9 he rolls over the enemy team & shows 0 mercy. But when he rolls a 3 it looks Swords cosplay from the game v iG.  You give him resources he wins you titles. You put him on weakside its going to be a mess.

And while Kennen isn’t as powerful he could definitely be a strong ally to Ryze (especially if his lore ultimate is as strong as his in-game one XD).
hm9wbt3,hiccup333,11/27/2021,1,12366.0,This is why I was ultimately pretty disappointed in the show.  They deliberately dont let Vi  say any of this stuff so they can keep Jinx the villain.  I get that they have to but then its a failure in story execution.  They couldnt have the story end that way without hurting Vis character making her effort and desire to get Jinx back seem unconvincing imo.
hma2e28,TheFlattestStanley,11/27/2021,1,,The idea that ffing games is optimal so you can get another one to climb more is a misconception.  And like if whether or not you are enjoying the game is entirely based off of whether or not you are wasting time (losing) then this probably isnt the best game for you.  >If you had limited time to play too you wouldnt want to be stuck in a game with somebody flaming and wasting your time.   >Sometimes that 10 minutes is the difference between getting another game in and not being able too.  Ok and what if you were to lose that game as well? Desperately playing games in the hope that youll win one and start feeling better is not a good strategy for life.  You arent even losing out on any potential games that youve planned for. Lets say youve managed to set aside a hour and a half to play league (arbitrary amount of time just for an example). You can fit 2 games in that. If ffing one of those games lets you fit in a third and your team doesnt ff youre still playing 2 games which is what you expected to play that day if that makes sense.
hmbvefg,Xonra,11/27/2021,1,221.0,They are like the big daddy magics of the world. It would be like Hextech is the equivalent of a battleship cannon while a World Rune is no less than a nuke if you were to compare them in strength.  Hextech is mostly a facilitator for extraordinary things in the context of the Runeterra world like high-tech. A World Rune is a level of insane magic that could make some rando off the street one of the most powerful and most dangerous mages outside of say Ryze or Brand of course. They are crazy crazy magic.

Like others have suggested I highly suggest muting everyone in the settings. Its what I told a friend to do when they started playing. Yea it sucks because youll miss that diamond in the rough whos a genuine good person but its not worth wading through the sewage thats the rest of the community.

hm936mu,KnockoutRoundabout,11/27/2021,1,7741.0,I actually hardcore disagree.  Powders meltdown was the most realistic portrayal of an ACTUAL childs meltdown Ive ever seen in media. Its not pretty little tears and soft sobs its snot and spit and screaming throwing shit and (because of the circumstances of her situation and her mentality) hitting herself as a self-punishment. Children lack the emotional regulation and control of adults and Powder specifically is in a VERY rough living situation and has been dealing with some hardcore self-esteem issues that have been building and building for likely a very long time.  Vi is/was her rock in the ocean of her tumultuous feelings so when Vi turned around and told Powder she WASNT ready it confirmed all of Powders worst fears. Sure we as viewers and adults know that Vi was just doing the right thing to keep her little sister safe. But Powder? Powder just heard the person she looks up to the most who she knows is always there for her call her weak and useless. A burden.  Powder is a powder keg (heh) of emotional trauma and her meltdown scene was the culmination of that.
hmamu08,NailPrestigious3080,11/27/2021,1,184.0,Congrats bro! I was also wishing that I could get into platinum but my goal is to reach diamond.  I barely stop playing League of Legends because I have no Personal computer or a Laptop to playI play LOL only on computer shops back in the day. when the Covid became worst thats  the time where I cannot go to the computer shops because of the fricking virus and my whole league of legends career somehow ended.   Im also stuck in Gold 2 but I managed to climb gold 1 and that is the only rank I managed to climb   But I badly want to play league of legends again. :)

hmchc9g,DoggyP0O,11/27/2021,1,203.0,Reread your own post. My interpretation is completely valid.   But even still Fnatic made the situation very clear from the start to their players. They have learned literally nothing more about the situation with the recent drama as they shouldnt because thats obviously a huge violation of privacy.

hmacut9,OilOfOlaz,11/27/2021,1,311.0,First and foremost I would respect my wifes wish not to tell it anyone if she said so and that might have been the case here as well (wich is obviously speculation).  > Well Fnatics LoL team isnt a group of 5 accountants who see each other in the office and they werent in Reykjavík for recreational activities and team bonding either.  I work as an event manager before I started working freelance I saw my closest collegues on average more often then my wife weeks 60-90 woring hours werent that unusual and we essentially went out and drink basically every night in the first few years cuz it was often for free and you had a bunch of ppl that had a ton of build up stress they wanted to drown.  I wasnt a pro player on FNC but pretty close to many ppl I worked together with.   > Seriously? Guys my wife was just taken to the hospital I gotta take the next flight home. You wouldnt share that with people at work? People you work with 6 or 7 days a week? 12 hours a day? The people who are about to get shit on at the thing everyone worked for a year cause you gotta leave?  yeah seriously my wife is a doctor you actually cant imagine how many ppl hide severe illnesses even from their partners and children if someone has cancer.   If she doesnt want anyone to know that shes severly ill you wont go on record and tell my team that consists of ppl that Ive been working together with for most of the past decade just because shit like this makes the rounds in my job pretty quickly and ppl start asking stuff about it. Now imagine that with 5 public figures on your team who regularly interact with other ppl in the scen and fans and someone might spill the beans for sure I mean it actually happend every time sth happend behind the scenes in lol.  > Again say your wife has a medical emergency and that shes in the hospital. Why are you so hellbent on hiding that from your colleagues. Its the 21st century. People are pretty receptive to illness and the act of seeking medical treatment.  Because ppl will the approach my wife and ask her about the medical emergency she is not willing to let other ppl know about.
hma5834,Zerole00,11/27/2021,1,147.0,Whats hilarious here is DL is parroting the same stupid shit redditors have been:  >Youre gonna have to tell them why...Even if you give them a very vague answer...  He literally did so with urgent family matter which Adam even said in his TL - that just wasnt sufficient for Adam (or the redditors itching for drama). There are some subjects where theres really not much room for being vague (my personal guess is that his wife had a miscarriage).  A lot of people here also seem to miss the nuance that both sides can be correct in feeling the way they do. If my coworker had to bail on a big project because of a death in the family thats perfectly understandable but I can still be pissed because the delay cost me a $20k bonus and I had done nothing wrong other than being at the wrong place at the wrong time.

I could give 0 shits about how Yone and Yas are doing because I can simply fuck them over with one ability the problem rn tho is that LT makes the cooldown for Q so small that they can beat anyone in a 1v1 duel at any stage as long as they are not behind.  This is hilarious to me because what you just described is available to Fiora at every stage of the game simply by the virtue of her kit. Yas/Yone need to at least select the proper rune setup that enables their early game. Man its funny getting some backstory on the idiots complaining about this. How about you dodge some of the Qs?

hmaibcg,Glum_Radio,11/27/2021,1,79.0,Before i can talk about my opinion you can watch EDG version here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K\_uFU2L9Ano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_uFU2L9Ano)  Vipers case:  First You cant compare the case of Viper and Nuguri together just  because theyre Korean. Yes theyre Korean but they have different role. Viper is  an AD and  he have Meiko assists him ALL THE TIME especially EDG like to play through bot. Meiko is super friendly and like to talk ALOT talking here doesnt mean hello or hwating or winning losing but talk about everything until you open your mouth and talk to him thats Vipers first benefit in EDG. Plus Meiko already has experience with Deft.  Second Viper has Scout as roommate and translator. Although each team has their own translator and Manager but thats only for learning language in normal life player rather like to ask or communicate with their teammate because theyre the same age. Scout also a talkative friendly person like Meiko and willing to help Viper anytime.  Third Viper is extrovert person so he can quickly adapt to the new environment Flander Jeje Coach EDGs staff are all willing to communicate or even joke  with Viper again communicate here doesnt mean hello or hwating or about winning losing but talk about everything outside the game like how are you feeling right now whats your opinon?..ect. They make you comfortable enough to be able to share about your own opinion Viper even pointed out Flanders bad habit of dying too much because it makes Viper feel super insecure. Flander accepted that and didnt feel offensive at all.  Finally EDG isnt an easy-going team yes theyre talkative they like to joke (include Coach and staff) they will  scold you super harsh if youre lost but theyre still want to communicate with you and ASK ABOUT YOUR OWN FEELING rather than telling you to do this or that and ignore your feeling/opinion. Viper is lucky to join EDG and EDG is  also lucky to have Viper. This is a win win situation Viper is clearly put a lot of effort but EDG also put a lot of effort to understand their player.  In Nuguris case:  He is an introvert and has poor health from the start. He is a top laner unlike adc has their support a top laner usually play alone or require Jungle to have them but in this case Tian/Bo really cant help Nuguri at all because Doinb also require Jungle help heavily.  I can clearly see this is an awkward situation for Nuguri to feel. FPX player seem quiet beside DoinB Tian said he was trying to communicate with Nuguri but its just try to say hello or hwaiting it is nonsense conversation.  Lwx and Crisp didnt communicate much with Nuguri Tian is also a quiet person (this kid look super unhealthy lol) the only person can communicate with Nuguri is Doinb and i dont see it at all DoinB alway talk about the game and winning thats all the coach the staff i dont see any of them talking to Nuguri much so maybe this is the reason he feel so disconnect with the team i mean he look so sad and lonely.  You can see at 01:02:36 after FPX taking the group photo Nuguri just look so lost and look around because he didnt know what to do or go next and no one come to guide him. I dont defense for Nuguri here because i also think Nuguri didnt put much effort to integrate with the team but the problem here is FPX staff and player also didnt put effort to integrate with Nuguri.  Overall if you want to compare between Nuguri and Viper you better see EDG documentary first to understand the situation.

hmathvx,Glum_Radio,11/27/2021,1,112.0,You better watch EDG documentary and understand what i mean.  Communicate after the match talk about each other feeling talking to each other take care of each other i dont see anything that make me feel like they’re trying to help Nuguri with their best effort. They’re noisy but not communicate much with Nuguri? Communicate here is talk about everything until he talk to you not just say one or two word and then give up because he’s ignore you lol. “ Nuguri would also talk about the members sometimes on stream” => it’s nonsense he and they should talk WITH each other it should be direct conversation. FPX maybe has tried but not their best try. I see they try like 2 or 3 times and then just give up it’s a fault of both side but the organization should put much more effort to make it work because you’re the one losing money here blaming just make it get worse. In Viper case you can see he has extrovert personality but EDG still doesn’t ignore him and alway try to communicate with him all the time if he doesn’t want to talk they still talk to him.
hmd4kxi,markson852,11/27/2021,1,218.0,Id say recruiting someone who doesnt fit the role(againit is a known fact that he doesnt communicate with his team way before he joined FPX) in hope that he will change because you paid well is much more naive.

hmai781,Rexsaur,11/27/2021,1,23.0,I think it just highlights the problem of a permanent soul in general.  Souls in general should have a cooldown on death (like atleast 120/180s).

If you not happy with him then confront him behind the scene to air it out like that that tell me that his teammates is pretty childish.

hmb28d9,TheRealPiggynator,11/27/2021,1,38.0,Sorc boots are unironically a good buy since your spike dmge is so small that +18 pen does a lot for your dmge. People who downvote you dont realize that rammus W gives so much resistances that building a lot more of it is just wastig stats the diffirence between 300 and 600 armor is non existent and a waste.  TheBausffs usually builds thornmail into sorc boots and riftmaker on Rammus and riftmaker is also a strong buy because your spike dmge now does part true dmge rammus  has good ap scaling and all your spike dmge is single target and gives you a ton of sustain with the omnivamp if people are hitting you. Same reason why void staff is good.

The cell shaded mix of 2d and 3d animation by Frotiche is indeed high quality but I wouldnt give it the GOAT status it has been done before.

hmcin55,-Quit,11/27/2021,1,65.0,> Damage is SUPPOSED to be higher than defense late game  What do you mean late game? Most champs who can buy pen items like serylda ldr or void buy these them as a second or 3rd item. These items are seriously OP and they end bought even when there are no tanks in the game just because a champ dares to have MR or armor.

hmb7xmc,Temeritas,11/27/2021,1,452.0,That is way too generalized and technically not correct. A VPN works by tunneling your traffic up to an exit point towards your destination. However the route the tunneled traffic takes can be very different than the route used for the normal traffic. That means it might need more or fewer hops thus it can have a higher or lower ping.   It is very unlikely that you will get a lower ping with a free VPN as those doubtfully have optimized routing or enough computational power for speedy decryption/encryption of your traffic at their endpoint. But depending on how bad your routing is a paid for VPN might very well provide you with a lower ping.
hmawj9l,TrueMinoshiro,11/27/2021,1,5.0,a) is a strawman  b) is half-assumption  I agree that team gold stat is useful but knowing how fragile the playerbase is Id be reluctant to give my team access to such information. Still a good feature.  The best gold stat is the **current value of items** each team equips. It gives a somewhat accurate representation of the average strength.

hmajyao,JesiAsh,11/27/2021,1,12.0,How? They are alive resurrected or undead. There is no dead-dead champion in this game since Gankplank returned. Meaning that killing him was just a VGU event.

hm9bliq,Ok-Satisfaction945,11/27/2021,1,1.0,Normal games will always be like this. What I found helps win games with teammates “that lack knowledge ig” cross ganks/ early kill jungler camps/ you gotta be point guard. I play top mostly but gank all lanes as soon as I win mines/ get drags/ ward here and there just all around player
hma77k7,fuckin_in_the_bushes,11/27/2021,1,145.0,This doesnt make any sense. He had to go back home to be with his family. Doesnt mean he cant unwind  when he is home playing some fucking videogames.  WTF.
hmaaave,Mashdex,11/27/2021,1,18.0,Pyke support is a role in itself
hmao37d,MoonDawg2,11/27/2021,1,140.0,Kraken is good galeforce is pretty shit since it gets hard outscaled (unless youre burst oriented aka jhin and maybe lucian though he sucks) wits end is extremely situational being only used on on-hit builds  and shieldbow is shit unless youre vayne ashe or kog.  LDR is shit because of the build path and that it just doesnt do enough damage most of the time. Check the stats on when its build second or third its horrid.  The role has pretty shit itemisation atm and the issue is crit and other roles just getting straight up more impactful items.

hma6l4y,hiccup333,11/27/2021,1,12388.0,Totally agree.  It thats the way the story had to go it just wasnt executed well.  The scene had to play out in a really contrived way that made Vis effort to save her seem totally inadequate and Jinxs choices unearned

hmcu3v2,Gulrakrurs,11/27/2021,1,31.0,I agree. I did tribunal back in season 1 have Judgment Kayle from it. It seems like a good community solution to the problem once again. Just make sure summoner names in cases are all anonymous so we dont get witch hunts.
hmapg61,REPORT_JUNGLE,11/27/2021,1,49.0,when i first started people recommended warwick to me because he is easy but after just one game i got bored of him. so dont go for easy champs they get boring fast (like garen) ! better go for fun champ and since you like toplane tanky bruisers i would go for sett !

hma0p5o,SadPeggy,11/27/2021,1,2.0,a) People can ff because they used the wrong emote if they want to having a read on statistics is not giving them a reason to ff.   b) In other MOBAs the team gold statistic is available yet the ff ratio is probably the same.
hmawu9m,stuffslols,11/27/2021,1,27.0,Piecd by piece. And lots of practice. First I reccomened looking up an item build guide online and following that every game but making sure you read the item and its stats/passive so you can see what it does and how to work with it. Once your comfortable  then your try looking through the store for an item. You think would be good and try it out see how it feels and works for ya. Wash rinse repeat.  Thankfully it gets easier over time. For most items you just need to know the passive and general role (ex: sunfire aegis is a tank item that hurts when you stand near them) so you know how the enemy will play and can work around their surprises.  Honestly Champs are much more difficult to learn than items if your practicing imo
hmckmy9,1maru,11/27/2021,1,440.0,He’s probably more likeable than he thinks

hmd62fj,SpaghettiIssoup,11/27/2021,1,12.0,Regardless of intention afking games ruins the game for those still in it. Leaving games for any reason is punishable as it should be.
hm9zpv7,quiteUnskilled,11/27/2021,1,133.0,2015 Fnatic was also great as was Origen but more due to the fact that the west did not even feel close to the east in 2013 and 2014 and 2015 Fnatic/Origen changed that. But I wouldnt think of them as actual title contenders that year more like dark horses the rest was mostly hype due to the expectations having been so low from the years before imo.
hmbam4v,Twispie,11/27/2021,1,549.0,Found the Lee Sin player
hmaocwg,NonnagLava,11/27/2021,1,70.0,Because Im pretty sure a number of these are AId versions of actual League art. Like the AI searched Noxus and found Swains base splash art and God-King Darius and tried to make a picture based on those (and others) for Noxus.  Same Im pretty sure Freljords art is based on one of the Ornn stories cover art as is Shurimas. They all look like art Im fairly confident Riot has used at some point or another just not actually a picture of the art just something *based* on that art.
hm97jjl,BarkFrungusPhD,11/27/2021,1,19.0,Look up Sinerias on youtube. Hes a consistantly challenger master yi player in EU. He currently has a good jg clear video on youtube. You can also find a link to his discord there which is very helpful for aspiring yi mains.
hm93g00,BBQMasterDad,11/27/2021,1,26.0,You realize it scales based on how far behind the team is capping at 1k right? And it’s 500 as I said for a MAJOR objective. That’s literally a shit ton of gold per player lmfao. That’s not even accounting for the actual gold the objective itself gives. You can argue this all you want but numbers don’t lie here League is a numbers game in addition to skill.
hmc3xw4,attila954,11/27/2021,1,285.0,They threw out lore that hasnt been updated in a while Ryze had a full update in 2019  Also in his cinematic you can see that Ryze runs around as himself not his d&d character  While the characters magic is an allusion to Ryze the mage himself is not Ryze just someone who learned the same spells he did
hmaetao,Tski3,11/27/2021,1,79.0,I think hes saying when they were on the same page as a team ot was short lived and they spent more time dysfunctional as to how to play the game.

hmau2r5,boostedben1,11/27/2021,1,112.0,Nuguri is the only Korean that hadnt ever fully integrated socially with the four members of FPX. Gimgoon and Khan both integrated socially into FPX. When Gimgoon first joined FPX his Chinese wasnt that great. Out of three Korean tops Nuguri is the only one that hasnt been able to connect with them. Im not trying to blame Nuguri but I think that history has shown that FPX and its members which has stayed the same for three years do try really hard to become good team mates and friends with a foreign player. Honestly this might just have to be  due to personality differences as Nuguri is introverted. But it is not right to say that they only try 2 or 3 times when history says differently

hm94xsz,SocialistScissors,11/27/2021,1,28.0,The 2 he didnt give it to were both of the support players aswell. I wonder if he holds the role to a higher standard considering just how good he is at it.
hmbquo3,Baxland,11/27/2021,1,70.0,And then Objective Bounties pop up for enemy team due to all this inflated gold generated by Pykes Ultimate and if you ever happen to lose a teamfight you just made yourself lategame Corki and Ekko.

hma8orz,EROTIC_RAID_BOSS,11/27/2021,1,48.0,garen is the beginner bruiser character for sure.  but you have moba experience anyway. if you want to try top lane check out renekton pantheon illaoi sett darius mordekaiser. more advanced characters you might like are like camille or aatrox.  you can also play a lot of jungler bruisers like vi warwick diana xin zhao jarvan 4 or again more advanced ones like lee sin or viego  Id say look up some gameplay vids of each and see who interests you. I personally love aatrox and illaoi and illaoi should be one of the champs they offer for free like your second day. theyre kinda immobile but high damage and durability and rely a lot on abilities  &#x200B  warwick and vi are pretty beginner friendly junglers

hmbq2z9,montlogan,11/27/2021,1,70.0,This isn’t surprising. Pyke and all other ability reset champion have their cool downs occur after the initial cast. It’s technically on “cool down” even if you can cast it because it’s a recast. Even spells such as Camille Q interact this way because if they didn’t you’d be punished for holding onto them.
hma9l0h,FluckyVer,11/27/2021,1,83.0,Tristana can abuse it quite a bit.  Besides you Literally listed 70% of the Adcs that want to build AS. Since not all do.  So its pretty decent

hm96zga,will408914,11/27/2021,1,5.0,I uh. I think this is what Jhin’s victims are supposed to look like after he’s through with them canonically.

hm9k3oe,pepperpete,11/27/2021,1,54.0,I agree the only reason I wouldnt straight up say hes the best top in the World is because we havent seen him go up against other top laners outside the LPL this past year but if I was forming a team with no import restrictions hed definitely be my choice for the role. Along with Canyon in the jungle I think those would be my only clear choices every other role would have 2 or 3 potential players.  EDIT: Nevermind with Uzi coming back I would pick him over any other ADC regardless of form dude is my favourite player ever.

hmae1dk,shineyumbreon,11/27/2021,1,204.0,Being hardstuck in low bronze with thousands of hours more likely than not does though. Either way there is a big mental blockade preventing him of improving. Things like that are also classified as a mental disability/condition. Afaik most abnormal things regarding mental health (anxiety stress depression anger issues etc.) are at least to some extent considered as mental disability/condition. Nothing offensive or wrong about that though.
hm8vmvr,ArchMageMagnus,11/27/2021,1,37.0,It honestly doesnt feel this way. Mid to late game hes running around 3 shotting towers and when you go to that tower to defend hes already ran to another one. If he catches any champ out he stun locks you and youre dead after 3-4 hits.
hmc2lp3,90CaliberNet,11/27/2021,1,12.0,I feel like people like you shouldnt play the game because you ruin it for other people. I get riot fucks up a lot and they dont always drop the best content but also sometimes they do drop the best content. BUT the amount of shit they give for free through chests and keys and how much shit you get from a battlepass or from events its absurd compared to other games and its disgusting seeing comments like this shit on the people from riot who make these good decisions. I get you dont like riot but to say theyre money hungry and arent fun because they run a business blows my mind especially when you compare them to any other AAA company that does it FAR FAR FAR worse than them.

hma41ps,csudoku,11/27/2021,1,13.0,Its more of the thing if you want to play the game because you like arcane you shouldnt play. You should play the game because you are genuinely interested in playing the game because it is NOTHING like the show. There is no story and all the outlets from learning about the characters are honestly found outside of the game itself.
hm9efin,MrKatsudon,11/27/2021,1,49.0,any idea why TES is replacing Karsa? I think TES issue last year is Top and support.
hmcr7qn,Aidonius,11/27/2021,1,,it looked amazing at the time. like it was such a difference from the original map. Remember that this was not that long after the game left beta as well.   We can look back and sure it looks like ass now but when it came out it was pretty special

hm9ar2l,Pheraprengo,11/27/2021,1,359.0,EU as a whole is signicantly more toxic thsn lther regions.  EUNE is more toxic than EUW I can support that with my own experience.

hmc0qg2,delahunt,11/27/2021,1,1529.0,Yeah. If they couldve got Vander free in time. Since I think the explosion is also what freed him in a sense.  Definitely a rough situation all around.
hmc65oy,Purplewizzlefrisby,11/27/2021,1,,This would be a really cool skinline. Call it apocalypse or something and its champions at the end of the world or something. Have Kindreds be a legendary and they basically talk about how quiet it is and wolf is finally satisfied or whatever. Lots of gold/grey/white effects and eerie sounds.

And this guy makes a simple post and you reply to it?  At this point it seems like azir is being ignored on purpose just to piss of the players.
hmc2tok,Kotnarok,11/27/2021,1,214.0,sion doesnt have a cooldown on passive but there are no complaint threads about him.     yall just being whiny and need time to adjust it takes a minimum of 20 mins to get this with the enemy team not contesting or failing to contest smite 4 times.  at that point you deserve the punishment / their reward of a soul is justified

hmcggha,Chefmaks,11/27/2021,1,235.0,If it would only work as intended anyway.  I have seen so many instances of champions randomly not being revived by the chemtech soul by now its not even funny lol. But yes I agree a cooldown would be a great addition!
hmajiiv,CarMain5540,11/27/2021,1,1.0,Bro who gives a fuck honestly
hmalkso,Dawegar,11/27/2021,1,,Blitz is the perfect example. You start playing you think the hook is always up then you realise if they miss he is a walking target for over 10 seconds. Then you learn the hand the hook comes from and it blows your mind.  (This never worked with Thresh for me I can’t do what a good thresh can do so still think he is unbeatable lol lucky I play top)
hmb2foe,Nyte_Crawler,11/27/2021,1,101.0,Wait are you dissing ABO? He was a top 3 mid last split based off stats. Granted there were a lot of rosters imploding last split but to his credit he was playing on a bottom tier team.  Oh fun fact about him having good stats- he also had the lowest gold share after 15 among all mids. (IE he doesnt hog farm after laning)
hm97qnv,divonemanam,11/27/2021,1,26.0,if you want Id love to help. I dont take the game seriously but Ive played for long enough  my riot id is: swoopez#EUW also my discord is: swoopez#0001

hmc6gnz,BreakfastCareful9205,11/27/2021,1,,I was wondering if that was the case. If that is the case I guess I dont see what the point of it is then? Should I always use it knowing that the enemy can see me anyway?  &#x200B  Also do you know if it will disable a ward if Im not in vision? I.E. when I gank bot can I just stand at the edge for .5s or so then jump?

hmdalpt,LARXXX,11/27/2021,1,59.0,LNG lost because they did not fix the main problem that they faced the entire summer split. They always choked huge leads in the late game they could not communicate well enough and did not know how to close big games.
hmbguju,ProfessorActual1633,11/27/2021,1,174.0,I think FPX management failed here.  It was obvious Nuguri was gonna be different from Gimgoon Khan or Doinb.  I think all those guys spoke fluent mandarin before going to FPX.  A Korean coach with LPL experience would have worked much better than Steak.    I know the documentary cuts out a lot of stuff but youre telling me theres no footage of the coach doing any strategy sessions or even having an opinion on the whole thing other than telling the players to work harder?  You dont think these guys work hard enough?  If that was the case you should have told the players before the match.  That Krystal person didnt seem to know anything about the game just taking care of LWX.    They should have hired a live in translator to work with Nuguri and the rest of the team.  If Im spending 2.8 million on someone you better believe Im supporting him the best I can.  FPX vs EDG just seemed a difference in professionalism.  All their players are breaking down (Tian Crisp Nuguri Doinb) and theres no evidence they did anything about it.  These guys are investments you need to take care of them not grind them into dust.

hmazzr9,CoogiMonster,11/27/2021,1,,This is actually a bad take… Sion loses any additional range and ability with his zombie state and becomes a glorified tibbers.  An ADC or assassin (that is still over killing enemies effectively making the damage drop off minor) is still insane.  I’ve had chemtech over hextech soul in 8 of my 10 games this preseason and it’s had some kind of dumb outcomes to games with people just ignoring fights and Sion inting/ending as their zombie up to me getting a Quadra kill with 2 kills coming in zombie state.  This soul is by far stronger than any other soul and it’s not close but that’s why it’s preseason.  If it shipped live like this then every chemtech game will undoubtedly be decided by who gets soul and that’s it.
hmb1qts,ChemicalExperiment,11/27/2021,1,769.0,I really hope they tell Warwicks story from his perspective lost memories and all. Make it the thoughline of the season with him getting flashbacks as he attacks Vi and Jinx. Make the big reveal that Vander is Warwick come from his own realization so that along with the surprise we get the trauma of him realizing what hes become. Throughout the season hed be a main antagonist against Jinx and Vi and by the end hed have to grapple with all the terrible things hes done to them as this monster without realizing who they were to him.

hmc8rx9,TheNedsHead,11/27/2021,1,346.0,Id be surprised if they portray Swain as a full on villain. Definitely antagonist vibes tho
hma5kwn,shojmaarensum,11/27/2021,1,147.0,Yeah there is indeed a reason why Upset is still on the team while the others left the team

hm9vhug,paradiselater,11/27/2021,1,269.0,Congrats not just in game but juggling everything youre doing. Hope next run works out.  I am curious about your jungling experience. Any particular reason you settled on kayn as your pick? Im basically a rammus one trick pony but his lack of ability to secure objectives and fight on his own is frustrating so Im looking around to learn something different.  Interestingly Kayn matchup as rammus is hard so I recognize he can be strong. However his stats put Kayn in the middle of the pack for junglers. What are some things you think would be important to master on him? Red or blue or do you stick to the red if 3 melee blue if 3 ranged?  Thanks

Ive seen many great and realistic Jinx cosplays over the years shes a popular character to cosplay and I feel like a remember some more realistic than this. But I dont wanna be bringing anyone down point out flaws or talk shit in any way especially because theres a chance the cosplayer herself reads this. Why not just call it an amazing cosplay why you gotta set yourself or her rather up for dispute like this?  Im probably over thinking it.  Wait... is realistic even an appropriate term for cosplaying an *animated* character? Maybe accurate?

hmawf7m,Not_A_KPOP_FAN,11/27/2021,1,8.0,Basically all of Ionian champs some noxian champs due to the friendly fire thing Demacian champs too since theyll assume him as a weapon supplier for noxus.  Piltover for obvious reasons.   That leaves the yordles void bilgewater shurima and fjord champs as the only neutral characters towards him as far as arcane lore is concerned.

hm9hpmd,GunnerPup13,11/27/2021,1,32.0,I have been getting into the battlefield a lot more recently. Especially with the amount of stupidity that call of duty has been running through the mail more recently. And I honestly enjoy battlefield a lot more than I thought I would. I’ve been playing call of duty since the very first one came out in 2003 so I guess it pains me a little more to see one call of duty fucks up because I’ve been an avid fan for so long. It’s kind of like watching league of legends for you. And you could say that I just need to wait for the bugs to get out of the new call of duty but the point is that I’m paying over $100 for this game because I love the series. I love the IP. The problem is that I’m watching a series that I fell in love with go into the shitter because people want to take it in so many directions. Nobody wants to have the balls to do anything new or exciting. It’s just the same stupidity over and over and over. And I guess you could call it more of being burnt out by the series but it just makes me so frustrated. I’m probably gonna take a break from call of duty for a little while depending on how the next game goes. If the next one is a lot more of the same stupidity I’m just gonna stop playing. And what kills me more than anything it’s people who play the games for even half of the amount of time that I have agree with me that call of duty has gone downhill but you have all these new players who are saying that the game is great. A lot of them are only looking at the game for the same reasons that I looked at it in the beginning. Without having any of the context. And I really wish that they would remaster world at war or one of those older games again. Mostly to show people how awesome the original call of duties that we grew up on were back in the day.

Nowdays people dont escape just that when someone is good there is a chance for showing it on EUW.
hm9y9ty,piotrj3,11/27/2021,1,,So that is why Yasuo/Yone had emergency buffs with new ADC items and that is why Sivir/Varus/Caitlyn goes lethality and this is why GP was useless entire season until they made  a change to improve his crit builds. Ah and this is why Ziggs had to be nerfed because he dominated botlane too much. Aha crit items are OP.  Seriously think about past seasons eg. does anyone remember season 3 as ADC season - no it was mage/assasin season. Would ADC main love to return to those items from S3 absolutly. Would assasin/bruiser main/mage main wanted to return to them - fuck no.

The game may look better but the biggest answer we had to 200 base damage abilities was rune pages and we lost all of that in order to get extremely damage focused masteries.  On top of adding Jinx Yasuo Sett Kled and buffing up Garen and Darius to out-stat to the extreme (Although To clarify Yasuo doesnt outstat the game like the others just mages which are his primary matchup and thanks to his perma shield he cant be poked out by them but he out-stats them in all in fights making their lane hopeless.)

hmaiz2d,AlcinousX,11/27/2021,1,13.0,I disagree. I dont think we need more mana. Theres enough options out there where you can choose to go into it or not. If your champion needs mana theres one out there that should suit your needs. If youre still having mana issues its probably more due to user error than lack of mana options. The true heavy mana users even opt for multiple of these. Champions having infinite mana was something intentionally addressed in previous seasons. If theres a bajillion items with mana everyone will have it and youll never have to worry about resource use which was the reason why they addressed it previously.

hm9zxzl,A_Forgotten_God,11/27/2021,1,2.0,They increased the jungles ult cooldown at first to help stabilize the laning phase a bit. The last iteration saw too much instability with the jungles ganking at level 3/4 while the laners were levels 2/3. Extending the ult cooldown for jungles only deters their early early ganks and gives laners a chance.

hmahhf7,NeekoBestTomato,11/27/2021,1,376.0,You seem to be highly unclear on what actually happened. Let me educate you:  1) Emergency occurs Upset goes home. This is fine. NOBODY has an isssue with this stop asserting this strawman.  2) Emergency is resolved. Meanwhile as a consequence of Upset leaving Fnc the org and 4 players have a years worth of time and effort wasted forever.  3) Nearly a month has passed. There is no emergency what is done is done. Communication can happen before this but if it hasnt now is a good time. Its what a decent normal human being would do. Because a decent normal human being would understand that yes something bad did happen Upset did ALSO fuck over a lot of people - and he at LEAST should talk it over with those people he giga fucked to make sure everyone has no bad blood.  4) Upset doesnt do this and actualy backstabs the people he fucked over. Oh and they arent allowed to be angry because upset is still playign victim for him being a dick. All of which shows that he has NO respect whatsoever for anybody not called Hyli and Yamato. Look whos not on the team anymore btw.  Do you get the point now?  Yes in the moment - you are emotional. Fair enough.  But a LOT of time has passed.   If you are still emotional - get the FUCK off the team and take an extended break. If you arent stop being a dick.

hmagvwp,9percentmilk,11/27/2021,1,26.0,I keep chat on because it’s fun to interact with the other humans playing the game and extreme toxicity is way less prevalent than reddit likes to say it is. But it’s definitely not “useful” and if you’re trying to grind you should probably just turn it off. Learn things about the game from smart people on Youtube not from the scrubs in your game that are just as bad as you.

hmcg53b,PlasticForkRubberDuc,11/27/2021,1,422.0,> Were still the worst class with the worst representation in challenger  This is a pretty irrelevant metric given that you have to play solo in challenger whereas 99.99% of players can play duo which *seriously* increases the power of adcs. So if that is the statistic you cherrypicked to prove your point then I would suggest you reconsider your stance.  As for your other points I really dont have the energy to put together an argument its 2 oclock in the morning here. A very brief TLDR would be:  *  Strong mythics each champ viable with at least 2 very strong options for dps survivability mobilty  * Second item is flexible between early power (collector) scaling (LDR) and champ/game specific options (runaans rfc wits end ER PD)  * Third is tied to IE 90% of the time but some champs can definitely use rageblade well instead. Rageblade also opens up bork as a good item into some teamcomps.  * To finish you pick 2 of the 2nd item options (except collector) or GA mortal reminder bloodthirster QSS depending on what you need on an individual or team level. The only two items I would consider unusable for (most) adcs right now are quickblades and stormrazor. Everything else has a place.   If you have been building every game on every adc how you described in that comment then you are very simply hard trolling. Riot have basically said themselves they think adc itemisation is in a good spot if they didnt they would have patched up the holes in preseason.

hma8tet,Outfox3D,11/27/2021,1,83.0,The problem is that you have to be able to stick to a target BEFORE you get access to the range increase and that the combat stats it offers (to ranged) are very lackluster. So you have to be a champion that can stick to a target safely for the windup that then somehow still needs extra range (despite being able to stick) that also doesnt need a rune that gives combat power in lane.   Theres maybe ... 3 champions I can think of where this rune MIGHT be a workable decision and maybe 1 or 2 more where it could concievably be good. Its super niche. Its strong but super super niche.

hma8um9,Gerblinoe,11/27/2021,1,,Ok have you ever gone through somebody having a medical emergency?   Because once they are in the hospital there is not that much you can do and with covid times you cant even sit at their bed the whole day  And you need to do something because sitting in your bed and just thinking is literally the worst feeling   So you smash some mindless arams. And for a proper depression aram mode 6 a day aint that much   Upset flew back because he decided that whatever happened his wife shouldnt go alone through  Is it a sickness in family? Is it death in family? Is it a miscarriage? I dont know   But with all of those options trying to find something to do to just stop thinking preferably with her seems pretty believable

There are several preset themes to choose from (Piltover and Zaun for example I used the steampunk theme) then I used the region names as the keyword to generate the pictures. I had to cheat on Freljord and Shurima because weren’t rendering anything close to those so I added the words snow and desert to the region names. Sorry I forgot about The Void Bandle City and Ixtal.

hma9aqw,Coolestdude123,11/27/2021,1,,I kind of agree with you.  I think it is pretty obvious from everything that Upsets wife was saying she was depressed. And then the day before worlds she probably called him crying or something and then he rushed him.  So he went home and to cheer her up he played some ARAM.  This fits with everything anyone has said on the issue and with the actions.  We know:  1 It was an issue going on for several weeks that got worse just before worlds (a sudden event)  2 It was to do with his wife - Yamato in the interview linked the two when talking about it he said how dedicated upset was for grinding after this marriage and how it was really tough for him at the time (why the fuck would you get married during the season rather than waiting till the offseasons I have no idea).   3 Upset wont say the reason because people will question if it is a legit reason and harass his wife.  4 Adam said his wife was feeling lonely which fits.  5 Fits with all the wife buff comments from bwipos gf that they later said was a coincidence (obviously it wasnt lol).

hmcrabs,MrMonday11235,11/27/2021,1,490.0,As evidenced by the fact that most of the actually powerful good- or neutral-aligned champions (Ryze/Azir/Soraka/Nasus/Anivia) didnt step in to do anything the only conclusion that can reasonably be drawn is that Ruination wasnt actually a threat to the world at large just an incredibly flashy inconvenience.  That or Riot didnt really think through the actual lore implications of an event like Ruination only featuring a handful of champions most of whom dont really rate highly on the lore power scale and thats why they retroactively blew it into the non-canoniverse but lets try to give some credit.

hmbhp2u,Rias-senpai,11/27/2021,1,303.0,>Lethal Tempos range bonus for ADCs is only noticeable when the team is ahead when behind the ADC is mostly fighting people off themselves. A range increase does nothing when bruisers and assassins are sitting on your face.  Considering the amount of peel you receive in soloQ aswell the rune has very low value compared to the old LT. By the time youve autod someone 6 times in a fight youre usually past the point where 100 extra range is what allows you to space around the outskirts of a teamfight.   The laning power that most people who used LT before lost feels far greater than any situation Ive been in a teamfight with the new LT when Ive a 100 extra range but lower DPS and still have to play around some melee character in my face.

hmahvzt,SP3EDI,11/27/2021,1,376.0,of course there is. Faker would never demand of others to inform them about everything so he can decide if it was valid enough reason in his books or not. If you knew even a little thing about faker then you would know that he values family and privacy extremely high. Just like Hily did without much drama.

hm9uiml,Alex_Wizard,11/27/2021,1,19.0,The bounty system has increased game times across the board. Because the average game time is longer late game champions indirectly got a major buff. Pair that with things like First Strike injecting a lot of early gold or Lethal Tempo ramping up carries earlier in the game and you get things like Viktor coming online when he completes crown and then taking over if the enemy team makes one mistake and gives him a bounty objective.   Either the bounty system needs to be refined more or every late game champ is going to have to get adjusted to compensate for the new game times.

hm9l5zg,notaboxlor,11/27/2021,1,2.0,I agree that resistances are pointless. Ive been a tank many times going full armour against all AD teams and they get one pen item and youre useless.   Lord doms is broken against tanks as most tank items give defence and health so you basically get punished for it.   Also items in general have too many stats and bonus effects like percentage health damage shields slows etc.   Main problem for me is when they changed everything to %s.

hm9b7bz,Swing_Youth,11/27/2021,1,29.0,Its such an interesting blend of personal preference and practicality. At the very beginning it probably is best to try lots of champs out to find your favorite playstyle/position - but this will come at the cost of your chances to win or do well in games because you wont know the champion very well. So after that I think theres great merit in picking one or two champions to main (play the most and become expert on) because once you become proficient on a champion you will be able to focus on the other elements of the game outside of just controlling your character (and those external elements are what will elevate your gameplay the most).  Its actually very fun picking a main. They dont have to be a strong champion in the meta right now pick someone who you like the mechanics/vibe/lore/aesthetic of! Ive been playing League for yeeeears and play the same 3 champions in about 90% of games! The other ones dont inspire me in the same way.
hm93dl0,be_like_neo,11/27/2021,1,16.0,99% of bad jhin players would start that fight with ult lol. I just wish people realized that jhin should be autoing in fights not doing 100 dmg per ult from a screen away

hmbemk4,MoonDawg2,11/27/2021,1,,makes complete sense taking in count the meta at worlds tbh. Iirc it was basically lucian mf being spammed 24/7 and both of those champs loved galeforce on that meta since they barely scale with atk speed.  No idea what the other guy was saying though.

hmbhwz8,nitko87,11/27/2021,1,303.0,I like new LT. It feels like Conqueror but with attack speed instead of AD and doesn’t have lifesteal. It’s good for champs that wanna stick to you and you can still stop those champs with cc. It’s really not as problematic as people make it out to be players just don’t draft well around it.  It’s easy to say a champ that uses LT is broken with the rune when they stomp a volatile matchup but these champs still have counters

hma3d30,tautckus1,11/27/2021,1,149.0,Bwipo refused a 800k offer in his rookie year from na. Multiple times he said he doesnt care for na. This worlds he got scapegoated to hell and back and finally gave in. If he had a normal.worlds you can bet he would be on fnc as the franchise player as he was meant to be. Adam was being built up for all summer and playoffs to be a key player whose playstyle was all about sacking lane and tping bot/mid. Nisqy was having the split of his life yet due to his playstyle being roam bot and havint a shit worlds is now out of a team. If fnatic had their roster they make atleast quarters and this squad 9/10  times stays the same. Even if they dont none of them would of got crucified by the community like they did during worlds. Only upset has 0 blame whilst he is the main reason for this teams implosion
hmacjt7,Random_Stealth_Ward,11/27/2021,1,57.0,No no thats a misconception created due to People in this sub basically doing a telephone game of slowly twisting the first message.   The event is canon and there is an overall narrative that the event followed e.g. traveling and forming a group of sentinels recruiting the sentinel team in regions Viego taking the shards of isolde etc.  Rookie is at least last a rioter that talked about it and I saw it canon.  What isnt canon is the way its shown (as in the interactions and stuff) partly because there were a few different interpretations between versions and the event is intended as light hearted (for some reason). So for example Rengar likely wasnt a third person talker that randomly dropped the act after finding the letter I Diana Probably wasnt a deadweight who was just there taking space hopefully Olaf wasnt really calmed down because Rookie invoked talk-no-jutsu etc.

hmcsus2,theelementalflow,11/27/2021,1,43.0,I still feel that Svenskeren would be top 3. Hes better than Blabber internationally as well. DL is still a top adc imo given that he can compete with pros after watching the inhouse. Jensen is still a top 2 with a deep champion pool.  &#x200B  This team can easily be top 3 or win NALCS. Bjergsen/CoreJJ looks scary but so does C9 with Summit and Berserker. I believe Berserker will be a top ADC next season.  &#x200B  With more dominate lanes Svenskeren can shine for sure. He had to play around Jizuke whos a coinflip so its hard to play a round. Jensen is a lot more consistent. Look what happened when he went from TSM to C9 and was unleashed by being able to play how he wanted. He carried NA to worlds Semis in 2018.

hma5ssi,Umbrabro,11/27/2021,1,13.0,Because the community is shit sure they can play for fun with friends or whatever but rank is a wasteland.
hmda9ou,WTF_Scuba,11/27/2021,1,170.0,There is a lot of upcoming talent in the LCS this year. Yes quite a few of them are imports but that is a separate conversation IMO. Across all positions we already have:  * Fudge (C9) * Berseker (C9) * Winsome (C9) * Isles (C9) * Tenacity (100T) * Jenkins (CLG) * Palafox (CLG) * Luger (CLG) * Poome (CLG) * FakeGod (DIG) * Blue (DIG) * Neo (DIG) * Jojopyun (EG) * Danny (EG) * Toucouille (FLY) * Ablazeolive (GG) * Lost (GG) * Revenge (IMT) * Destiny (IMT)  Sure there is a varying degree of experience between the players but overall they are relatively inexperienced and have a lot of potential. You can downvote me and spit out the same old narratives of NA importing talent but Im excited for this season and welcome all of these up-and-coming players. If the cost is a few middling veteran players then so be it.
hmap587,chocolate_kat,11/27/2021,1,476.0,\>Fix it in one hour or youre banned.  holy based
hm8v6yu,daddymateriial,11/27/2021,1,18.0,This is the first comment that actually gave me a tip and was helpful (besides the top two comments). I could fake agency a lot more. I play way too confidently and I always lose 1v2s by 1 hp a lot.
hmazk6n,Sktwin2k15,11/27/2021,1,,Thats a great advice. I maybe can balance this if I just give up the drive mentality while playing and keep it as my relaxation method.

hmd7m8y,a_brick_canvas,11/27/2021,1,170.0,It’s not that they’re not able but if they would want to do this for essentially free with no team. And if they were wanting to then they could easily be signed on together for minimum LCS salaries to play together.
hmcywwp,ILikeSomeStuff482,11/27/2021,1,87.0,If we had an open scene 80% of the talent we have wouldnt have been discovered. They would just flame out in lower leagues not getting paid just like in CSGO.

hmad1ig,Exclarius,11/27/2021,1,310.0,Reread my comment. If you can deal with stress/trauma in a way where you will always be of clear mind and will always make the most logical decisions then more power to you. But people deal with stress/grief in different ways. You cannot decide for someone how they should deal with it.  > big chillin with your wife grinding arams and soloque  Youre making this sound as if he was just playing for fun as if he want to his holiday home in the Bahamas.

hmcr9m6,vbelur,11/27/2021,1,456.0,Beyond me why they don’t just give +adaptive for melee vs giving range. 100 range is just straight OP on melees cuz it breaks their relative play pattern(one that has been relatively consistent for years) being that they have fixed ranges that players get used to with certain abilities that give them either(rarely) additional range threat(classifying a gap closer in here.) or ms.

hma79j9,AmazingNumber4405,11/27/2021,1,14.0,After watching this I realize their supervisor was another hidden gem on snake that helped to put them into the right mindset to go on a huge winning streak. They have literally won 6 bo5s in a row. Wish LPL would do one on team WE lmao those 2 games lost to EDG was the beginning of the end for them.
hmagrf9,CurrentRisk,11/27/2021,1,26.0,Imo it’s the best way to play either mute all or disabled chat. Chat is useless nowadays everything can be done through pings.   Also level means nothing. A level 200 can be just as “trash” as you. You can improve though don’t get into that negative cycle. Remember it’s a game after all!

hmcdf81,BringBackAH,11/27/2021,1,75.0,Noxus is a militaristic meritocraty where everyone is free and can climb as long as they follow orders and believe that their life style must be brought to the rest of the world via conquest.  Demacia is an aristocratic monarchy where people live freely as long as they share the ideal of justice. They believe magic is a threat to humanity therefore get rid of them on their territory but have little to no interest in world conquest.  Both sides have good and bad points. Mix Demacias belief in justice and Noxus belief of equality and youll get the perfect place to live in runeterra

hma379p,9percentmilk,11/27/2021,1,27.0,I loved the original music for Arcane which unfortunately makes the Imagine Dragons stuff so much worse by comparison. I’ll never understand why they had such talent to lean on and they decided to go with bland pop rock from a decade ago for the theme.

hmd3zuo,Eaglekingoftheskies,11/27/2021,1,25.0,I mean did you even what the Legends of runterra shurima cinimatic?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6qzJfh148  Its true that a the champions from that region are generally north african inspired but the extended universe has them as a different blend of reguins and the shurimans introduced in lor are all pretty clearly black. The protagonist of that trailer even has a swahili  name. Omari.   https://www.artstation.com/artwork/B1DAGz   Its also worth noting that shurima isnt just one area its the name of the entire southern countinent. So it makes sense that there are soome black people from shurima. Even azirs human form looked black. I think Shurima is supposed to be africa and parts of asia in general instead of just strictly north african.

hmbnmc2,W1ndwardFormation,11/27/2021,1,156.0,I mean jinx was always meant to be one of the main faces of league wasn’t she the first champ getting her own cinematic with get jinxed ?
hmd90oi,Stfuego,11/27/2021,1,80.0,Lore wise with the context of Arcane added in Sett absolutely destroys Vi if she keeps blocking with her face as Ekko points out.  With regards to their in-game kit Vi might have a better chance considering Sett needs another opponent to knock heads together. Otherwise the other skills are very similar in nature. Vi would run out of gas eventually though as Sett doesnt really have an expendable resource.
hmaons6,MoonDawg2,11/27/2021,1,139.0,But on both of those champs its actually shit?  Lethal is good on steroid adc aka jinx ashe kog and uh... Vayne-ish when shes at 2 items.

hmb02pc,LoLrovex,11/27/2021,1,341.0,Yone after lethal tempo is just an absurd champion that needs to be nerfed it has good gank prevention fighting and outplay potential ALL throughout the game. Playing ADCs top require you to be strongsided by your entire team basically which isnt reliable in soloq so I always try to avoid them. Be consistent dont die to ganks and stay ahead of everyone else.

hmc7bj4,homer12346,11/27/2021,1,8.0,>After 11.17 and their super update to the Clients mainframe or whatever that supposedly shouldve amazingly improved the Client with no more lag no more post match errors quicker times to open runes in champ select  citations needed that just seems like your headcanon so you can go back and flame them when there are still issues related to the client in the game afterwards  ***  for me the post game screen only goes blank once every 20 games or so its noticable but at the same time i only look at damage charts and then move on to the next game so who cares

hmbpcg2,Berserk72,11/27/2021,1,86.0,The problem is we have no idea what the pandemic did to schedules. Ruined King is great but late. SoL was on time but buggy and poor quality. The novels didnt match the in game event that did not the cinematic. Even the champion design in particular Vex also missed deadlines but at least was not unfinished.   The concept was amazing and I would love to see attempted again but the execution was just not Riot standard which Arcane rubbed the salt in. Runed King is a solid 8-9 game 30 hours for 30 bucks.   For Lucian and Senna lets hope Thresh pulls them back in because those 3 are some of the most popular characters even post SoL.

hmbrek7,Farler,11/27/2021,1,70.0,Im a pyke main. My personal opinion is its just a snowbally item only worth getting on mid pyke. Heres the thing. You have 6 item slots. 4 of those are gonna be supp item boots mythic (usually duskblade) and Umbral glaive (absolutely OP broken for a support). Youre left with two more slots one of which is gonna be youmuus (great lethality and good for both in and out of combat movespeed). Usually your last item is something defensive like maw edge of night deaths dance or GA. Axiom just doesnt fit in and by that point in the game pyke ult is on a really low CD anyways.  Mid pyke its totally worth as a second item though because you have at least one slot freed up from supp item and maybe even a 2nd freed up because Umbral isnt mandatory just good if you want to help your support with vision control (which you should).

hma71cz,Reiir,11/27/2021,1,145.0,Fully agree with Doublelift (even though I really dont like his personality). Then again most of League pros are petulant children who havent had the opportunity to learn proper social skills thus believing that the excuse kids in highschool use to dodge class (i.e urgent family matters) works when so much money and honestly peoples futures are on the line.   I have 0 sympathy for Upset in this case as I think there are ways to explain your situation to your own teammates without breaching the privacy of your loved ones where everyone at least understands why youre leaving.

hmd0ps9,Zorrodx,11/27/2021,1,,I disagree entirely. It’s not he was poor in wave management at all Bwipo used his timings better and knew the timings where Sniper could die way better than he did he would call out deaths even before the games even began in game 1 did just that. and macro he probably knows what he did wrong better than anyone in this thread. Bwipo is actually just too good + it was a straight team gap. The team play from cores team was way too good for any one player to overcome  the thing is Bwipo knew how to play the tank v carry matchup better than sniper which is expected.   He’s just a kid surrounded by guys who have played for way longer plus sad to say but doublelift kinda sorta ran it the entire series and the whole blaming draft thing in game 1 was a little…boring.

hmd342t,Braiwnz,11/27/2021,1,48.0,What why are you simping a company so heavy?!  They are not giving you real money it’s their own in Game currency. It’s not worth a dime. You use it to buy ingame stuff that keeps you hooked to their game which essentially makes them more money. They aren’t „giving you stuff for free“ without profiting.  Also back in s1 and s2 you could easily get tripple the amount just from playing tournaments (no matter the elo) doing quests inviting „friends“.  The game has (understandably) taken it’s heavy turns towards commercialization and it has taken its toll. On the other side it gives us stuff like Arcane Riot GameS etc. but the guy is right the game back then was designed towards the average consumer to have fun for a couple of hours. Doesn’t mean we had to stay there forever.
hmc728n,LeatherBodybuilder,11/27/2021,1,276.0,> a path that every game bought by Tencent falls into.  dae chinese bad??!?!?  jfc the sinophobia on this sub is so disgusting.  Everything you dont like is the fault of tencent or the chinese playerbase.  Riot stopped doing winter maps before Tencent even took full ownership of the company and why the fuck would Tencent even give a shit about Riot making a winter map?  Riot literally created ultimate spellbook this year which definitely took more work than coloring the map white but sure keep bullshitting about profit. Its actually so goddamn cringe.  The winter maps wont even be enabled for ranked so it literally makes no sense for Riot to waste time and effort into making something a minority of players will use and be shelved again after a few months.

hmcw4y3,TheWalrius,11/27/2021,1,54.0,But hes not. He said feeding which is a generic term for They are losing by a vague amount and Im mad about it.. Some people accuse others of feeding for 2-3 deaths.   And you cant hold hostages past the initial ff@15. If 40% of your team votes no thats not holding hostages.  His argument is people playing poorly shouldnt decide on surrender votes. And thats a bad take all around.
hmbytmu,MoonDawg2,11/27/2021,1,,? It was the biggest issue of old lethal. It was too easy to prock if you were playing correctly leading to massive waste of the rune. No idea if for some reason people on reddit have no idea how to poke pre-fight with high range adc but it was a common complain among high elo adc players  Conq is correct too. Against bruisers it was better while lethal was decently better against squishies.

hmao780,DanteStorme,11/27/2021,1,85.0,I get what youre trying to say but your point doesnt make sense.  Its along the same lines as complaining that AD champs cant use ap items because not having ap scalings on their abilities makes them useless.  Its the same for thornmail champs that dont have cc cant use the 60% gw effect because they dont have cc abilities making it worse for them.  Some items are intentionally itemised like this to make it worse for specific subclasses.  Thats why there are so many items with different effects for ranged and melee champs. (demonic botrk etc) which is exactly the same example as this.
hmbwlj7,J0k3d,11/27/2021,1,14.0,its not that shes that strong is just that poke is 200% more valuable in aram.   Veigar is one example of champ that gets much stroger because of the idea of the gamemode. His Stun is half the map and he deals a TON of damage. But in SR he is pretty normal to deal with.  But Nidalee basically cant go melee because she mostly dies if she straight jumps in someone and he flashes. And as you said you can die to 2 lances but even if youre 3 items and you keep missing all spears most of your damage goes to waste even if you have lower cooldowns. So shes not THAT reliable when ahead .

hma674q,supapumped,11/27/2021,1,2.0,I understand it can be frustrating but read back the last part of what you said. “They seem to enjoy it dying over and over and seeing people rage” If they are doing it for the sole purpose of making somebody rage and you rage at them then your giving them exactly what they want. Gotta starve the trolls of attention or else they will keep going back to get their “fix”.   On the flip side if they are just having a bad game and you flame them then more than likely they won’t start playing any better because you yell at them. Higher chance they just start raging back and what focus they did have for the game shifts to arguing with you making them play worse.  Either way your best course of action is to just mute them and if you really feel like you have to say something type it in the post game chat and then move on with your life.  Good luck!
hma1qtr,anghellous,11/27/2021,1,115.0,Any chance you guys could look at Shaco clone not applying sheen? Before item rework it used to apply sheen procs but now it doesnt. This sorta limits build options quite a bit.

hmascwk,reverent-girl,11/27/2021,1,15.0,MMR is not your problem. Your problem is your attitude. Statistically you will win on average 50% of your games you play. That being said with a small sample size losing 15 of 20 is very common. Your MMR probably has not changed much especially if you have played over 100 Aram games at some point in the past.   I would recommend taking a one week break from the game. If you are not having fun then your mental is not in the right place. Yah its fun winning but its also fun learning new champs watching other players do cool things or get a penta kill having friendly banter in chat etc.  I always have the most fun playing after a little break. Plz do yourself and your teammates a favor and take at least a week off. Why would you play something uou dont enjoy? If all you want is to win then play games that dont involve directly competing against other people.

I think they have like 4-5 albums of which like 10 songs ever became super mainstream? Maybe in your country they were on the radio all the time but I can name  a lot if artists/ songs that I got  more sick of before even thinking of imagine dragons.

hmb9xj5,DudeMcAwesome95,11/27/2021,1,264.0,Yea for ADCs the new LT is a complete joke. The extra range is completely broken but 9 out of 10 times youre not even getting max stacks before the teamfight is over. Twitch for example relies a lot on opening up a fight from his Q+R this worked well with the old LT since you could stack it beforehand using your W now your R duration is virtually over by the time youve hit max stacks and everyone is dead or you are.  If theyre going to keep the 30% AS boost for ranged then the cap needs to be removed from the first stack for ranged only so that champs can actually have the chance to stack it before a TF is over... or yknow just revert the fucking rune.

hm90zc5,Head_Haunter,11/27/2021,1,196.0,I dont know the exact details but he got stuck at gold 1 for a while. Like several weeks despite playing 8 hours or more a day.   Like 300 or 400 games. Dont quote me on that I just know it was like a shitton of games.   I kind of mentioned it earlier but part of the reason is because he was playing on a brand new account with brand new MMR so he never got to skip any divisions or got any high LP gains. Every game was like 15 LP gain and 14 LP loss so if he had a 50% winrate over 20 games it would have been a net of like 20 LP for 20 games which is excruciatingly slow.   Another reason Gold 1 was a huge hurdle is because there are a lot of smurfs in Gold 1 because a lot of those people naturally decay to around there. Its just the most common smurf elo.
hm9vqhz,nyasiaa,11/27/2021,1,69.0,they should hire people making custom map skins if they dont wanna do it themselves people have done so many cool map skins that could bring riot a lot of money if they got official support  people are still updating old summoners rift maps winter maps etc. from patch to patch (and riot is doing *everything* in their power to kill custom skins so thats really impressive) give that official support sell it in shop for RP and it would be great  if an old summoners rift map was available in the shop I would buy it insantly not even thinking about anything I just like it so much more

Im not supposed to 1v1 a tank? That would be true but not for the current reason. Currently you cant 1v1 a tank because they massacre any squishy with 1 combo. What it SHOULD be is: You cant 1v1 a tank because you dont have enough dmg to kill him before he kills you eventually by sustained dmg and cc.  Also he is so ahead? 1 more lvl and 1 more item. He has 10 kills 14 assists 163 farm. I have 11 kills 6 assists 203 farm. We are almost equal he is a bit more ahead than me gold-wise. On a tank is that enough to literally obliterate someone who is just slightly less ahead than you in 7 seconds?

If you dont like AFK or say any buzz-words from Riots no-no-words list then youre gonna be absolutely fine.   &#x200B  You can mute toxic people yet people who intentionally feed a game can ruin it with no repercussion and they as a company choose to focus on the thing that players themselves actually can control - and choose to see that as the root of all bad experiences in the game. I by no means want to justify being toxic towards anyone whether in game or life in general but the people I meet in the game that choose to be toxic I just mute instantly and then its dealt with.

hmcwru7,Vizioso,11/27/2021,1,20.0,Youre not going to get better/learn the game by playing with a bunch of other people who are also brand new.  Playing with more experienced players affords you the opportunity to figure out your shortcomings much faster and correct them.    Case in point:   I started playing in October of this year.   The last time I played a MOBA was basically when Heroes of Newerth first came out.  I started off doing normal Blind Pick games and got myself to M7 on Fiddlesticks pretty quickly entirely in Blind Pick.  I had a 61% win rate a 3.0 KDA 150 CS score 20k average damage etc. across all games.  I *genuinely* thought that through looking up builds and watching some videos I had somehow actually gotten good at the game and maybe I knew what I was doing.  Quickly approaching L30 I started doing Normal Draft games on Fiddle.  41% win rate 1.3 KDA 101 CS 12k damage.  And Id wager that its only that good because of some fluke games in the mix where I got carried.  The difference between the two is that all the people in the Blind Pick games were sub level 30 many actual new accounts like myself.  The Draft games were people with at least some experience for the most part.  I thought I was learning how to do things the right way because I was winning games in Blind but I was really just learning how to beat up people who had even less of a clue what they were doing than I did.  After getting my ass kicked for a little while in Draft games I was pretty quickly able to start correcting my mistakes and actually learn how to play the game.  Something I would not have been able to do against only players of my experience level.

hmd35lr,TheEshOne,11/27/2021,1,569.0,I like this argument but I believe it only asserts that LeBlanc *can* be the main character rather than that she simply *is* the main character.  The phrase I am everyone implies a surjection from {LeBlanc} --> {Aatrox Ahri Akali ... Zoe Zyra} (assuming that she is only referring to the LoL champ roster). We know that one of these champs is the main character but all others are not. Therefore there is exactly one instance in which LeBlanc will be the main character but there are many instances in which she will not. This asserts that she *can* be the main character.  To assert that she *is* (always) the main character you would need to create an inverse map from {Main character} --> {LeBlanc}. This only exists in the case of specific characters like Neeko and Viego (who can become Leblanc) or in the trivial case if LeBlanc truly was the main character from the start.

Its not like its at 95 and the other drakes are at 70 the difference is marginal at the 86-91 range. Its definitely strong than the other drakes Im not arguing that but its not the apocalypse end all be all. Statistically youre losing no matter what the soul is its just marginally more winning.

Because as far as I know Bwipo and Nisqy havent spoken about this situation and Hylissang and the the FNATIC management felt it was justified hence why they are keeping Upset on the team.

hma0eiw,takato99,11/27/2021,1,21.0,People say Riot is a music company but tbh they just have such a perfect eye for collaboration and finding the right people. Be it how they founded the original dev team the artists that do the splash arts the music team the artists they collab with (Imagine dragons Ray Chen...etc) Fortiche studio and the other animation studios they worked with some of their writers (the ones from 40K etc) the casters they work with some of the leagues production crews and many other fields  The company really has a talent for finding talents to work with

To me thats overturned. Its like when Serpants was perma buy on every assassin most of the season before they nerves it regardless as to whether or not the enemy has any legit shield threats  Look Im an ADC main but even I can step back and say its too strong an item.

Even if you are right but as a Korean why cant I give a special love to this character?    by the way its name Ahri(아리) actually comes from a Korean sentence **아리**땁다(ahriddapda) which means old or poetic expression of 아름답다(areumdapda beautiful in English)

Shieldbow also gets taken on Jinx with success at an 8% pick rate. Lower than Kraken and Galeforce but still gets picked and still performs well.

hm9kgdy,lawfulkitten1,11/27/2021,1,31.0,There are people who get paid millions of dollars (/ pounds / your preferred currency) a year to play sports who still know when its the right time to give up. Think about teams in team sports (basketball football etc.) who pull their starters with time still left on the board and a theoretical 0.0000001% chance that you could still win the game. Now compare that to the average league player who is probably studying and/or has a job and certainly isnt getting paid millions of dollars to play solo queue games.... can you really blame them for surrendering at 15 minutes rather than dragging out that game to 30+ minutes just on the <1% chance enemy team makes a huge throw from an unloseable postion?

hmc356h,Linyoa,11/27/2021,1,24.0,Big agree and not to mention again the spear is slow as shit. Way slower than most mages skill at 1300 with a fairly small hitbox. 1300 is one thing for a fairly short range projectile like Kayle Q (1500) but for something thats super long range thats crazy slow. Thresh q has a speed of 1900 by comparison. You can straight up be hit by some cc have the nidalee throw a q on reaction and then get out of the cc and dodge before it actually hits you its that slow.  Literally. just. dodge.   Or just make reddit threads about how the 49% winrate champ is op.

hm9eand,CoogiMonster,11/27/2021,1,31.0,This.  You’re going to give them ruined skins… isn’t that kind of redundant?  Like the whole point here was the other characters being pulled into the ruination by being possessed (draven karma etc.) or by joining the Sentinels.

hmc623u,Blue_Seraph,11/27/2021,1,,>The problem is majority of ADCs cannot be played elsewhere at all.  Which isnt really a problem because it is deliberate. Ever since the Marksman+Support meta cemented itself Riot has started designing and balancing Marksmen around the idea of them going botlane. And for good reason Id argue.  Every time Marksmen bleed out of the farming botlane role it feels like shit playing against them.  Lucian mid/top Quinn top/mid Vayne top Tristana mid Varus mid well executed Fasting Senna Twitch jungle and even the most tame on in Corki mid are all extremely oppressive. Because whether ADC mains like to admit it or not most ADCs have way better level 1-3 than most of the rest of the roster just by virtue of having potent ranged autos. Add their personal gimmicks into the mix and they have a fair shot at snowballing the lane. Problem is by virtue of being ranged autoattackers they also scale way better than any other damage-dealing class in the game so any time a typical botlane Marksman gets too prevalent in another lane they ***have to*** get nerfed into oblivion.  &#x200B  Even when Riot tries to specifically design a Marksman for another lane things get out of hand really easily. It took a while - and a soft rework - before Kindred stopped being super polarizing. Now that Quinn is officially a toplaner she not only gets toplane mains up in arms every time shes mentioned but is also closely monitored by Riot. Akshan has a whole slew of things that make him a balance nightmare but being a Marksman and being able to rely on autos for damage if all else fails is definitely one of them. And do I really need to talk about Graves ?  &#x200B  Champions like Syndra and Ziggs finding success bot isnt a giant red flag as much as it is testament to the strength of the Marksman class. Because picking mages botlane is done ***as a conscious effort to shut down the enemy Marksman***. This is why they have high winrates. Not because mages are OP botlane but because ***shutting down the enemy Marksman is the best way to secure the win***.   Seeing how 0.5% pickrate mages bot have 52-53% winrate is all fun and games until you take a look at the winate/time curve and see that ***mage bot winrates fall off a cliff after the 20 minute mark.*** Even Karthus !   And you want to know why ? No class deals damage as reliably as Marksmen making your teamcomp automatically worse past the 20 minute mark if you dont have one. Weve even seen it play out multiple times in the Worlds championship this year. Ziggs bot getting somewhat of an advantage early-mid game only to fall flat and miss 3/4 of his unreliable-ass skillshots during teamfights and autolosing his team the game while the enemy Aphelios casually shreds through everyone.  &#x200B  So yes I ***actually do understand*** the whole situation with ADC  Marksmen are the most reliable damage dealers in the game. They will often do nearly as much damage per crit as mages do with their basic damage abilities come mid-late game... except Autos are point and click with .5 seconds CD so they have virtually no downtime to exploit. So yes they were given a big weakness in their lack of agency and their lack of agency relegate them botlane and prevent them - in most cases - from being as proactive as other classes. But yall need to understand that this is a ***much needed tradeoff*** if we dont want them to just take over all of the other lanes.

hmajxrw,ablack16,11/27/2021,1,8.0,It’s not difficult at all to counter her E. You just have to push towards her and have non predictable movement patterns. Or you stand by the creeps so if she hits you with it she pushes the lane. You are clearly upset about losing lane phase to her but xerath is honestly worse since he has 3 abilities that are fairly easy to land and a mana return but again countering ranged harass is only tough if you don’t force them to push or dodge and counter initiate and make them waste summoners. Get good lux is fine

hmbsx31,ElectronicBoss1,11/27/2021,1,236.0,bro Ive been heavy on this for the last 2 years I am so pissed they decided to just stop making winter map.  It was a time of year to look forward to for many reasons and league was one of those reasons. It brings so much nostalgia and joy to a beautiful time of the year and they just randomly axe it like they cant celebrate Christmas or something.      Whoever made that decision is literally scrooge.      They could literally make 6 figures by just releasing a buyable version of the winter map through the store with RP so cost/resources is not the issue. I would buy it in a heart beat and I know many people who would too.      If time is an issue why not just pick up one of these people that coded up a custom winter map skin in their basement?      I have legit played on custom winter map skins and they are of excellent quality. So how does riot drop the ball on 1 map being a multi 7-8 or even 9 figure company at this point?      I have too many thoughts about this cant even contain myself like literally I just want to have a conversation with the person that decided there would no longer be a winter map and hear how they feel about disappointing all of their most loyal players that has been with them since day 1.      Without your day 1s this game would have never been a thing and look what its evolved to now.      Riot if youre reading this. Just please give us winter map back its really not a big ask from a company of your caliber. Plus its Christmas time cmon now everyone on here is looking at you like you guys are the sticky bandits grinch scrooge etc - because youre worried you may not make any money on producing it or dont want to pay one of your current or a new developer to create it.      Just do something nice for us and if you want me to pay $20 to play on that map I wouldnt even question it.

hmb8odi,-Falrein,11/27/2021,1,52.0,Theres no such thing as a single main character on Runeterra.  Sure Ryze travels around and gathers the World Runes so they dont end up destroying the world. I dont think that makes him the center point of Runeterra.  Each character has different scopes and powers and levels of influence but it doesnt make them lesser or better. They all influence the world in their own way some more than others. They all deserve to have their stories told they are all main character of their own stories.  Ryze is a main character. Of many.

hma9mzo,fojek17,11/27/2021,1,10.0,baron has mechanics. Most of his skills are dodgeable for example  \-back spikes  \-tail knockup  \-creating three circular slowing puddles  \-that line travieling vomit-like skillshot  Auto attacks on the other hand should not be dodgeable as they are.  Drake still has some mechanics but much less and thats good because its suppoused to be easier to take.  \-knockup on waekup  \-standing correctly not to get hit by aoe auto attacks  And of course all of them have the mechanic of patience for resetting / keeping aggro

Say a P2 player will have 51%wr in P2 but 48%wr in D4  But say someone plays 500 ranked games in a year then he only has a net loss of 10 games which probably isnt enough to demote.

hm9aqla,musashihokusai,11/27/2021,1,9.0,Might have been true a few years ago but these days support is about as impactful as jg.   If my ADC knows how to shove and play safe I’m off ganking mid or invading with my jg.   Or if I’m feeling it I’ll just play something like Xer or Brand and turn bot into a kill lane.   If there’s a fasting Senna our team has two juggernauts.   JG- Easiest role to climb on. You see a lane winning camp and snowball. Play a duelist and invade unless premade no one is coming to help. AND once you get good at the role you might just auto win via knowledge check because it’s the most autofilled role.   Mid- Easiest lane to just afk farm and out rotate for objectives/teamfights. Least volatile so even when you get a Smurf you can play a little conservative and contribute to team.   Support- Essentially a second jg who doesn’t farm. Gank mid. Invade with your jg. Or pick champs like Brand or Swain and turn bot into a kill lane.   Top- super volatile. One bad trade might set you so far behind you’ve lost lane five minutes in. Every mistake is extremely punishable. Even when you get a lead you might lose it very quickly from split lapse in vision or unexpected roam.   ADC- In a premade very important but in solo queue your tanks WILL flash engage and leave you for dead. Expect zero peel and all the blame when you get dove by two assassins.   Mid then Support. In that order are the easier roles to climb on.

Yes Riot is making so many amazing things WHICH ARE NOT LEAGUE. The flagship product of their company seems to get the least amount of love from the devs and this is a big problem. Dont be a Riot apologist. They have thounsands of employees and if one independent creator can recreate a working Winter map in his spare time in less than a month a paid Riot employee can do that even faster.

hmcag4k,KosViik,11/27/2021,1,405.0,Its not just the cases where it is hard. It is also the cases where it is inconsequential. You missed that point of mine.  Take most teamfights midgame (where most of the game gets decided anyway) ADCs on average will have 1-1.2 attack speed around this stage of the game (Jinx passive is a fringe case but it still falls in the same category as my point). Even if you are constantly attacking (which chances are you wont be as you will be repositioning from the inevitable engages on you or using skills) it will take 5 seconds.   In that five seconds more often than not either you will die to something one of your teammates will die to something or the enemy dies to something. At that point you could be rocking basically any rune the fight is most likely decided.  >Theres not much point making an argument about getting 1 shot by assassins or if your team has one because at that point your rune choice wont matter anyway.  Fleet users get a decent burst of movement speed and heal some chip damage off which is more than 5% attack speed which is a generic-purpose rune anyone can take. DH users can always get a lucky proc off (even with skills which is generally longer thus safer range for the users). HOB users (lol) get more attack speed for that short appearance they make in a teamfight (chances are HOB is not more common is because of the precision Slot 2-3 runes being superior to most things domination offers). It basically beats Conqueror which nobody takes (besides Samira but she wont take LT ever)  and goes toe-to-toe on PTA depending on who you ask on what champion.   ---  The game has been about frontloaded stats for a while now or whoever can manifest the quickest stacking of a rune for that capped power (remember Aatrox being an absolute menace before the first gutting of Conqueror way back?). A rune like LT wont make much of a difference until the ADCs get back actual tanky targets *they* have to melt because nobody else can feasibly do it without sending themselves on a cooldown breather.  Lethal tempo provides very little frontloaded power and ADCs have a tough time stacking it (Yone and the likes have more than enough survivability to stack at which point they have the much higher payout too).  Im not saying it is a bad rune but people should really stop worshipping it like it is the second coming of Phreak. Its an okay rune for Caitlyn and Jinx depending on the enemy comp a solid or terrible choice for Ashe and Kog depending on  their comp (whether they can provide you safety). If you feel LT was a huge contributor in a teamfight good for you chances are either you wouldve stomped it almost as hard without it or the enemy had a brainfart (or it is the 1/1000 game where nobody but you can kill the enemy tanks).  LTs value will drastically increase if and when Riot shifts back from people being one shot left and right *(as if ever...)* as such high-caliber sustained damage dealers become a factor in team comps.

Even the runes I believe were dropped into Runeterra by the celestials to give the Runeterrans access to more powerful magic. Although Im not a lore expert so that may not be 100% accurate.

But infact it was alphari + fnatic that approached upset and asked about his opinion about alphari. Iam in Germany you can report my post if you want.

hm9pgi7,Padouch1038,11/27/2021,1,55.0,1. Dont try to fight Udyr early he is one of the best 1v1 champs in the game. 2. He has no dash so use it for counter ganks if you get him into your team he has no way of getting out (just flash) 3. In late game if your team has Seryldas you can kite him easily he has nothing to get onto you

hmcenko,Yonaka_Kr,11/27/2021,1,235.0,Still dont understand why most tanks dont go 1 or 2 non-mythic tank items like Thornmail first and then just get a Sunderer or Goredrinker 2nd since the base AD scaling changes makes Goredrinker better on tanks instead of just complaining x tank mythic is worth than y bruiser mythic? If you take dragons fast enough you can see the soul before 2nd full item.
hm9gvmi,-LostInCloud-,11/27/2021,1,389.0,Smurfqueue is not better in that sense. Its still matchmaking its just... Very toxic.  I didnt play ranked at all really for like 2 years so when I played a bit this year I was placed into Bronze II. (Am Platinum player)  Because I was obviously way ahead I was then ... Still matched with silvers and such ... But everyone else was a smurf.  I had games where the max level of the 9 others was like 32.  While I was stomping the games it was so incredibly toxic Id rather not play. And people going afk or griefing is just a coinflip thats hard to overcome. I did not feel I wanted to play a sufficient amount of games to climb out of smurfqueue.   I just went and played Flex when alone DuoQ was the only way to escape smurfqueue.

hmca4bt,TheSoupKitchen,11/27/2021,1,405.0,Im totally okay with them removing or reworking shieldbow I think life-saving shield being so prevalent is a problem for the health of the game. They literally had to add an AP anti-shield item just to combat the power of shielding champions but mostly for the amount of shield items people buy...  Defensive itemization for ADCs is shit though. I always dream of a zhonyas ADC item but I doubt we will ever get something like that and if we do it will just be abused by other roles just like every other ADC item in the game.
hmavtvr,bupropiom,11/27/2021,1,28.0,Ive tried a little bit with AP and I always ended up feeling like a weaker version of tank AD was a bit stronger before they gutted goredrinker.

Farming was shit no team fights could ever happen cause I had 0 bushes to jump to engage/disengage.

hm9soii,quiteUnskilled,11/27/2021,1,131.0,Yea EU in general was strong that year (and KR was weak) but Fnatic went out in quarters that kinda killed their hype. And Fpx did not look as strong in groups they totally ramped up throughout playoffs so Fnatic losing to them in quarters felt a little bit underwhelming.  Also that Nemesis lineup felt a little bit one dimensional iirc mostly because Rekkles and Hyli were so insane that year that everything was about their botlane. G2 on the other hand had something magical about them in 2019 they played arguably the most entertaining and creative LoL of any pro team ever hard to compete with that.

hm9yhk4,SaulJoker,11/27/2021,1,21.0,How do you implement adaptive stat conversion that gives the player the stat they want without letting them choose the stat directly? It doesn’t seem feasible nor reasonable *if you include HP*  Obviously the items aren’t inherently too strong for the champions in an isolated context. If you’re talking about a Mordekaiser buying Frozen Heart and getting 20 extra AP from it instead of the mana and ONLY that then that seems fine right?  The problem arises when you start to look at how those items synergize with other items as well as the champion’s kit. Can you imagine if Mordekaiser could build a cost efficient Liandry + Frozen Heart on top of the items he already buys like Demonic Embrace and Rylai’s? Do you not realize how absurdly broken that would make him?  You’d think Vladimir wouldn’t be a problem until you realize Vladimir can also buy those mana items convert their mana to AP AND HP and suddenly scale even harder than he did before? There’d be no point in dealing with him late game because he’d be a massive stat check.  Have you thought about how ridiculous Rumble’s numbers could get?  No. There’s not enough thought put on the “what happens next” it’s just an idea that seems good on paper but in practice would cause a lot of problems.  EDIT: forgot to add a part to the first paragraph  EDIT 2: Also it’s unfair to compare the previous iteration of Liandry’s to the current because Vlad didn’t build the old morello that gave mana but he does build the new one that doesn’t. Meaning there will always be items that champions gravitate towards regardless of what the items in the game actually are.

hmafxzu,TuxSH,11/27/2021,1,13.0,It scales off your **bonus** mana as opposed to the other two tear items.  You gain **0.5%** of bonus mana as AH before 360 stacks raised to **1.3%** of bonus mana after 360 stacks.  Before 360 Tear stacks it gives about 4.3 AH without a Lost Chapter mythic and 7.3 AH with one despite building from Kindlegem.  You should never start building the item until youre about to have those 360 stacks.

hmcmyh3,wasianpower,11/27/2021,1,106.0,Consider 2 distinct lines on a 2D plane. How many places can they intersect?  They can either intersect once or zero times if they are parallel. If they are parallel they clearly do not form a shape. If they intersect once then they cannot form a closed shape since they must diverge forever after the intersection and thus be “open”.   You can generalize this argument to 3D by thinking about how 3 planes intersect.

hmci5t9,Oreo-and-Fly,11/27/2021,1,108.0,I never said that they cant use it? The item is designed for assassins primarily.   Who the fuck cares that someone else can use it as well? Riots clearly gonna see that and thus adjust the item based off that.   Old moonstones greatest user was TWITCH and BRAND.   Imperial Mandate was a must have on Aurelion with Rylais.  Eclipse was the most broken item in preseason used by everyone.    Guess what happened? They got adjusted to not be as abusive on champions NOT intended for them.   Plus if an MF/Garen/Varus/Xayah get three kills to fully reset their ult they are already winning that teamfight.   So yes karthus could potentially be the best with this item. So riot can just adjust it by idunno removing haste and keeping it a flat AD item so its a dead buy for him statwise.       Also Lethality Varus MF and Xayah are a thing so like they trade atk speed for burst and are shit in team fights in comparison to regular adc... so i dont see how that wasnt even noted by you on your baby rant.

hmdb711,brokerZIP,11/27/2021,1,1.0,The only thing they can show is the time enemy being fully shredded. But its not any useful as well as the amount of armor.

hma2be2,Quirky_Lychee_693,11/27/2021,1,49.0,there is a difference between a losing game and a stomp.  guy i responded to refuses to ff 0-30 games ( fine his choice) and acts smug about it (this makes him an s tier moron)  Also if you dont care about winning wtf  are you doing playing a competitive game?  There are games like stardew valley if you just want to chill.
hma7qsu,pompousrompus,11/27/2021,1,372.0,Yeah that scene is INCREDIBLE. The show is flat out awesome anyway but that is far and away my absolute favorite 90 seconds of if.
hm9baot,TheNephilims,11/27/2021,1,155.0,What I mean is maybe at some point in production Riot could have negotiated a deal with netflix that they will produce this show and it will be streamed exclusively on Netflix or after they produced it they bring it to Netflix and sold them licensing right to stream it. Either way Riot got money from Netflix.  Given the success of the show on Netflix I can see season 2 being stream exclusively on Netflix again.

hmbl8u9,Wrong_Seesaw1567,11/27/2021,1,7746.0,Exactly! I was surprised at first. It seems she doesnt know right from wrong no one would in that state.. I feel deeply sorry for her. When they showed the shot with Claggors goggles on the floor and she just dropped... Not because she was sorry but because she was scared Vi would leave her there. Its not really a normal reaction.

hmb3zuh,LoLrovex,11/27/2021,1,341.0,Well I think you partially answered your own question. You do gotta buy control wards if you want better vision. Aside from that as a split pusher when you hit lvl 9 swap to blue trinket and you can easily play vision on demand.

hmada5l,howtopayherefor,11/27/2021,1,57.0,I think Arcane establishes the new canon. Given its success most people will be more familiar with Arcane lore than LoL lore so future lore will probably adhere to Arcane rather than LoL lore (and LoL lore will eventually become Arcane lore)

hmd43ef,zNiiC,11/27/2021,1,4.0,I believe they also delayed it due to the arcane event skins too. They would have come out with patch 11.23

hmd0was,DruidCrimson,11/27/2021,1,,yeah they are stuck but almost all player rn know that QSS is the best counter for Death Realm when I said that Death Realm is Camilles Ult wannabe it is about zoning capability they are both single target zoning ability but I wish that the Death Realm cant be QSS just like Airborne.
hmcoyw5,Kobear-,11/27/2021,1,57.0,mathematically correct train?
hmb3df1,Chivibro,11/27/2021,1,9.0,Definitely dont need a new account. People cry too much about MMR its nit gonna ruin your climb. Besides if you have low MMR in one account and you havent learned from your mistakes then youll likely get low MMR in the new account.  That also just adds to the smurf problem in League. Just learn more about how the game works and youll play better win more games raise your MMR and climb. Its not so complicated
hmbdkxw,ShadyGecko,11/27/2021,1,42.0,Both should be streaming! Its like pro view but with the comms included.
hmcdf5p,ProtestOCE,11/27/2021,1,75.0,No way LB is deliberately appointed as Guile of Noxus.  She has been trying to kill Swain since he has been trying to eleminate the black rose influence on the leadership of noxus(hence the trifax)  Its one thing if Swain didnt know its LB is quite another if Swain decided to deliberately assign the individual who seeks the end of the trifax to have 1/3 of the vote in the direction noxus takes
hm8uur0,bearugh,11/27/2021,1,18.0,Believe me I feel you but like when your playing week side theres alot you can do to make those opportunities not exist.   Id your getting ganked force them to tower dive and make a risk freeze the wave on your side fake agencie over your lane and situation.
hma7nos,ugandan__chungus,11/27/2021,1,82.0,I do like the dreadlock more but hes most likely not getting a visual update any time soon But i suppose they gonna give him that haircut when they drop season 2 as they will most likely make the arcane skin then.   One thing am hoping for tho is for cntr 5 to toggle on/off his mask. that would be dope
hm9li8y,floodyberry,11/27/2021,1,21.0,good to see NA finally taking things seriously. This is def the year they turn it around
hmbewb8,MoonDawg2,11/27/2021,1,,> Are seriously comparing animation cancels to that shit? Have you ever seen videos of Kayns staying in base and using global Ws to nuke people? Its literally the same principile and its just as gamebreaking since it works with hexflash. This is just redicolous.  One is a global bug that calls for a champ to be disabled and the other is one that riot cant be bothered to fix. And yes animation cancels are likely the most impactful bug in the history of league since the power level of several champs completely depends on it.  > Juggernauts arent supposed to fall off juggernauts are supposed to be durable and hard hitting but slow both in movements and in animations.  Anything that can be kitted is supposed to fall off by late game. Youre a tank who trades cc for damage. Yes you fall off.  > The other day i was playing Mundo 10 cs per minute and i was 100-0 both by Divine Sunder Akali and by a 3 items Kindred when i was full build with tabis and omens. Tankiness isnt a thing after 3 items the only tankiness is oneshotting before you get oneshotted. Something that juggernauts cant do without summoners  I have no idea how you have this issue on mundo since he is the win more jugger atm. Opressively overpowered if ahead and extremely useless if behind  If you have the game please just record this 100-0 situations since this sounds just completely ridiculous

hmcya7a,Mazsi1201,11/27/2021,1,11.0,I dont think you know how the rune works? It is named first strike as it only works when you are the one striking first. The rune is only available if you havent been in champion combat for more than 0.25 seconds when you land your first strike
hm9c652,Raynar7,11/27/2021,1,27.0,How dare you? Everybody knows the moment Tencent buys the company they take over day do day business first and everything else later. They are not doing it just to collect cheques and get game rights for China.  /s

hmd3duy,-Quit,11/27/2021,1,7.0,Bruisers dont build resistance they also dont have MR items and assassins are not able to kill anyone as fast so that the poor ap champs cant use their new builds.  Dont talk about the game if you cant play it.
hma8wpj,XG32,11/27/2021,1,,thats how some would describe upset there are players in other sports thatll play through it he has a right not to but others also dont have to play with him.
hmbnqgv,JohnCornewaille,11/27/2021,1,156.0,Disagreed Sylas isnt even the main character of Demacia since Lux fills that spot much better.   Runeterra works much better when you think of an ensable cast with multiple points of view. And that works with every region having a small number of focused characters on it that participate in various levels of that regions story and moves the various plots along while interacting with minor characters (from the storys perspective) and having personal arcs that makes them grow. Both Arcane and Ruined King are good examples of this (and while the event sucked and there isnt a true canon to it SoL has some of this too).  Ryze while being very important probably will rarely take the main spot on an event outside something with the World Runes.
hm9eq19,HanaShirosaki,11/27/2021,1,163.0,Well done buddy!

hm8ynf7,Zlera-Kilc-odi,11/27/2021,1,199.0,Yes us Talon mains definitely need him to be disabled for the foreseeable future! Im definitely not a salty support main who underestimates the enemy Talon and overestimates my own!
hmchbvq,Raz346,11/27/2021,1,,Right but even then comparing it with other buffing ultimates like Mundo or Olaf it’s still weird
hmaxxjr,_imrahulyadav,11/27/2021,1,84.0,What are those? ARAM and all mid?
hmcgw8d,gothsole,11/27/2021,1,2.0,im guessing its because of how their event queueing system works. during normal gameplay they dont want all the announcements to overlap so the entire voice file needs to play out first so all the extra arcane-themed voice lines after important events will occasionally drag it to a crawl

(idk if its a bug or they simply removed the feature because it was never addressed in patch notes) but when an enemy or minions dropped a spell shard while in vision a star would appear in the minimap and one patch around the time SG Zoe was released they just stopped appearing.

hmc3cb2,Waxburg,11/27/2021,1,8.0,If the support is doing their job or really just people knowing what the 4 key does it should be forcing fiddle to not engage or stall him long enough that fights are either over or objs are taken. Fiddle can carry that is correct but against decent players he becomes lacklustre if his own team cant pick up the slack.

hma195u,delahunt,11/27/2021,1,12378.0,This. League is a specific snapshot of the character but is not tied to the lore in any way aside from vague hints in some modern VOs. Hell a bunch of champions still reference Summoners from the super old lore.  Silco as a support could be a lot of fun. It would also be interesting to see where they snapshot him to get him at his prime.
hmb0frg,markson852,11/27/2021,1,,Like how? He has always been like this in his Damwon days and they won worlds. Normally it should be the team going for the type of player they want to fill into their roster instead of player trying to figure out what type of player the team need.

hm9qcq8,azersub,11/27/2021,1,131.0,First of all how does Nemesis or Selfmade have anything to do with Caps situation when they werent there?  Secondly as i said i didnt blame Rekkles that much for leaving last year cause whole Fnatic looked in turmoil. When Caps leftFnatic were literally in grand finals of the worlds and won 2 consecutive EU splits. Also Fnatic invested in Caps development and he ditched them for biggest rival at first possible monent. He is biggest eu traitor since Zven and Mithy  And sure now Caps and Jankos dont agree with Rekkles on how to play the game but back then Caps was super youn and had no idea how he wants to play so that argument doesnt make much sense either

hmb8hg8,EgonThyPickle,11/27/2021,1,47.0,> and Lyandries makes you wonder why you even bother buying MR in the first place.  MR is really good to build against Liandrys though? Liandrys is an anti-health item its not an anti-MR item. Saying that Liandrys makes you wonder why you bother buying MR is like saying BotRK makes you wonder why you bother buying armor. Both of these statements make absolutely no sense.
hm9x7yx,Shashara,11/27/2021,1,8.0,literally everyone has streaks like that sometimes fair mmr or not.  op has an attitude problem not an mmr problem. if you get this upset over losing you need to stop playing a game where youre *designed* to lose about 50% of the time.  losing 15 out of 20 is not that weird and absolutely not a mark of an unfair mmr. youd lose about 10 out of 20 normally so going 15 out of 20 is perfectly normal its only 5 losses more than what youd get if you always had a perfect 50% winrate... which nobody does.

I think Jinx Ahri Yacuo and Lux are good answers for who are the poster characters for modern Riot. I would add Ashe because I do see her mentioned a lot and also maybe the other members of KDA. Though the individual champions who make up KDA may not be as well-known as Ahri or the real-life singers.
hmac4jh,Exclarius,11/27/2021,1,311.0,> If the situation is calm enough to be sitting back and chilling in arams  This is an assumption youre making. You have no idea (and neither do I) of what he and his family were going through at the time. Like I said in another comment:  > People deal with grief in different ways. Some people want distraction some people want to just spend time on their own some people start hyperfocusing on their passion. If Arams are a distraction and thereby a coping mechanism then who are you to question this?
hmc2uh1,attila954,11/27/2021,1,285.0,He had no scroll he used a staff and he wasnt blue. Until they announce that they plan to rework Ryze into that Im going to say its not Ryze.  A big part of Ryzes character is that he stops FOR NO ONE on his quest for the world runes the only time he did was for Kegan who betrayed him and became Brand. He wouldnt teleport in to save a couple of freezing strangers and teleport them to safety.  Ryze isnt the only mage in Runeterra with rune magic or teleportation its like saying a Demacian soldier with a big sword is Garen even if he looks nothing like him.

About that they could also punish AFK Farmers like that. afk farmers are trolls who just farm the jungle the entire game and recall to avoid fights so you lose 4 vs 5 Riot said itd be hard to detect but if a player isnt participating on damaging either champions or turrets / dragons / rift.. then hes clearly leaving his team to lose.

hmagxzf,bns18js,11/27/2021,1,20.0,Damage is SUPPOSED to be higher than defense late game. This is by design. Games need to end. Damage needs to be high enough so boring stalements dont happen.  This is why tanky characters --- tanks and bruisers are often the strongest champs in the mid game at 1-3 items where their items and high base numbers shine. But fall off during true late game at 4-5 items where ADCs and mages have enough damage to get through them again.  Phreak mentioned this in one of his videos. This is intentional. It serves a purpose.

His frustrations and the other teammates are more than understandable even Upset recognises that hed be fine with having players/orgs not playing with him because of this situation but just speculating and sending hate which Adam KNEW would happen is extremely out of line?! How can you not see that?  Upset wanted to tell Hyli because he trusted him he told Yamato because hes the coach and he trusted him. Again taking DLs analogy if the captain explains you that one of the crew members had to leave because of an urgent family matter you have to trust the captain.  Adam coming out and saying that Upset left because his wife felt lonely is ridiculous who even believes that someone who worked for 5 years to get to worlds would just leave for some stupid reason? Do you think this worlds was more important to Adam who came from EUM just this year than to Upset whos been grinding hard for years and years?

hmb0t02,Bananaeater45,11/27/2021,1,147.0,Because the vocal point if this thread is that somehow nuguri was a major problem in FPX this year which he wasnt.  He was the best top in LPL spring and was the only reason FPX didnt go 0-6. Blaming him for FPXs shortcomings seems irresponsible and disingenious when all of his teammates played like shit the entire tournament.  Me focussing on doinb malz is because a build is the simpliest part of playing a champion. If one decides to first time a champion and does not even do the research of why it is good and simpmy goes i lost scrims to it it must be strong then you are literally playing for fun while being paid millions to actually innovate abd drive the game further something doib did in 2019 which is why they won worlds.

I dont think it really matters if its crow or raven since they both know from the game.  I think during the last episode at the table with Vi Cait and Silco tied up to chairs it was Fiddlesticks because the amount of crows (sorry I dont know the difference between the birds) was huge Fiddlesticks always has flocks of crows around him. Meanwhile Swain would most likely just send 1 scouting Raven which was perhaps when Jinx shot it when returning to their base where was the punching machine and shooting range.  Its funny I didnt notice this during watching the entire show but then I was rewatching the interactions from game and it clicked... Its really cool Detail bravo Riot.

It is not Adams business in the slightest what Upset chooses to share about his family with the team and it is **especially** not his business to post about someone elses private matters on Twitter.  >We know damn well that if given the true reason it would’ve ended up in his post  >We dont.  Seeing as he told everyone what he claims Upset told the team and didnt show any restraint we can reasonably infer that his post wouldve included the true reason.  >Hyli was given the chance to get to know the truth Adam didnt. How would that make you feel when youre 5 humans in the team?  How old are you? Because welcome to the real world. Your close colleagues are not going to share every piece of personal information with you and it is none of your business to inquire about private matters they choose not to share with you but to then air it out on Twitter when you dont get the answer youre looking for.  >If anyone behaved unprofessionally its Upset choosing certain coworkers to know the truth and leave others in the dark.  It is not unprofessional to choose which colleagues you share private information with. He had an obligation to tell Yamato and Dardo which he did. Anyone else he chose to tell is his business and his business alone.

In fact I seem to remember both of them had to be hotfix nerfed because overstacking on Crit was too strong and they abused the fuck out of rageblade.  GP saw changes to make him a worse lanebully and a better scaler I don’t remember Phlox ever mentioning it was because he was underperforming.  Also didn’t Ziggs see some decent buffs to make him viable botlane? I’m actually unsure on that one.

hmay4ms,HarmlessSnack,11/27/2021,1,84.0,Jungle isn’t actually super hard to learn but if you DONT know what your doing and your opponent jungles does know… well they can kinda just win the game.  Jungle influences the whole map and so if your jungler is severely outmatched it can just lose your team so much moral they surrender.  That being said if you watch some YouTube videos and LEARN jungle early you can pick a dominant jungler and win games for your team pretty easily at low ranks.

hmczrkk,runaway1337,11/27/2021,1,31.0,Nothing is ever simple or easy with Riot even when it’s simple and easy.   They used to talk a lot how extremely difficult it was to work on or make a new lobby client. They stopped when people started to see through the bullshit tho.

hma6ioz,seriikai,11/27/2021,1,41.0,If the game rolls hextech drake to be the dragon soul of the game portals will spawn on the map.  Same deal with other drakes altering the terrain.  Infernal removes some bushes walls in the jg.  Ocean adds bushes in jg and river.  Cloud adds a bonus movementspeed zone in the jg.  Mountain adds a rock structure in the jg.  Chemtech adds a camoflauge fog in the jg.

hmaogmp,AureaMediocritas1,11/27/2021,1,8.0,Thats why most Illaoi players are silver 2. since most of them state that.
hmbn7rv,Rengar_Is_Good_kitty,11/27/2021,1,326.0,I find it silly that Riot keeps breaking things that have limits/caps for a reason game is balanced around champions having an attack speed cap or a set  attack range specifically for that champion and several other things wish theyd stop doing that fucks with balance every time causing nerfs/reworks.  With that being said to call it abused by melee is nonsense how about Hail of Blades being abused by ADCs? Double standards huh...  Melees dont have a good option for attack speed theres Hail of Blades which is mostly just an assassin keystone that also happens to be abused by ADCs (See I can do that too) but nothing else nothing wrong with making Lethal Tempo something that melees can use as well as ranged the problem is the way they did it range increase should be completely removed its ridiculous that a Jinx can attack you from across the fucking realm or an Irelia who already has bullshit attack range being able to get it even higher.  It should be an attack speed keystone and nothing else get rid of the stupid attack range and rebalance the attack speed.  Also worth mentioning that Riot has nerfed Conqueror a million times (But still refuses to remove the shitty healing) so its not surprising that Conqueror users are looking for something else to use.  > oposit  Opposite*

hm9enca,Mattiaatje,11/27/2021,1,16.0,Step 1: Dont play Vex support. You only have CC on a 25-16 second cooldown which can be wasted with every basic ability.    Step 2: Teach yourself to level up abilities using ctrl+Q/W/E/R instead of clicking on the +.
hmbj6jb,WildQuantity9355,11/27/2021,1,163.0,I can say in terms of animation quality it can be argued that Arcane is one of the best animations made so far. The cinematography was breathtaking each frame could be a painting. On top of that the way expressions and micro expression were animated. I’m a big fan of Studio Ghibli flims and I can say Arcane’s animation quality rivals Studio Ghibli.
hmcrhlo,AssPork,11/27/2021,1,44.0,Not against current TL and maybe TSM/C9 depending on their final rosters.
hmbpk4j,Araeza,11/27/2021,1,86.0,I really don’t get the people insisting that Arcane “broke canon”.   As far as I’m concerned it’s the definitive version of events and if anything was “broken” it probably wasn’t very well thought out to begin with.   League lore before a couple years ago is honestly unimportant and it literally does not matter at all if something from an old champ bio or article on their fan fiction site conflicts with what something like Arcane Ruined King or even LoR sets up because in my book those take precedence over any other sources of lore until the MMO comes out.
hm9ufw0,rimidalv25,11/27/2021,1,1540.0,what are her animation cancels
hma7x1z,Saiko97,11/27/2021,1,6.0,I like Kog. Unfortunately hes only viable with the right support (Yuumi Lulu) and with a beefy frontline. Otherwise hes too slow and squishy and is one of the easisest champs to kill in the game.

hmayd1t,Baazz_UK,11/27/2021,1,170.0,I agree with you Yasuo still gets some value out of Conqueror in some matchups over Lethal Tempo but Yone becomes completely unstoppable with it no case that Conq is better for him.
hmao9wg,VisageViolet,11/27/2021,1,1.0,Highly recommend not playing on the PBE if you care about improving or rank. Most of the players on PBE are pretty unskilled and the quality of games is really low.

hmaq0g9,boostedben1,11/27/2021,1,98.0,They arent quiet people FPX is known for being a noisy team. The team has tried to integrate Nuguri you can see that in their stream moments and Nuguri would also talk about the members sometimes on stream. But after Spring it kind of disappeared. Both sides probably gave up on each other but the FPX members tried harder than Nuguri tried. You can see times where Crisp and Tian try talking to him. All the FPX members also would heavily defend Nuguri on stream during Summer when he would get flamed for his performance and his PUBG addiction
hma6h7q,Lifemekhanism,11/27/2021,1,68.0,Never really got the hype behind that guy  Maybe if you have watched more than 5-10 games of whole year (especially 2020) you would understand.
hmb9n3e,Cow_Interesting,11/27/2021,1,411.0,It’s fine that he values his marriage more than he did playing at Worlds. Now teams and his potential teammates should know that as well. If they choose to sign him and play with him they have to be prepared for the possibility he will jump ship again if something happens with his wife.   He will only play this game competitively for a fraction of his life. He hopefully will be married for the rest of it.

Like he played eve before all season and ended up g4 with Silver 1/2 mmr. Quite unlikely he randomly improved to that level within a week playing the same stuff

hm8y15b,ApokalypticKing101,11/27/2021,1,,Nasus Trundle Yorick are some of the best imo but a lot of bruisers with auto resets and that hull breaker item. And a lot of ap champs since ap damage scales super hard on turrets so things like TF and other Lich bane champs.

hmatkkk,markson852,11/27/2021,1,112.0,You cant expect someone to be able to change his personality just because he is getting a 2.8mil pay. He had a history of getting bullied during his childhood and is extremely introvert. One should have expected it would be hard for him to learn a new language and taking the initiative to talk.The team should have done a brief background check on the player(just have someone go through those DWG videos or Nuguris namuwiki) before offering fat check to a player.

hmbije4,RobbinDeBank,11/27/2021,1,88.0,Well I only play Aram now so don’t take my words too seriously. But I really like the new mythics and new tear item for tank. It just opens up a lot more build paths for ryze to go a bit more like a battle mage as he used to be instead of having to rush full damage to nuke the enemy before they nuke you.

hmanjmg,SP3EDI,11/27/2021,1,,you are writing a fanfic about the Team romance Its not something your team needs to know because it not involves someone on the team or someone that works for the org. For such cases are subs on the worlds rules. Hily took it like this not because he was closer to upset then the other 3. Hily was basically bff with Bwipo and was still on upsets side.

hm9qd1f,Phantomx_Destiny,11/27/2021,1,26.0,First of all are you talking about rankednormalsaram or a special event mode? Are you a casual player? Do you play a lot?  This is somewhat important to know because if you tell me you play once every month and your a very casual player and thats how you enjoy playing I think thats fine.  But if you play ranked or draft normals often and never ff a losing game in those 2 modes when its a clear lost and everyone is voting yes its kind of a selfish move when everyone else just wants another fresh match because imo and I think the majority of players would agree playing a fair match where you dont know the outcome is the most fun.  But hey if you always want to stretch a 100% losing game in ranked/draft normals 5-15 more minutes and you find that fun more power to you just realize its selfish and the majority of players dont like it.

If you commit to dragon they can just walk over and knock down mid turrets die very fast at that point. And vice versa. That’s a play that happens a ton in games because trading objectives is how the game plays out when you aren’t strong enough to contest them.  Also if your ahead you **always** should commit to dragon otherwise you’re going to have a very hard time closing out the game before they scale up to you over time. Again the enemy team can grab the objective bounty while you are

hma5dqo,catseye013,11/27/2021,1,29.0,None of this is true. Competitive gaming isn’t a job. Players and teams may have expectations on Nuguri but unless his contract specifies he needs to actively engage and communicate with his teammates (which literally no contract does say) his job is simply to play league of legends for FPX which he did.  This is always going to be the danger in throwing millions on players to make them join you entirely for a paycheck. We saw the same thing with SwordArt Perkz and Alphari in NA this year. Like 15 million dollars down the drain for almost no results at all.  If Nuguri logged out mentally because he cared about nothing but the money I agree that’s a shitty mindset and a bad attitude for him. But it was never his job to communicate or act a certain way he was just paid money to play in the LPL for FPX which he did.

Its guaranteed in teamfights and in bot lane all ins half of bot all ins are just trades that they commit to anyway.  Ive only played Jinx with LT a few games and it makes a verifiable difference each game getting kills just on the tip of the extra range mostly. In teamfights it mainly allows the extra buffer for safety and a lot of people arent confident on engaging/disengaging properly when +100 range is thrown into the mix.
hmaj73v,Arraysion,11/27/2021,1,20.0,Resistances matter if you are ahead or if youre tanking. Otherwise yes it makes sense for resistances to not really matter when you just buy one defensive item on a squishy champion.  Also its really disingenuous to say that Zhonyas and Banshees are bad items due to their raw stats since their item effects are extremely powerful and at least in the case of Zhonyas have warped metas for years.

hmarbiq,tanezuki,11/27/2021,1,85.0,>mortal reminder only applies the 60% if you hit them with the three autos.  Since midgame to lategame its still applied very fast. Unless the ADC is a Runaan user it will indeed be mono target.   But you usually dont care focusing down one target is more of a strategy than focusing multiple foes at once. Unless youre playing against a Soraka but she now cleanses GW with her ult so its irelevant.   And idk about the 50% threshold. Tanks may not be able to put them below it themselves but in a teamfight setting would it matter ? Their backline is supposedly dealing the needed damages.   The passive aspect I agree but then either slows makes it too strong or this would make it too passive.   Or put the slow but cap it with a cooldown ? Theres no easy answer I guess.

hmc7e0r,Excalidorito,11/27/2021,1,406.0,The 100 range is far more of a “win more” type thing. Good for chasing down feeling opponents not so good when behind trying to kite backwards.  Not to mention the 30% attack speed isn’t even what a lvl1 S11 Lethal Tempo gave you which was 40%. I think most ADC mains would prefer more attack speed in a trade off of lower range or no bonus range at all.

hmd4g2n,DangerousSeaweed0,11/27/2021,1,569.0,u realize were already doing that kind of things in curent day an age ? US - the land of the free is actually notorious for that.  If police officers ever have to take down an armed suspect that is considered dangerous  they will shoot to kill as well. In ideal conditions  ud obviously want to take them peacefully  but if they decide to shoot back ? those suspects are probably going down.  Now lets think magic. Unlike wepons  magic can do a whole lot more  so its extremely hard to predict. Any given mage could decide to teleport away if he sees u comming  or could decide to throw a fireball at you  which is way more devastating then a bullet.  The simple reality is that non mages dont have a lot of options. I know that in sylass story  magehunters kill a little girl who decide to fight back  but try to think about it : if you have to fight an unstable human that cant be reasoned with that can probably incinerate your entirely squad   do u care about the age anymore ?   As for the petricide potions mages are made to drink......well  we also chemically castrate sex offenders  dont we ?   As for in lore examples :   heimer himself said  magic is dangerous. Even in ryzes cinematic  weve saw that power is addictive  and he - a presumebly trained mage with years of experience still has a hard time letting go.   Annie literally kills her entire family because she cant control her powers.    Weve even had rune wars with massive distruction caused by magic.A vast majority of examples of magic use in lore ended up in tragedy. I have no doubt in my mind that sylas is pretty much an lunatic with an hero complex  given too much power

hma30c8,howtopayherefor,11/27/2021,1,,>How do you implement adaptive stat conversion that gives the player the stat they want without letting them choose the stat directly? It doesn’t seem feasible nor reasonable if you include HP  You know by only counting a % of bonus HP. Roughly 13% should do the trick. Maybe 20%.  >Can you imagine if Mordekaiser could build a cost efficient Liandry + Frozen Heart  Its not gold efficient: I used a 50% conversion rate. Frozen Heart has 560 gold worth of mana on Mordekaiser that would only be 280 gold to be converted into HP or AP. His stats with Liandrys would be worse than with a AP+HP mage mythic.  Liandrys (or other AP+mana mythics) on Vlad would give him \~150 HP instead of 600 mana (+5 AP from his passive). Thats half of what the other AP+HP mythics give him (300 HP -> +10 AP). He would actually scale worse. If Liandrys gave him AP hed get 19.3 AP -> 30 extra HP from his passive. Broken?  Tell me how ridiculous Rumbles numbers would get. If hes not buying Frozen Heart or Zekes the only difference would be that he can buy a mana mythic that gives him 19.3 AP rather than a non-mana mythic that provides 300 HP. How is that game breaking?  Did you put any thought into this? You keep saying imagine how broken X would be if they got... but when I calculate how that would work in practice its actually not at all broken. The conversions are really gold inefficient but those items are still just good enough to be worth considering.

hm9d26l,Kastamera,11/27/2021,1,158.0,>So they would have hit it but just didn’t play  Isnt not hitting a rank because people dont play enough the normal though?  I remember back in season 4 my diamond 2 friend told me that getting to diamond is really easy and anyone could do it if they played enough. At that point its just about putting in countless games and anyone can achieve diamond. So based on that people who arent diamond+ just dont play enough. And I agree with that my experience also supports that.  I never played much ranked (5-10% of games are ranked at max 70% are ARAM) but in season 9 when I thought Id give ranked a serious try I got from silver 2 to plat 4 in less than 80 games with a 65% win rate (so I couldve climbed further easily I was constantly getting matched with p1 players) when my previous peak was gold 4.  And in no way do I consider myself good. I know I suck at the game I know theres a lot of room for improvement but ultimately anyone can reach high ranks if they dont troll and play enough. If an ARAM main can do it anyone can.  >they give some excuse talking about ranked anxiety when really they just wanted attention lol  About ranked anxiety: Ive had that because in ranked games I literally cant even enjoy the game because the one thing that matters is the outcome. Thats why I main ARAM because there the outcome of the game doesnt matter its all for just fun no stress.I remember back when I was climbing in ranked I would only play if I felt like I was in perfect mental and physical condition. Only slept 7 hours at night? I wont be playing ranked today. Do I feel even slightly tired after my previous ranked game? Ill continue playing tomorrow. Is there something distracting me? No ranked until the distraction is gone. Did a teammate tilt me? Im done for today. Did I lose a game?I was genuinely so stressed about playing ranked that I would only play when I felt completely rested and I wouldnt play if I had even the smallest issue.  My point is: the they would have hit it they just didnt play enough applies to everyone below diamond who genuinely tries to win ranked games and climb.And ranked anxiety is a real thing. In my case it increased my win rate because I was only playing when I felt in top form but at the same time I didnt enjoy the ranked games because they were sweat fests and gave me the same feeling/stress as exams did back in University. I even felt bad after winning 2 games and losing 1 despite my LP gains being around 25-28 per game and the loss being between 13 and 15. I knew I was climbing but it still felt miserable to lose because I wasnt getting any enjoyment out of the games and it was only the negativity that really came through. Its the reason I havent played Summoners Rift this entire year and I only ever play ARAM. Its just pure gameplay with 0 pressure.  I know that vast majority of the playerbase prefers being competitive but I just thought Id show you the other side of the coin where some casual players actually struggle with ranked anxiety and perhaps its more stressful for them to play \~100 games than it is for the average player to play \~1000 games. Despite what you said pushing through ranked anxiety is also huge effort and you shouldnt attack/call out people for having anxiety about something.

hmcl2to,klartraume,11/27/2021,1,14.0,Err... no. The entire purpose of this sale is to encourage people to buy the OG skin that wouldnt otherwise. Plus you can always buy it after you get the skin The BE shop cycles the chromas half are available every other time.   The event chromas are tied to summoner icons which makes them a bit of a fortunate exception.
hmaazbf,gnfsp,11/27/2021,1,313.0,Him and his family were already made up. He had been seeing them again for several years.  He was kicked out of his house a little over 10 years ago. https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/izt4n/hi_im_doublelift_formerly_of_team_eg_and_today_i/  8 years ago Travis posted this video https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RUGFOMUnFdg  3 years ago was when the tragedy happened.  I dont think its fair to downplay his situation by saying he had a tense relationship with his family he made made many comments throughout the years about them and it was rough at first but they were on the mend and working it out.
hma6nc3,fojek17,11/27/2021,1,47.0,No. Im saying that arguing over who is in the right whether to pass a surrender vote is lacking empathy.   You need at least 4 people to FF if it doesnt pass then just deal with it instead of making a post on reddit on how feeders should have no say in surrender vote.  Im a never FF guy and yes I might get angry at a surrender vote getting passed in a game that I felt was winnable but I respect the other 4 people who wanted to vote for yes and just move on with my life instead of creating posts online on why surrender vote should be removed from the game.

hmboiyu,Blue_Seraph,11/27/2021,1,326.0,Nobody ever remembers any season as ADC season because virtually every season is ADC season.   Even Ardent Meta and Tank Meta where people would frequently play protect the ADC comps are not referred to as ADC season even when the Marksman was definitely regarded as the most important member in the team.  Even the whole ADC 2k18 fiasco when some non-marksmen started getting some action in botlane happened as a result of ADCs being super overbearing during season 5 6 and 7.   Yeah we all remember the infamous clip of Draven hopelessly whacking at Poppy but lets not forget that people had also been complaining about Marksmen doing burst per second at the same time.
hmaags1,Coolestdude123,11/27/2021,1,311.0,Upsets actions cost Nisqy/Adam probably something like $250k++ each or something. They looked bad at worlds and now their earnings will be lower as worlds showings matter the most (see Hans). And they had no chance to look good because of Upset bailing on them with no reason given.

hm8v5vz,yawnbaby,11/27/2021,1,50.0,Im sorry if I came off as attacking you but youre wrong about my motives. That wasnt my intention at all. I know what you think I am and that isnt me.   But I dont have to prove myself to a random redditor.  Right from the get-go you have created a conception of who you think I am and regardless of what was said stuck with that idea. The main POINT of my first comment to you was not to attack you not to put words in your mouth not to bash you for your opinions. It was to show you what I found and hear your thoughts on why you believe Arcane ruined Jinx in the first place. Yes the sentence containing the word hate was a mistake on my part and could definitely have been worded better however that is something I acknowledged and explained and it is something that couldnt have been further from the point being made.  Only I know my true motives and my true intentions. Again if I came off as someone trying to put words in your mouth I apologize. I truly have zero intention of attacking you and I feel like Ive repeated that time and time again. If you still cant see that and youre still stuck behind this pessimistic notion of me you created then godspeed.

hmb3xqd,afito,11/27/2021,1,91.0,Because it gives you extra damage against people with more hp?`  Other drakes give stats that are absolutely better or worse depending on your role but chemtech gives a ton for carries and by design intentionally puts tanks at a huge disadvantage. Like with infernal you can say carries gain a lot but tanks gain very little fair but in this case tanks gain nothing except getting shredded a whole lot faster.

hmbin2k,Tear-Sensitive,11/27/2021,1,18.0,Sorry to hear about this. Ive played league 11 years now and I can say the toxicity is definitely the core problem with the community (check out voyboys old YouTube video here:https://youtu.be/KpTnmyECT4s).  Even though he is referring to ranked soloq it feels like this applies more to normal queues if anything. I dont blame you for leaving. I havent touched the game really in a few weeks regardless of ult spellboook being my favorite mode
hma2y8j,hobble_wobble,11/27/2021,1,28.0,It’s on EDG’s Youtube channel sorry it’s hard to find because they have so many videos lol but you can try searching among the videos that were posted around the start of the year.   But in summary IIRC: Aaron (EDG’s manager) explained how they formed this season’s roster — Firstly they wanted to build it around Meiko so they had to convince him to renew his contract which was tough since they’ve been underperforming and Meiko received offers from basically every team that needed a support.  Once Meiko agreed to stay next on the list was Scout/Flandre who joined (can’t remember the order) with Scout renewing only if Meiko renews. Next was Jiejie.   The last player needed was an ADC who has a huge carry potential as Scout expressed that he was stressed with the carry role. So with 4 pretty solid players already locked in EDG knew they could try convincing a star player to join and Scout went to talk to Viper who was looking to join a team.

After 2 years and a half Larssen is still absolutely incapable of teamfighting. Which is weird because as VTO would put it The hard part is laning even my grandma could teamfight well. But no if the game goes past 20 minutes Larssen is going to be absolutely invisible.  Hans Sama and Inspired were the two players who could actually create play around the map which was Rogues main weakness. Now Rogue sold the 2 players that helped them get a gameplan and got themselves a jungler that probably doesnt speak english fluently and an extremely unimpressive ADC.   This Rogue team is just absolutely full of players incapable of carrying. I 100% believe theyre going to be a benchmark and nothing more. If you can lane against Odo/Larssen congratulations youve beaten Rogue.

hm9bnq3,NattyGainz,11/27/2021,1,158.0,Sure but what I mean is easy wins are a bit useless. Because if you didn’t earn them you’re gonna drop down back anyways.   Same with this OP. He says he has improved a lot in these last few days/weeks. Sure it’s possible. Different approach can mean a lot. But you also gonna be real how much did he really improve?  Having easier opponents easier games might give you the illusion that you’re getting better and playing better. But that’s just because the challenge isn’t there.   I’ve hd games as well were I felt like I out macrod and out played the enemy as well and thought if I could keep this up I’d reach Diamond. But if an high elo player would review my game he’d probably gasp at how many mistakes I made.

hm950rp,Amsement,11/27/2021,1,199.0,Because stats dont mean everything? If you watched Jensens play overall this year and think hes worth the buyout + salary he probably wants thats your prerogative but it seems most teams dont think that way and seemingly so do some other people in the scene. TL clearly doesnt think Jensen is worth it over a player that hasnt played for a full year.   No one is doubting that Jensen is good enough to be in LCS and I would gander that the reason he isnt playing is because he wants a salary that teams dont want to pay not because they dont think hes good. I wouldnt say teams are sleeping for not wanting to spend a shit ton for Jensen and simultaneously help stuff TLs pockets even more.

The kid Silco tested it on   Though I can agree that the Shimmer wouldn’t have really change what Jinx did because she was already crazy beforehand. It was just there to show the audience that shes now officially Jinx as well as with the chair and the things in her head. Just storytelling. But if youre saying Jinx isnt a result of Powders PTSD then youre just wrong. 1000% Powder wouldve turned out normal if she still had her mom Vander and Vi.  Yes I know Jinxs freak-out-moments are cliche of a crazy person but you cant expect that much realism with PTSD from an animated fantasy
hmbks4z,masterluke05,11/27/2021,1,,What a disingenuous response. Serpents Fang gives 2 more Lethality (barely anything) while having no Ability Haste and a situational boost against shields. Edge of Night admittedly gives a substantial boost in AD because Pyke passive converts HP to AD but also lacks any Ability Haste. Building the Collector is troll on Pyke because you already have an execute making its passive redundant even though it also has 2 more lethality and crit. Youmuus is the only other available non-mythic lethality item that would maybe make a difference in this situation with its extra 8 lethality and MS passive but still would likely underperform Axiom here as I doubt the small increase in damage/MS would allow Pyke to successfully execute Taric with the initial ult reset. I really feel like the substantial amount of bonus gold generated by Pyke ult is being underestimated here.

hmaii6v,Applepowdersnow,11/27/2021,1,3.0,depends if you wanna pay or not.   an EXP boost can help you lvl up faster so you get the BE faster.
hmbap1c,HiImKostia,11/27/2021,1,125.0,Isnt the passive current % hp so it doesnt change much? Youre doing more damage if the enemy has more % hp than you. Id argue infernal is worse since tanks usually have better base damages.

hmb2h6n,lun533,11/27/2021,1,540.0,Judging his ability to head coach from twitch streams is kind of weird.  Just because the stake is so low in those discussions with viewers. Theres no point in arguing with LS when hes raging unless you are having fun with it. The lack of action at times doesnt mean he has problems with taking it. And he does offer counter points against LS. See what he said when LS talked about how its not worth it to make edu content.     On the other hand you can see he shows the ability in communicating his own points and getting the callers points when they arent elaborated well. So youd think hes capable of getting his points across to his players better than someone like LS  AND you have teams where people are only assertive but fail to get on the same page.

hma3j46,FennecOwO,11/27/2021,1,203.0,Youre not taking your lane matchup into account. Reading the map will let you play out your matchup correctly.  As an example you saw Lee Bot as a Toplaner so you know you roughly have atleast a minute without any jungle intervention. Depending on your matchup you could then setup the lane for an all in or push in the wave for free tempo. If your jungler is there you could setup a dive or try baiting your opponent for a gank.   Their jungler being on the opposite part of the map is just 1 piece of the puzzle to how to play the next minute in advance you need to check where all the other pieces are too (i.e. your junglers position or maybe theres a deep ward bot which you can use to turn a gank around with tp) and understand your matchup. Its not as arbitrary as: I see jungler bot I slowpush.  As a general rule you shouldnt be starting anything aggressive in your lane unless you know your jungler has your side of the map covered see their jungler bot or you can 2v1 them even though sometimes its more nuanced than that.

hm9t0jx,SaulJoker,11/27/2021,1,60.0,So just get Death’s Dance Force of Nature and/or Gargoyle Stoneplate.  Honestly I don’t understand why you seem to have a problem with Thornmail. Juggernauts that lack CC should be building Chempunk if AD. And if you need more resistances overall you get Stoneplate. If you need just physical damage reduction you get Death’s Dance. If you need magical damage reduction you get Force of Nature.  It’s really not that complicated.

hm9zexg,delahunt,11/27/2021,1,12378.0,Watch the end of Episode 3 again then immediately cut to where the guns go off at the end of Episode 9.  They both end with Jinx pleading she is sorry after killing someone she didnt want/mean to kill. Only in that moment Silco doesnt toss Jinx away. He tells her she is perfect. He tells her not to apologize. He accepts her even as she killed him.  As Jinx then goes up with the SMDR she hears two lines from Silco. Well show them. We will show them all. This is exactly what Silco said to her as he held her sobbing at the end of episode 3.  That acceptance basically locked in Jinx. She tells Vi that too. She wanted Vi to love her like Vi did before episode 3 even though she is different. But Vi is a different person now too. Theyre both too different. They cant go back. And for Jinx to survive that means she has to go forward as Jinx the only way she knows how...with a bang.  Hence Heres to the new us.

Realistically there is a large number of champions that could be viewed as the main character just because of how they are written which is kinda cool cause y’know everyone is the main character of their own story and all.

When I was playing I could reach Máster playing jungle in less than 200/300 games. However I would not reach more than Plat4 in any other role but top were I would be stuck in D4 at best. Why? Cause Im not master level at those roles. And if I was playing ADC or mid at master you can bet whatever you want that my wr would be 10-20% due to coinflip.

Its just that those motivational issues are kicking my ass. I think you need to find something youre passionate about too though. Something you would genuinely enjoy doing for a living.

I agree with the rest but this just tells me you have no fucking clue what you are talking about ever. I hate people who are *confidently* incorrect. Tencents owned Riot since forever.

hmafevf,LeglessLegolas_,11/27/2021,1,376.0,> why the fuck would the crewmates also need to know?  To prevent EXACTLY the shit show we are seeing now? If it was a legitimate reason and he shared it with his teammates then it somehow leaked the entire community would be supporting Upset and shitting on the leaker. The fact that hes hiding behind privacy BS to keep the reason from his own teammates makes it very clear that he didnt feel he could justify it to his teammates. Bwipo and Adam clearly arent buying the family emergency thing. While it may have been a family emergency for Upset he clearly knew that not everyone on the team would agree with that description. Hence why he is being so secretive bordering on paranoia. No one was in the hospital or he would have told them my Dad is in the hospital. No one died or he would have told them I have to attend a funeral. Either of those explanations would have been perfectly understandable. But hes hiding behind the vagueness of family emergency for no good reason. His teammates deserve more than that and thats exactly what DL is saying here.

hma62kf,Ahrlin4,11/27/2021,1,58.0,The key thing is whats done with the keyword. An AI could search for every mention of the word Shurima create a word cloud (figuratively speaking) of all words associated with that pull out the ones relating to aesthetic details (like hot sandy desert etc.) and then create a picture based on that. And the picture ends up looking like Shurima.  By comparison if the AI is drawing a picture solely based on the word Shurima with absolutely nothing else going on its essentially just magic.  There are other possibilities of course. As someone else mentioned its possible they have a base picture input to start with (e.g. of Shurima taken from the league wiki or whatever) and then the AI is merely blurring some details and making it look abstracted.

In her old lore Orianna was built specifically to replace her fathers dead daughter iirc

hmcpq5d,floodyberry,11/27/2021,1,45.0,isnt that the same reason they dont take ranked seriously? you know one of the main causes of the region being in the shitter? but yeah lets scream like monkeys to make content for our 12 year old fans
hmck744,ironskillet2,11/27/2021,1,625.0,Should get a makeup artist to make you look like you are from the Netflix show. That style of art/animation is cool

hmae98f,LeFiery,11/27/2021,1,,Well I *think* riot has stated theyre gonna conform more to what the chinese playerbase wants because they are the biggest players of league.   It sucks but business has to boom or theres no business
hmbmg6r,szczur_mysz,11/27/2021,1,,More than tank nerfs I hate the fact that it straight up buffs the most annoying gameplay invented in season 10 which is get low then just press that Goredrinker button. More than nerfing tanks it BUFFS the most broken class right now which are bruisers. Like since season 10 Ive seen more last stand than other to runes not talking about revitalise becoming bruiser rune instead of support rune. And then we give them even more damage beacuse why not. Chemtech drake shouldnt be even added to the game noone would be mad if riot released only 1 new dragon.

hmd1the,yang763328228,11/27/2021,1,218.0,LoL nice try. Doinb stayed in FPX base during spring break rather than going home to his wife so he could company Nuguri. Doinbs wife would always order one extra take out just for Nuguri and she even personally went shopping Korean snacks on Korean street for him. A Cheap person like LWX would even buy nuguri drinks. The whole team treated Nuguri lobster and changed their ID just to welcome him. FPX the management even hired a translator and a Korean chief just for Nuguri just him. When Nuguri felt the training room was too noisy FPX provided him a single room so he could lock himself up and continue to be depressed.   TBH fpx owe him nothing. Nuguri is just fking disgusting and unprofessional.
hmab38y,ADeadMansName,11/27/2021,1,313.0,So DL says he doesnt have to be specific but justify it.   So like a family emergency? Telling them that much? Which he did as we all know this was the justification.

hmaadc7,LegalEmergency,11/27/2021,1,311.0,Upset has the right to keep that info to himself but then he opens up the possibility for negative reactions like Adams when his teammates dont know whats going on.
hmd84a6,Random_Stealth_Ward,11/27/2021,1,12.0,Also many of the users from hydra ended up using goredrinker which in turn means they dont care that much for the omnivamp hydrated gives. Not to mention that hydras active was removed too and basically given to gore

hmc2mt0,SadPiccolo7701,11/27/2021,1,,That make sense..
hmaygcc,SleepyLabrador,11/27/2021,1,4.0,> The dodge penalty is questionable enough due to the omnipresence of players who are supremely unpleasant in low rank play and the numerous accounts higher rank players tend to have  It was NEVER designed to fix that issue. All the people who dodge have multiple accounts that they use for climbing so they can just dodge and cycle through those accounts. Ill admit I dodge A LOT and use 3 accounts for that purpose because otherwise I get pissed off at the game and become unmotivated to play. By dodging I continue to enjoy the game.
hm9eh9k,WintersEnvoy,11/27/2021,1,10.0,Hoping for any serious kind of adc changes is masochism I waited for 3 years since 2018 stormrazor rush meta. Even with new items crit was hard ignored despite still being one of the worst item classes in the game.  Seriously if I were you Id brace for like at best 1-2 % AS per stack buff and even a nerf on the range part because its too good on specific adcs and unimpactful on most others (since its so hard to hit 6 autos for most adcs in current league).  &#x200B  A reasonable change would probably be to make it stack on abilities for ranged champs but not melees (and adjust it accordingly) but thats asking too much of riot conqueror was broken for 2 years flat before riot finally nerfed it before the end of this season and decided that tempo also had to be (very) viable on bruisers which was such a coincidence! Adcs had fervor of battle taken away warlords bloodlust got shafted into fleetfootwork which was nerfed into oblivion and obscurity PTA was good for a few patches before it was nerfed into oblivion because its too powerful on like mostly lucian and tristana and unusable/crutch runes for every other adc. Theres not much left on this role crit is bad LDR is monstriously inefficient most champs in the game can go full dmg + tabi build and negate most adc 3 item builds. Adc champs have some of the worst base stats and health regens get gutted faster than any other role when overtuned and buffed at an astonishingly slow rate when their champs are underpowered.  Even this lategame fantasy some people imagine adcs to be is so horrifically untrue for champs outside of like jinx and kogmaw champs like viktor are vastly more terrifying and impactful. Not that you get to reach late and impact more than 1/5 games anyway.  Actually the most disgusting part about the lack of buffs or how unimpactful they are for adcs is how much people defend it on places like this. Graves was not meta for half a year and he gets +1 ad per level kalista or sivir cant be touched because she was super strong once implying that not every adc in the game has been at some point (given so few champs)... **You just get these unbelievably hypocritical mouthbreathers who say kalista or sivir cant get buffs because of a meta that happened 2-5 years ago yet graves can get one of the biggets buffs the last 3 years even if hes been meta like 7 times since his release.**
hm9o2b0,Kemoyin25,11/27/2021,1,173.0,Fair enough. Thanks for clearing that up! 😀
hmd2f9u,e_zzzz,11/27/2021,1,4.0,It’s always been 2 weeks since they have to put it on pbe first… This time it’s 3 weeks since they have thanksgiving week off. So not sure what you are on

hm9c468,thechemicalbrother,11/27/2021,1,51.0,In game it looks like its until her ankles basically if not longer
hm8y2eb,thrownawayzs,11/27/2021,1,196.0,theres micro and macro level knowledge and gameplay in league. support doesnt have nearly as much in both categories  as other roles. saying its the easiest role isnt wrong but its not particularly accurate.
hm8vctw,Forever_Quitting,11/27/2021,1,6.0,Yea atm I feel his items runes and champ are receiving bans so he might drop the pick rate soon. Agree with the point though
hmd4z7v,KarmaMiracles,11/27/2021,1,6.0,Really? I assumed given its riot theyd atleast have a say?
hmd390w,Dancing_Anatolia,11/27/2021,1,569.0,I mean he mightve if he was actually *in* the movie and the audience cant sweep him under the rug. Theres a reason literally every superhero story has some equivalent of  why doesnt Superman take a 2 second flight to Gotham and end the Batman comicline?   You gotta pair up characters to the right storylines.

hm93zyi,1nc000,11/27/2021,1,11.0,Old Mundo when stridebreaker dash was a thing was one of my favorite champions to play. You’d just walk up to them with R extra ms slow them with stridebreaker and beat them to death since landing cleavers on slowed enemies isn’t hard. I miss those days

hmb44bw,stuffslols,11/27/2021,1,6.0,K. One at a time here:  Axiom: actually fairly balanced. If you build it on anyone but an assasin your trolling especially karthus who cant even use the ad or the lethality. She is decent but he becomes so much squishing to get an extra sheild up every so often that its still not really worth it.  On assasins its fairly strong but hardly anti fun except maybe on noc. You either rush it and lose out on your mythic first or push for it second by which point your at tier 2 ult and the cd is enough that itll be up every fight regardless. Unless you fed enough that you can get 2nd item before tier 2 ult but if that happens you deserve to be super strong.   The only time it really shines is through 2 ults in the dame fight... which were almost certainly already won given that you just killed 3-4 of them already so unless your in the really crazy situation  where its not a 1v2 and you wouldnt win without ult but thats really rare and honestly youd still probably win with a better item like youumus.  New lethal tempo: old lethal tempo sucked. It was bad used by about 6 Champs to fairly low degrees of use (jinx and kayle were basically the only Champs who used it regularly). It is now a good rune with actual uses where it has a niche that makes sense and is workable. Maybe it needs a number tuning but honestly I dont even think it needs that given that just make it so that empowered autos (Jax w yas q etc) dont proc it so they have to auto normally and itd be fine imo.  First strike: not at all nearly as good as klepto and absolutely fine balance wise. I play senna with first strike. I average around 600 gold generated on a average. game 300 on bad 900 on good game. That means that s one of the best users of it in the game (long range poke support whos trying to pick fights as much as possible for souls) its barely giving me more gold than futures market and doing far less damage than other damage runes to boot (PtA usually has 1000 damage on a bad game as senna. By .y math first strike is doing 1200 on a really good game.)  5he only  5hing Ill give you is that Chemtech is pretty powerful... so just nerf it after pre season. Idk make the health tick down faster increase its damage reduction prevent ult usage etc)  Seriously. This pre season has so much potential  if you guys would stop whining lol. Beat mage item weve gotten in a while a great slew of tank item changes to make them considerably better. Its been a good patch dont know why everyones all up in arms.
hma0p8w,OddIndication4,11/27/2021,1,25.0,Hard cringe.
hmad5bz,Both_Requirement_766,11/27/2021,1,101.0,thsts unproven at best. every company has at least the goal to accumulate money. and even I like tencent. but since the great buy-out from 2015 there is a swing. riot gathers fewer modders to produce any customer skins (yes they still produce custom ideas but on a way different route). where you can see it at best is the defenitely-not skins april-fools skins and almost every skinline related at least to xmas got curbed down significantly (same goes for the old winter xmas map never seen again since 2015).  I like the replacement skinlines like bloodmoon or all around moon-fest or new year skins within the asian regions. but like I said 2015 they curbed down a good chunk of skinlines that dont seem to sell so well in the east. its a pity.

Its insane if you can stack it.

hmazf9n,SwirlyBrow,11/27/2021,1,13.0,This is as good a place to ask this what do characters like Darius think of Singed gassing Ionia? I know Noxus has a questionable history but I didnt think they were supposed to be viewed as outright evil. And given how much someone like Darius values power and military might was he on board for Singed using chemical warfare and murdering civilians?
hmcq5hn,falkner97,11/27/2021,1,2.0,i think the problem isnt with the passive   its with the stats   ad + lethality + tons of ability haste is way too much   sure you can argue that champion like shen and ashe are using it but tbf this 2 champion is not actually OP or even close to abusing the item atm

hmd599c,Hannig4n,11/27/2021,1,218.0,The time FPX 3-0d RNG in spring playoffs Nuguri would literally win his lane and then tp bot to save his bot lane who were getting railed by Gala/Ming. Idk why Redditors are now rewriting history to say he got carried when he was in contention for the best player in the world. His team absolutely let him down though.  In summer he slumped and doinb carried the team but Tian was never any good idk why people overrated him so much. But Nuguri turned it back on during worlds when Doinb choked.

Check out the sub and youll see a bunch of it but dont overdo it or itll stop being hilarious when you see it in the wild like this.

hmd7qg5,Random_Stealth_Ward,11/27/2021,1,6.0,Ocean dragon seriously changes how you play a lot more than people give it credit for specially supports. The jungle becomes a survival horror if you are an enchanter but if you are a hooker like Blitzcrank you become the hunter so its fun its like Chemtech but you actually can ward so you see what kills you  Also very fun as Teemo with the new blind duration when playing normals the added bushes just tell you to camp and wait for some unlucky idiot to step on shrooms.
hm9naz0,SaulJoker,11/27/2021,1,6.0,Unrelated but… couldn’t you have just downloaded OBS real quick and recorded it?  This is… uhm hard to watch.

Its all about instant gratification and youre only as good as your most recent result.

hm9fxid,DanteStorme,11/27/2021,1,47.0,Yone Yasuo and Viego all have some part of their kit interact with getting crit thats why they build crit items. The same goes for some juggernauts who can get the full benefit of a tank item in thornmail.  It doesnt mean every juggernaut should build every tank item.
hmaxu07,throwawaynumber116,11/27/2021,1,19.0,Idk. The thing is I know people who did get finally get prime because of this (and the other Amazon/twitch benefits) so I assumed a lot more people did the same thing. Because that was really what I was talking about.  If u just had prime already then of course the rewards are basically free
hmaarkb,SP3EDI,11/27/2021,1,313.0,faker would be the first to be on upsets side on this.   he knows that family is more important then league. he would not even need to think about it.
hm9bhqx,Urlilas,11/27/2021,1,158.0,I didnt play much league for 2/3 years but when I did I was OTP eve (D2~master) and landing W wasnt necessary in late game and I would only use it so instantly slow the enemy and 1 shot him. Basically W is only usefull early to boost damage or late if you fight a tank/bruiser alone. The thing is that early I want to avoid boots as it reduces the burst during a window where Evelynn is already short on damage and late you absolutely dont want your position to be known or them being aware of you so you dont want to use predator. Basically early game you had less damage with predator during a window where you only need damage (except if they drastically changed that). And late game you can trap better without predator.  The only good thing is that if you time predator well you can gap close faster but at the same time if they see the icon above their head they are ready to react so you loose your advantage.  Thats why I dont understand why you would take the rune back then. But the game has changed a lot and if electrocute is nerfed + predator is buffed maybe it is worth.

hmcpdee,Rengar_Is_Good_kitty,11/27/2021,1,255.0,Quite frankly that dragon is a mistake and should be removed it gives every champion camouflage which is already enough to piss the entire community off but also gives old Yorick ultimate which is just silly then theres the passive which just nerfs tanks and is completely unnecessary especially considering tanks arent that great.  Bonus points for it completely fucking Rengar making him borderline unplayable when that dragon is a thing.  **So in conclusion nothing is good about this dragon meaning Riot will never remove it.**
hma92iu,FrequentlyBottomFrag,11/27/2021,1,52.0,Nice arm chair analysis what a fcken psycho. Bruh you dont know if he did that purposefully or not. He was always quiet even in damwon which is why in the beginning of the team him n canyon couldnt play together because neither of them talked. He gave it his best if he was just chilling he wouldnt have taken this year off. Lck players cant afford to take a year off with the military service hanging above their heads

hm9oucb,WrathB,11/27/2021,1,129.0,Crazy that Fnatic 2019 was on simmilar level yet people forget it an LEC team in group with giants like T1 and RNG eliminating Uzi from Worlds and losing to eventual champions FPX 3-1 with actually better score than G2 Fnatic was deffinetely an insane team in 2019
hmd6cel,OutRiteWite,11/27/2021,1,170.0,The problem is there is nothing to really compete in that would be worth it for those players. The LCS doesnt do relegation anymore so its not like they can fight their way up into the pros again anything else would not be worth competing for instead of playing in the LCS.
hm9f8nh,DHSUAUGEV,11/27/2021,1,33.0,Yes and that map is an eyesore and isnt fun to play on.
hmd713h,SpaghettiIssoup,11/27/2021,1,,He did not have a tank item advantage on you he had an ap item advantage on you. Demonic embrace at that point is giving close to if not more than 100 ap on top the dot. With zac’s ratios that is going to kill you. He is giving up tankiness for that but since he caught you out it works out for him. Don’t play it off like he is not building damage when 1) he has the strongest damage dealing tank item to give up on utility (sunfire is terrible into ranged kiting) 2) he literally has an ap item that synergizes really well with his kit 3) he has cdr boots instead of tabis to further add on to his damage. He is taking massive risks for not building actual tank items and if you ever played zac you’d know that with this build you die very fast if you miss e on an engage.  And yes regardless 1 item and 1 level is a massive difference especially when that one level is at 16 when he gets another point in r. If you faced up against another adc with 1 item and 1 level advantage you die no question. Why are you making that a tank issue? You are weaker and you didn’t even play the fight properly you should never win.  Blitz is a pick support if he hits q you should die. Even then he could not solo kill you in a million years. You died because you got hooked into 3 people. You would beat him 1v1 in this game and better yet you should gale force the hook or not get caught by it from out of vision. You seem to have a massive problem positioning. Both of these deaths are more than justified.

hmax05j,realCptFaustas,11/27/2021,1,65.0,If its that close i think soul solves it except maybe cloud one anyway.  As for importance of early and mid game teams worldwide got better at it and focus on it more because game time is intentionally shortened (soul and elder).  And far enough ahead to secure soul and far enough ahead to end the game were not the same with stall and scale comps which are boring to watch and play you should look at it that from the perspective that some champions are bad cause they need gamelength thats no longer there and should be looked at   I have issues with the drake system and new drakes but its not scaling or gameending ability of them.

If riot just reworked tank mythics to have armor heavy and MR heavy versions we would see them in games again. It’s beyond stupid that we have to buy an early null magic mantle against an AD laner just to finish our mythic. Opponent literally gets a 450 gold advantage right off the bat just for not playing a tank

hmcmqxo,RaiseYourDongersOP,11/27/2021,1,442.0,Its not gonna be nerfed just for melee most likely. Even if its fine on range Im used to Riot fucking them over with changes sometimes.

hmb0alw,LoLrovex,11/27/2021,1,341.0,So in s8 I played so much syndra I basically first picked it everygame because I thought the champion was so strong. Even though in comp shes picked a lot Ive felt theres always been better champions in her role as a control mage. Shes only really good for getting prio early but in soloq I would consider her not that good. Obviously if you play well on her shes still a fine champion but a champ like orianna or currently first strike viktor will do her job better.
hm94lg9,Pelax3,11/27/2021,1,332.0,Screw toxicity. Waiting for a diamond game on EUNE takes about 30 minutes. In master/challenger ur playing against same people all the time because no one else is there. Basiclly the EUNE server is a testing ground for champion or a playground for OTPs.

If I were a fed vex that knows her damage and then saw voli bring the fight to a squishy kayle and azir in a choker point I will go in. It’s a misposition and they deserved to be punished. It’s not like they have anything to cancel my combo cus rakan obviously mispositioned too.  The risk is not too high. Youre just playing safe :)

On the other hand atleast Russians arent that big of an issue in EUW(In Dota 2) and US region is full of whiners anyway. Have you seen how toxic it is towards big name players? No wonder US teams have become a meme in that game and only worthwhile team is EG.

hmabaoy,Exclarius,11/27/2021,1,313.0,I cant tell if this is just a joke or an attempt at delegitimizing what I said but if it isnt a joke:  People deal with grief in different ways. Some people want distraction some people want to just spend time on their own some people start hyperfocusing on their passion. If Arams are a distraction and thereby a coping mechanism then who are you to question this?

hma7dac,CanIBeFIREIn10Years,11/27/2021,1,4.0,Tbh I dont have much to tell you as you have done everything you could already. All I would suggest is to find a duo or a team in our LoL discord as there are plenty of people or teams that are looking for someone like you. Good luck and have fun! Cheers!  P/S: What I usually do during a losing streak like this is to take a break for a while and play norms/draft/aram to find some fun from the game instead of getting even more tilted and getting random toxic or troll players. I do it until I feel ready for rank again. This is just my own experience and opinion. I hope it could help.
hm9qo1x,duetschland69,11/27/2021,1,63.0,True. But Zoom has always been good since his debut with JDG. Thats why it shocked me. anyway we will see in spring.
hma1u9j,hiccup333,11/27/2021,1,12378.0,Yeah its like the writers used her illness to make her do whatever they want where ever they want the story to go.  Like she kills Silco BUT she also still stays the villain.  I didnt buy that as an organic thing
hm9xnt2,Kroxxen1,11/27/2021,1,21.0,Maybe try playing a bit less than currently do but still play since it brings you joy! And if you need people to play with there are plenty of discord servers to find people to play that have decent community built I’m in one myself and most of time can find some to play with. Also in comp aspect tryout for a team if you wanna play competitive maybe be a sub or starter if you can. But don’t drop it
hmaxk8r,Silver-Alex,11/27/2021,1,12407.0,Oh yeah her portrayal was pretty realistic for someone with her mental issues going through all she went through and her relationship with Silco was one of the highlights of the show for me. Especially how it ended with Silco saying that he would never sell her or betray her. I loved how he believed and trusted in his crazy daughter until the end. I just simply dislike jinxs as a character but thats a personal bias the writers did an amazing job at this season given what they had to work around.

hm9b9vt,AalfredWilibrordius,11/27/2021,1,42.0,Just accept that for a ton of champions tank item GW just sucks when you only have one ability to proc GW thats kinda bad but when its also a cc thats even worse because you dont really value GW while theyre cced because a lot of the healing can only be used while youre not cced. Unlucky time to not play an old champ because Riot doesnt like those and doesnt do anything about stupid issues that only old champs have to deal with.   Or in this instance beg your enchanter support or someone else to buy GW because they do have good items.
hmbrs1w,Thisissocomplicated,11/27/2021,1,,I mean it would very much suck for the enemy player and be effectively a 4v5 because an aí controlled player isnt really competitive. Way too strong like this I think

hmaub0d,Agreeable_Junket_271,11/27/2021,1,31.0,the issue is that in NA its often the case that the coach has a much worse understanding of the game than the players so this respect doesnt exist like it does in the east at least if doublelift is to be believed. we know the coaching in 2020 tsm was very laissez-faire with DL and Bjergsen making the big decisions

hmce2vz,PropagandaIsUseless,11/27/2021,1,,Play 1 game with normal Zoe and then play 1 game with the Cyber Pop skin. The difference is HUGE. Its like if Morgana or Karma teether visual didnt move with them so you couldnt see when an enemy is about to walk out of range.  Its not just a minor visual bug it makes it way harder to determine where Q will go compared to every other skin (and classic skin) and it has been like that since release.  Getting more visuals when someone is hit in the fog of war is huge too (or just getting more visuals on hit in general).
hm93iug,deliriouskai,11/27/2021,1,253.0,So Ghost was ready as long as the agreed upon salary was equal or more than current? And theres something about T1 in the comments too. Canna wanted his way but T1 already had an agreement with NS before DK came into the picture? I really wish the timeline was clearer lol.  But man I feel so bad for players who get involved in these PR tussles. I cant completely blame the orgs either they have the players under contract so they are thinking about the best way to profit too. Its pretty much a helpless situation for the players. No wonder they have been expressing themselves on social media to let out their frustrations.

hmc6nty,Blue_Seraph,11/27/2021,1,406.0,Still while I disagree with the idea of Galeforce being trash I can see the logic behind it.  You spend long periods of the game with Galeforces active being on CD making the lower combat stats felt. On the other hand  Stridebreakers effective CD being \~ 10-12 seconds at most meant that the stats being subpar mattered a lot less. So I get how could someone defend Gale being trash while still considering old Stride to be broken.

hma3tgo,Cahecher,11/27/2021,1,,Ironically TES won LPL by playing through 369s lane last year and then they started playing towards JL leaving top as the weakside. Basically when 369 got resources he looked really good but this year he wasnt getting much and looked terrible. Considering both 369 and JL are dirty inters when left to their own devices its hard to blame TES for their decision since there was no way this team could field both of them.  The point is that right now 369 is one of the players who can stand to the level of Breathe and Bin and while Zoom is better overall its not like 369 is washed or has no carry potential.
hm96c0k,brokerZIP,11/27/2021,1,38.0,I think you are right. Chainsword is almost useless because you finish exe/bramble as 5th or 6th and building chainsword feels odd compared to thornmail. Because at this stage you have to have resistances because everyone can 2tap you consideering the amount of percentage damage. Chainsword is great as a 2nd Vs some insane healing but delaying your steraks or something like hydra is so shit and puts you behind as well as dumpstering your lead

hm9gqnq,CuriousPipe8558,11/27/2021,1,13.0,I love league and I never minded playing alone when ppl were offline but I could always discord and stuff with friends and we did a lot of flex. But now I’m just really alone on league haha. I did travel a bit to nyc/Vegas with some real life friends from college (making a little >200k/yr and as a fellow gamer you know our only expenditure is computer internet and food) so I have plenty to waste on vacation. But main issue is like having spent like most of the last 8-9 years of my life pretty much only gaming it’s hard to really make convos and feel apart of the group when I’m with people who don’t game/watch anime. I know this is probably my fault for not making more effort since they graciously let me come along but man I just miss my old league friends when we had so many people we would play in houses often. Life will never have as much of a high so I guess I just need to come to terms with it that I will eventually grow up and sadly maybe have to accept friends moving to different things :(

hmcywvt,Rawdream,11/27/2021,1,54.0,Previous year [xiye gave it all to win and you could see he felt bad when they lost the qualification](https://twitter.com/lplenglish/status/1315543345041608706) he was the best player in LGD at WC.  I understand your concern but that wouldnt be the right mentality the 4th seed thing see the example of EDG. On the other extreme the bad attitude Nuguri had this year that took him nowhere. What they should think its getting motivated to fix what it didnt work.  It was Bo1s its a volatile format thats why Riot like this format. LNG could have made it their own mistakes was part of the reason why they lost they finally understood the meta during the tiebreaker while in one of their previous losses they didnt care about vision control which was an important part of the meta then they got flanked. Thats one reason why its interesting to see what happened there.
hmbo4y2,Rengar_Is_Good_kitty,11/27/2021,1,326.0,This is only half true ADC items are strong as hell but they are not mediocre on ADCs theyre really good just that theyre fucked on the melees that use them.  They could do the reverse and make them weaker on melee champions but I think they just need a straight up nerf especially Immortal Shieldbow the shield is absurd and gives you health and sustain on top of that? Thats a bit much for a defensive item makes squishy champions unkillable a lot of the times.
hm9xzsj,montlogan,11/27/2021,1,16.0,Every role is equally as impactful. As adc you can carry by positioning right and not feeding in lane. As support you can carry by roaming and getting vision. As top lane you can carry by map pressure and utilizing teleport effectively. As jungle you can carry by map pressure and effective counter ganks/counter jungling (counter ganks are WAY more important than actual ganks because you prevent deaths and get kills in the process). As mid lane you can carry by map pressure and getting fed. IMO mid is the hardest lane to carry because your playing against a bunch of egotistical people who think they can 1v9 every single game (at least in plat and diamond minus lux mains who afk every game). Mid mains are the worst they all think they’re 6 tiers better than they actually are and tend to rage the most.
hmd8iht,edgelordweeb_,11/27/2021,1,170.0,Its true though it has been like two years since Doublelift last played pro and he was looking washed then. Why would he all of a sudden be a top tier adc now? As for Sven he was just in LCS and he was terrible. Why would he all of a sudden become good by joining a worse roster than the one he was on before? Solo has never really been anything impressive just a decent enough LCS level role player. Assuming were calling bottom tier bottom three what three players in LCS would any of these players be better than in their role?

You have no defensive items at that point so you should absolutely get blown over by a strong wind given how late game it is. Whether hes a tank or a bruiser  or anyone else.
hmcxrvt,Yashimasta,11/27/2021,1,2.0,Thanks! I was just thinking how rare it is for Supports to get to 16 and it would be cool to get some sort of bonus for making it to 16.

Might be tame by todays standards but he was a monster. 1v5 pentas.  Then I imagine if launch Samira time traveled back to be the first season 1 champion.  I also remember Leblanc getting hot fix nerfed for killing people with q+r+q+ignite - first champ to get the treatment.
hm9evwm,Shadowstep_kick,11/27/2021,1,48.0,I dont care what the best player is doing my silver strat is better  Homie just cause youre playing some garbo strat for 3 years and then it gets buffed and picked in pro play doesnt make you a messiah.

The video shows a competitor prioritizing his personal life over whatever sports/competition theyre engaged in and the coach agreeing. The fact that the competitor agree to divulge the info has nothing to do with it.  Imagine if the guy just chose to only let the coach know (because its his right to make it public or not that he became a father)? Yep you got it the coach would still agree with him mature ppl who dont know would accept it and idiotic journalists and spectators would go after him exactly like you and Adam do.

They made her W scale with crit and it made for [some great content for Vandiril.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQgZ4vw9xM4) And then there was also this Galio q buff where they made the health percentage scaling super high and then he could [oneshot tanks with Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMg7ZEV5x5I).
hmaxuos,MoonDawg2,11/27/2021,1,170.0,> Galeforce is perfectly fineits just slightly more situational in comparison to Kraken  I cant really think of any reason to use galeforce over kraken unless youre Lucian or Jhin. Maybe forgetting some irrelevant adc somewhere. Think twitch can use it?  > Literally any semi on hit based ADC can viable use iteven if theres not a gigantic AP threat in the enemy team  Yeah apart from on-hit adc its usually a bad item. That being said I think its honestly fine to have an item like that.  > It works fine on a plethora of ADCs like ApheliosKalista and Dravenbut is simply more situational in the same vein as Galeforce   Forgot aphelios and kalista actually. One I just dont play and the other is a bit irrelevant currently. Draven is perma-banned on masters+ where I usually play so honestly forgot about him too.  The tldr on shieldbow is that its actually shit unless you have some ridiculous damage on abilities. Its an aggro item not defensive which is a bit stupid.  > The item is quite literally one of the strongest second items in terms of damage and has an insane scaling to boot.  And it still has a lower winrate on every slot except for 4th or 5th. Really the item heavily suffers from buildpath and once finished it needs more items to scale correctly

It was someone understood back in the early seasons that going 0-3 is not bad as long as you keep in cs and in xp.

Much in the same way that for example if even on turrets and dragons but a teams support has the kills (for whatever reason) it would feel bad for bounties to go to the other team because then their carries benefit whereas our gold lead goes into a person that is not meant to carry.  Ive seen games where a Jungle Yi pops off rest of his team is bad but then they get the bounties which makes it FEEL worse. The metrics or logic they use to determine who gets bounties and WHEN has to be looked at.

I dont know Adam or Bwipo or Hyli or Upset personally so I cant say if they would understand or support him. Do you know any of them?    Upset who does know them personally decided that some of them arent trustworthy enough and I cant argue with that because again I have never spoken to any of these dudes     And again you dont know what happened. All of these points can for example point to his wife suffering from depression but also a difficult pregnancy ending in a miscarriage or somebody from her family dying after a longer sickness.   All od which are valid reasons why Upset would choose being with her over worlds      As for Adam saying she just felt lonely Upset called that a lie. Why would I trust Adam over Upset?     Also the fact that you just bring it down to his wifes  feelings shows you just dont have a life experience and/or empathy to get why would her being severly depressed be enough of a reason to go back   Like I said I hope you just mature one day rather than learn from your own experience
hmad6po,Haramwey,11/27/2021,1,310.0,Upset won’t say what it was because it wasn’t actually a big deal.   Upset is a 21 year old who married a camwhore he knew for a couple months. She made a fuss when he went to Iceland and he rushed home out of fear she was banging his neighbors.

hmag0ah,Fictitious1267,11/27/2021,1,44.0,Games like this trick your brain into thinking youre accomplishing things with your life. MMOs do this as well or any game with a ranking system or achievements. The normal human being has a craving for accomplishments involving improving their life like becoming proficient in music working on a business tilling their land etc. LOL hijacks that desire for self improvement and puts it towards something that has no meaningful benefit to your life.  I think thats important to keep into perspective when playing the game. You can play but dont give rank too much meaning. Work towards meaning in your own life with tangible things.  Never argue in game. People just weaponize it because they know Riot is a bunch of idiots that ban for words over actions. Mute everyone and play how you like.

hmdajxq,comeondude55,11/27/2021,1,170.0,I honestly doubt Kenvi’s buyout was massive I think he’s overvalued by reddit he was the best academy jungler don’t get me wrong but his buyout could be like 3 mcchickens and a team would opt to get contractz/nxi instead and save themselves the mcchickens. But even with this teams just don’t care for natives
hmaqbfa,the_w6rst_,11/27/2021,1,40.0,My big issue with Chemtech is the fact that you can use summoner and ultimates. Late game if you win a fight against a team with Chemtech soul they can still flash on your carries and kill them no problem. It seems like theres not way to stop it and its auto loss.

hm99hin,AlaanaBanana,11/27/2021,1,6.0,I would say in this case mid lane. The simple answer is if you are skilled that role has the most agency in the game because.. it is in the middle of the map. You can: play lane to manipulate into shoving or freezing for macro you can invade or defend their/your jungle typically the quickest you can roam to bottom lane or rotate to either objective pretty easily. And lastly you can roam top lane.  Okay that last one was a joke. But not only for these reasons of agency you will also work the most with other lanes to get to know the overall game macro quicker than playing either side lane. Of course jungle is similar for the same reasons but I would still lean towards mid because of minion manipulate.

hmd8vi9,edgelordweeb_,11/27/2021,1,170.0,Im thinking that you cant judge the current skill of players based on past achievements. There is literally 0 basis to believe that Doublelift after two years of retirement due to him being washed would suddenly come back and be a great adc and better than even half the current LCS adcs. I also dont see any reason to believe Sven would suddenly stop being trash. He sucked last split so its safe to assume based on his most recent showing that he still sucks. He hasnt shown anything since to indicate he doesnt. Solo is just mid. Idk what you want from that really. Hes an alright role playing top laner who maybe should be on a team rn. Either way hes old as fuck and teams are prob more interested in trying out younger talents. You might have a stronger baseline performance with Solo but hes a known quantity and for a lower tier team its best they operate on the idea that if theyre not contending they should be saving/developing to become contenders in the future i.e. not paying more for older stagnant talent and instead focusing on trying to scout and develop younger talent.

hmbk52n,ARMIsNOTLoaded,11/27/2021,1,365.0,That is the reason why if you want to play support in low elo just pick an AP carry mage (or Pyke/Panth) and 1vs9. If you want to play something team-reliant like an enchanter/engager you have to pray your team is competent enough to finalize the plays you can set up for them.  Traditional supports multiply the efficiency of their team. If you are 100 but your team is zero 100 \* 0 = 0.  In higher elos this goes the opposite since traditional supports brings much more stuff on the table than AP carries and their chances to have a competent team around them are way higher.

hm9gc6s,Prestonwww,11/27/2021,1,17.0,Im sorry that was your first experience with the game. Thats why I would always recommend every brand new player to play at least a couple AI games before jumping into PVP. Yes the AI games suck ass. You really wont learn much aside from the basics. But considering I jumped into the game playing sivir mid duo playing a couple AI games certainly would have benefitted me very much had I known. The important thing is that you tried to make people happy and personally I was never happy in any role. I just focused too much on my teammates faults and could never improve upon my own because of that     Im glad that you eventually found a group that you worked well with. And I agree once you find that one group everything just works. But they are so few and far between that more often than not you just get the same level of tilt if not more than usual.
hmbqsbe,Salmon-Boy,11/27/2021,1,170.0,>theres no skill played in that at all  It takes quite a bit of skill to obtain a dragon soul in the first place. If it wasnt that hard why didnt you take it?

hmbimre,Alex_Wizard,11/27/2021,1,5.0,Shaco tends to be stronger in the early and mid game than he is late. Average game length has increased because of the new bounty system so early game focused champions are slightly weaker in the current meta. One mistake by the winning team in the mid game can result in the enemy team catching up negating any early leads Shaco builds.   There are also a few new rune and item adjustments that have indirectly buffed other champions and make it harder for Shaco to do his job. For example Viktor has sharply increased in win rate and primarily runs Crown. Since a big portion of Shaco’s damage is front loaded he has less opportunities to make plays in his games. To my knowledge Shaco isn’t really a prominent user of any of the new runes or items so he was indirectly nerfed from them.

hm9dqz1,MrDrugnut,11/27/2021,1,30.0,Toxicity comes when you are being the 1 vote that causes the early surrender to fail. Dont be that guy.  What do you play for? Im sorry do you consider inevitable defeat fun? No I dont enjoy watching grey screens on loop. Again I dont think anyone is asking you to go next if the game is relatively even. If it happens at 1-0 its either a joke or a real troll. But once a snowball is in motion once all lane prios are lost and you are 2-3 dragons behind and you cant overstep anywhere without dying asap... its time to go. If bot lane is looking like a 600 gold objective for mid and jungle then its time to go.

hm90mwx,AlbertoTyp,11/27/2021,1,67.0,For a character like Poppy you make her slightly larger than canon and animate her in a way where she holds her hammer up straight. Then itd be similar to [Charlotta from Granblue Fantasy Versus](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/OblongCourageousAnhinga-max-1mb.gif) where her crown acts as part of her body that can be hit. I think this approach would work for some yordles.

hmeq0hc,adamcmorrison,11/28/2021,1,6.0,If you are new to league you are playing in an MMR bracket that would allow you to literally play anything you want mid with some level of success. Focus more on playing a few champs you want to play regardless of matchups. Then as you start to notice trends based on those matchups you’ll learn what works for you against who.   What’s not good is just blindly following matchup guides online. For example if you are playing Kassadin and online it says never play kass into X champ. So you follow that and literally never see and feel the matchup. There is a very good possibility you could win that match up and especially so as you get better at Kass. But if you just do what things online tell you you won’t learn like you should.   Of course  some matchups are close to unplayable but the human factor and skill levels still play a huge roll.   Long story short work on you and your skill and focus less on the meta data.
hmevd5m,Dyrreah,11/28/2021,1,338.0,Exactly. Sett is not human but maybe let Vi keep her gauntlets to even the odds a bit. Also tell her to actually dodge for once in her life and she might have a better chance.
hmetpqb,SG_Taliyah,11/28/2021,1,352.0,Basically its not that simple. What i replied to implies that if they didnt add two drakes they wouldve made a map skin. Thats probably furthest from the truth.      Its just not worth their time and money.      Also its only an incredibly small part of the player base that actually cares about the winter map. A lot of people hate it. And if you want to reskin a map to  endear the player base you would make a Spirit blossom or Lunar new year map. Not everyone is a white christian.

hme3ooi,yasiqu,11/28/2021,1,,just keep doing it then you wont get a support like that every game. there still are situations where you dont want to freeze say you would take too much damage from it you want to recall or the enemy botlane just roamed across the entire map but if its a good situation just keep being confident about your decision and if your support really doesnt want to try to play accordingly.

hmel7yj,acdxfgb,11/28/2021,1,3.0,Well tahm is not considered a support anymore people hate when I play yuumi and janna is just so nerfed its not fun anymore. out of the 4 other roles im the worst at jungle. I forgot to mention my elo but I reached gold 2 with less than 40 games but I gave up since playing support isnt really fun anymore.
hmetkmf,KablamoBoom,11/28/2021,1,748.0,Damn I remember when this cinematic came out. Honestly it holds up really well graphics aside.
hmeq2fs,SuperSpaceGaming,11/28/2021,1,91.0,I also thought that at first but the N and X seem too perfect for it to be a coincidence

hmex0f8,Talonoscopy,11/28/2021,1,106.0,Id walk into that.
hmeydr3,Quazifuji,11/28/2021,1,,I think Swain would also be an obvious major character in a Noxus show too.  Honestly I feel like the tricky part of a Noxus/Ionia show would just be the number of characters that feel like they should have the spotlight.  But there are tons of Piltover and Zaun champs and they still made Arcane work (and Im sure more will get to make an appearance in season 2).
hmexwo8,Sargerassssss,11/28/2021,1,,Have you ever herd of Heimerdinger Sona Seraphine? I wouldnt say they abilities lore wise are useful in combat. But they are still in League. If Riot wanted to they could fit Mel as a character based on gold like a support that gives gold to their adc when they hit skill shots or something like Kalistas thing that you chose an ally at the start of your game and if you kill a minion that champ gets half the gold of seid minion while you still get a full amount.
hmetjtv,YandereMuffin,11/28/2021,1,16.0,Its pretty good art dont get me wrong.  But I feel like Jinxs head/hair has just been put onto someone elses body lol :/  *maybe its just me*

hmeqo1n,RechargedFrenchman,11/28/2021,1,377.0,Yeah thats fair especially the bottom teams that could get relegated basically only guarantee sponsors because they cant get booted for playing badly. How CLGs LoL team has any in the first place regardless though I still dont understand.

hmeqq5y,SG_Taliyah,11/28/2021,1,324.0,but not safely dive and be a top-tier teamfighter with 3 casts of an AoE knockup. Most champs that can safely dive like that are either early game focused or much easier to punish than Aatrox.

hmdlqij,JamisonDouglas,11/28/2021,1,165.0,A soloq player.  He hasnt even played a game of amateur yet. Other than twitch rivals this is the first reasonably competitive game he has played that isnt soloq or clash. And he was against a world finalist. He did pretty good given the circumstances.  Only real criticism thats fair is his champion pool is extremely exploitable and he will need to work on that relatively quickly.

hmevr0x,haven4ever,11/28/2021,1,338.0,In the Arcane cast yes but in the wider lore I doubt he’s anywhere close to top tier. Even with Z-drive and time control the amount of damage he can inflict is minimal to any non-standard human character and the damage he can tank is likely minimal as well. But given his youth and innovation prowess who knows how strong he will become.
hmelinh,_Hayth_,11/28/2021,1,4.0,thats totally fine :) i appreciate the comment you should definitely try the build out though !

hme3iao,RedZoomTV,11/28/2021,1,2.0,I just did a quick test in the practice tool:        It seems that different pings have different timers. Some pings Ive counted to take 45 seconds if you constantly spam them and 25 WHOLE SECONDS if you dont touch it since the ping mute. This is very disturbing and I feel like if riot was not going to change this we should at least have knowledge of when we can ping again! It can just be a small timer on the screen in a corner somewhere with an icon of a ping and a timer :)

hmeuad3,PK_SPAMING,11/28/2021,1,4.0,Welp people loved Arcane and seeing Jayce\`s 2 fight scenes is enought to inspire them to play him but since its low elo people go straight to ranked with a transform champion (which are harder than normal champs) and than proceed to feed. You\`ll have to wait for the hype to fall off to play normaly. Sadly thats just how it is.
hmeqe6z,SG_Taliyah,11/28/2021,1,324.0,They didnt want aatrox to be able to lose lane pop ult in a teamfight and just fucking run at the ADC to be a reliable way to win every teamfight.

hme9qlz,supadankgreen420,11/28/2021,1,339.0,Damn man when you list all their blunders like that that’s when you realise just how badly Regi and co fucked things up. Just 5 years ago TSM was THE premier brand in NA and one of the most respected orgs in the world. It’s insane how far their stock has fallen since then.  And to make things worse TL and C9 have literally been the biggest benefactors from their mistakes.   1) TSM kicking Doublelift in 2017 was the catalyst to all TL’s early success. That’s what drove him to perform at an elite level all those splits from 2018-19.   2) Core himself said that his biggest motivation for moving to NA in 2019 was to play alongside DL. He’s probably the best import to ever play in the LCS and continues to make a huge impact.  3) TL picks up Tactical for cheap from TSMA and he steps up decently to replace DL in 2020 helping them to stay competitive and make it to worlds. Now TL sells him back to TSM at a premium great business for them.  4) Now TL continues to attract some of the best players in the west like Jensen Alphari Bwipo Hans and even Bjerg the face of TSM since 2014 with the allure of teaming up with Core.  5) Coming to C9 they picked up Svenskeren for cheap managed to make worlds semis with him and then sold him to EG for big money. The funds gained from that sale was crucial for future signings like Vulcan.  6) C9 also signed Zven from TSM and he played an important role in their two LCS title wins. Also they would not have been able to attract Perkz and Mithy to NA without his help.   No wonder Steve and Jack love Regi so much lol. TSM had such a massive edge over the rest of the competition and they squandered everything. If Spica leaves next year after his contract expires that could be fatal to their brand in LoL. Wouldn’t be surprised at all if yet again it was TL to steal their star player. 💀

This inhouse was way more for fun then twitch rivals and the whole team was a massive gap outside of maybe midlane and adc. Gs will be fine and should really look at this as a way to really improve on tank picks.

hmewz5c,Ninjahound789,11/28/2021,1,338.0,Weve seen Vis limit if humans could take multiple hits from her and survive in Arcane then even he best would probably barely injure Sett.  The gauntlets are also not all that durable if her first collides with Setts even without him using his magic the guantlet will be shattered while Sett would likely be hurt a decent bit. Sett is also a ton faster than Vi and has more experience so realistically she wont land a single hit before going down unless he wants her to.  This is hardly a fair fight in any sense the gap between Sett and Vi in power is huge. Its like someone asking about whod win between Sett and Volibear and trying to argue that since Voli is a brute Sett would stand a chance when the lore implies that it would be a one hit kill.
hmdtpcc,Scrinwarrior,11/28/2021,1,154.0,No no no let’s get more specific.   1. Sevika does have Shimmer in her veins yes but she does NOT have purple veins covering her face and body. So while she is using it it is mostly a function of her fancy arm not something that she has huge amounts of in her actual blood. Her eyes flash purple for a split second then nothing. So comparing her to Deckard or any other roided-as-fuck Shimmer monster is completely off base.  2. Sett is magical. This is canonly from his Vastayan side which makes him faster stronger and more durable than a normal human. Sevika may have been more durable and stronger but she fought at the same speed as Vi which means Sett would have the agility advantage over her in terms of reflexes.  3. If I do take your assumption that Sevika is massively boosted by the Shimmer then what is your explanation for Vi being able to survive a hit from Sevika? Even if Sevika isn’t a normal human Vi is and if Sevika is boosted half as much as you claim then Vi’s head would be caved in from the first blow. Naturally it isn’t because Sevika isn’t as powerful as you think but your logic is flawed all the same.  4. Vi oneshotting jobber villains is not a feat. Even Jayce was doing that and we KNOW he isn’t a naturalborn fighter.

Meanwhile Vayne Ashe Draven and Kog all have absurd win rates on LT.

hmepl2z,CreepyMosquitoEater,11/28/2021,1,2.0,So that you have to buy champions to get free shit. You cannot earn a chest if you dont own the champion even if its on free week. Honestly i think its a fair system riot makes money two ways by selling you the content that you unlock in the chests or by having a rigid playerbase that invites more people to join that will buy the content that they are selling. So its not in their interest to give you a lot of free shit if you dont play the game a lot either.

My theory is that S2 will be more about the world Singed will try to ressurect Orianna and either Noxus will offer him help in exchange for his help in Ionia OR he actually succeeds but Orianna hates him for what hes done so he leaves Zaun.   Than Ionia show will end with Swain taking over Noxus sending Urgot to Zaun which will start Arcane season 3.   And season 4 will be Jhin visits the opera

hmem76u,DANKKlNG,11/28/2021,1,315.0,Dont think so. What i do know is that nobody used to wear gloves. And so most strikers used to break their knuckles and retire after a small amount of fights while grapplers like the gracies never got injured like that. So after winning everybody saw grappling as THE way to fight. At that point even boxing was seen as a “fake” martial art. As the years passed people incorporated different type of martial arts like thai boxing karate and not too long ago capoeira.  These days people still believe grappling to be the best form of fighting. But its not. Grappling is great in a fair 1v1 with rules. But anybody trying to play mma boy and starts grappling in a street fight will soon find themselves in the hospital at best.

There are already cards in LoR with units similar to Hextech/Chemtech dragon and they are really cool.

Its still pretty much the same as the new lore  only in the new stuff its the hexgems placed in the gauntlets themselves that make them usable.   The gauntlets themselves are definitely lighter in the new lore though - she definitely would not be able to drag around the dead weight of a broken gauntlet if they were 8000 pounds like she sort of does in arcane

hmebljc,Xonra,11/28/2021,1,714.0,I meant not planetary as in he doesnt really care about the planet so much as the universe. Hes on a much grander scale than just the planet. Which is why youd have to just leave him out. He could sneeze Viego out of existence but its unlikely he would ever bother to even pretend to think about caring to do it.
hmei2xr,Walachmid_Boshlam,11/28/2021,1,,I mean this description could work for any humanoid though. I would guess the reason hes purple is because of his disease which may be why he covers up so much if it has to do with how vulnerable he is to the sun.   The giqnt part also makes me think he isnt human since hes pretty short compared to most humans in league but maybe his species is even smaller than him.

hmdihpw,Vice_xxxxx,11/28/2021,1,802.0,What a stupid review
hme57qm,leastlol,11/28/2021,1,315.0,TSM has had plenty of good players other than Bjergsen. Most recently the best decision they’ve made was to promote Spica to the main roster the second time (putting him in during playoffs was a disaster).  Before then Amazing Santorin Lustboy and WildTurtle come to mind for good pickups. Dyrus kind of just melded into the team after living with them for a long time (and TRM kind of imploding himself). In the past three years there’s been nearly nothing good to say about the way they’ve managed the LoL team from questionable roster decisions to things like splitting time between Akaadian and Grig (now Armao) putting Spica in during playoffs running Lost over Doublelift mikeyeung kicking Doublelift/Bio to pick up Zven/Mithy (making it impossible to import jungle or top).  Still for some reason fans are giving TSM a pass and seem perfectly fine that through three mediocre years (particularly for TSM whose stated goal was to win worlds) we’ve seen zero changes in leadership or management roles.
hmel7av,Random_Stealth_Ward,11/28/2021,1,129.0,I like Seraphine specifically because she doesnt feels like Sona and I hate Sona so much that i disenchanted her DJ skin in loot as soon as I got it.  With this in mind making Sona into Seraphine would definitely push a lot of her players away since Sona is an enchanter and Seraphine is much closer to an actual mage support like Zyra or Annie that simply happens to have an AOE/speed boost. the shield is neither available enough that she would get more than 2 in a long Teamfight and its also not getting many points put into it that it would be that good.

hmdn6jy,j_u_n_h_y_u_k,11/28/2021,1,236.0,vasilii was such a mess to follow. really is unfortunate what the player came to be after his rise to stardom here in NA
hmeskwt,stampydog,11/28/2021,1,47.0,Jhin was in Piltover but he was caught by Shen Zed and Akali there. Its not known what happens afterwards coz the comic follows Zed who leaves after they catch him but it can be assumed that he was taken back to prison by Shen and Akali. The only P&Z champ that interacts with Jhin while hes there is Camille so it would be weird to do with Arcane. Obviously they can rewrite the canon if they want to but to me the comics feel more legit than the other stories on universe so I doubt Riot would mess with them.

Cloud9 did this back in the day with the Balls / Meteos / Hai / Sneaky / LemonNation roster. They were only bought by Quantic after theyd one the promotion qualifier and then only sold to Jack after winning the promotion tournament. They werent even an org yet until theyd already earned their place in the LCS.   Cloud9 won back to back season titles in the first two seasons in the LCS and are still one of the biggest and most popular orgs in *League*. And they were a promotion team.

hmeg0np,LOLCraze,11/28/2021,1,13.0,Sounds like you just have bad positioning. 3 mythics are viable for all ADCs. 4/5 for some. Mages have this new item that prevents oneshot with the shield. There are also legendaries that you can build depending on situation. Zhonyas Wits end banshees axiom etc. Maybe maw is a little weak currently but still viable in some situations.
hmewghl,animebuyer123,11/28/2021,1,44.0,I mean theres a bunch of tier 1 champs like hecarim that benefit from going FoN early and completely fuck you up if you go shadowflame so not really you cannot possibly go shadowflame over void staff its just not worth it especially cause most mages also need zhonyas and maybe even heal reduction theres just no timing for shadowflame to be efficient.

hmeehek,thorpie88,11/28/2021,1,14.0,You couldnt be banned on OCE for a couple years after Riot released it as their was no report feature. Then it got okay but still pretty shit as there was lots of reportable behaviour but not enough people at Riot OCE to go through all the reports so nothing happened to a lot of people.   Now we have NA doing our reports so its a bit better but we are now an extra workload of the NA guys so people still slip through the cracks.   This is especially worse for the games at the highest elo which already had groups willing to ruin games if they didnt like you but Riot OCE would actively work with pros and ex pros that sent complaints about players. With NA handling it theres no streamlined way for people to make the highest level of play better

So by your argument its enough to pay rent for the rest of your life even if you do the absolute bare minimum with no investing or extra income and you are trying to argue its not that much? A couple million in your 20s will easily set you up for a comfortable life if you dont completely piss it away

hmemi70,TheNeys,11/28/2021,1,319.0,Jg has just too much relevancy over the game duration. Junglers dictate way too much the early game have to secure objectives during the midgame and in the lategame a jg death usually means free baron/soul/ancient -> game ends.  At least before they had only real combat summoner what meant they were not super duelists but hey let’s give jg the most OP summoner spell ever that you can also take in 2 different forms and with the shortest cooldown of the game…  This is not fun for neither part. For 4 players most games get decided by who has the best jg since the early game advantages usually decide the entire outcome and for junglers isn’t fun either since their role is too stressful and they get flamed a lot if the other jg is just better.  IMO jg should be a supportive role and that would be muuuuch healthier for the game.

hme99yl,YumFruits,11/28/2021,1,311.0,The thing is that the soul has always been intended to be a buff that heavily swings in favor of the team that gets it. Its the reward for the jungler that plays for objectives instead of snowballing top carry. Ever since Riot changed the baron buff into the siege buff that makes minions stronger the game average length has gone down. They also introduced Herald that similarly pushed the total time down.   Chemtech might be tad overtuned in terms of power but the dragons (or baron/herald) have always increased the winning chance by a lot. Its just not as noticeable with other stuff because they dont directly factor into a win or loss. If theres a problem with chemtech or hextech dragon then its more the design that people dont like rather than how broken it is. Were still very early in on the new season but hextech might be just as broken if not more after people adapt into changes more.

hmdufyh,BluTcHo,11/28/2021,1,2.0,Its a good addition to the game imo it just needs tuning like any other new implementation in the game  Its a good way to tackle the problem of having a few players spamming ff15 after 3min of the game when they died twice in 1v1  Plus as the winning team you cant really complain about the system since it only rewards the opponents if you makes mistakes.  If you are the winning teams its your job to close the game and control it. I think that it makes the game more Macro oriented and avoid teams getting stomped with no come back possible because they died in lanes in early

hmdt3w1,yarrowbloom,11/28/2021,1,675.0,To get gold you need to focus on champ and role mastery (pick 2 champs in one role and only play those and only play that role). Players who are more experienced can play more but since you’re just going for -gold as soon as possible- you need to limit your champ pool and role to minimize the champ and matchups you have to learn. You need to develop an understanding of when that champion is strong and how it should win the game (what does it want to do in team fights? What does it want to do in lane?). You also need to work on having a certain level of CS. Watching people like Neace you’re going to have to be careful to not overwhelm yourself with concepts and goals.   Set a small goal for each session and play in small blocks of games taking a break for the day if u lose 3+. These small goals can just be things like “remembering to ward/using health potions while fighting/looking for opportunities to auto my opponent when in lane/making sure I don’t waste my summoner spells or hold them too long/place my wards down when I have stacks/push the wave and back every time I have 1k gold/notice what objectives are coming up soon by pressing tab and backing to buy 40 sec before they spawn”. Focus on this one small thing and work on it over many games. Don’t try and get better at everything at once. If it feels overwhelming in the game watch your replays after your games and look for opportunities where you could have better achieved your goal.  Since you’re so new a lot of the game will just be improving your knowledge of matchups and what the different champions do and how strong they are at certain points. Get excited and enjoy the process!
hmdzryq,steve_pays_me,11/28/2021,1,299.0,its funny - I feel like the star players of the last four or five years were the first real pros.  before then by and large it was people getting paid in mousepads.  and in NA especially its like some of them didnt get the memo that this was always a temp gig.    finish high school kids.

hmeny3a,JesiAsh,11/28/2021,1,4.0,Stories are still less predictable... Silco could be a new champion and he died. Unless something will resurrect him because LoL universe can bring people from the dead faster than Dragon Ball anime.  Ruination was perfect for killing champions and Riot invented stupid res-gun to counter Ruined Skins. They will never kill anyone... not for long (Gankplank).

hmei9l4,Zerhap,11/28/2021,1,304.0,So this is a arcane biased question right? cause a human beating a vastayan in hand to hand fair combat sounds impossible. Even with her gloves and in a 2 v 1 with Caitlyn using rubber bullets Sett has the upper hand.  There is not even a fair fight for Sett in the rooster imo they either too weak like Vi or too strong like Udyr. Maybe Sylas while using magic or Illaoi/braum but not sure.

hmdl2ig,Bubbachukka,11/28/2021,1,2.0,Depends on who you’re playing vs who they’re playing as well as items. Like a mage vs an ADC in most cases the mages ability’s are gonna deal more than the ADC but the ADCs auto attacks are gonna deal more than the mages. Then you have tanks and bruisers and such that have shields and healing. And with items stuff like armour and magic resist is gonna go a long way to surviving attacks. So it’s situational really.   What champ are you playing?

The reactions are 100% real even Unmercey and I were shocked that such a devastating thing could happen. Then we left like 5 mins after.     Video description on the original video.

hme8sfh,Psyr1x,11/28/2021,1,,That runs counter to what riot typically does...  Whenever they tease a champion whos already known in lore in some capacity they appeal to that.  And again the only reason people think its Corina is because shes a visually striking chem baron.   She is not the only one weve seen or heard of.   And the words theyve used as of yet would point towards it *not* being Corina because again not only are there no allusions to plants in the description they *specifically* point to the core theme being *money* and that the support *buys* everything rather than having made the innovations themselves...  this is *important* to Corina.  &#x200B  *She* is the one to have made her flowers and *she* is the one to have a very hands-on approach to almost everything she does.

hmdioua,UNDEADMANBEARPIG,11/28/2021,1,11.0,Sadly the community can be horrible as your friends so kindly demonstrated.  Its a big learning curve.. so dont expect to be good overnight. Theres 153 champions right now with their own abilities and playstyles.. it takes time and patience watch videos try champions play ARAM...  Find a role you like test things out..  If you have an addictive personality it may be best to stay away all together as the game can get very addictive for a lot of people.  But as mentioned below.. if your friends are screaming at you knowing full well youre a new player you wont learn much. You might want to find others to play with.. Finding a full kind supportive team makes the games SO much more enjoyable than people giving you shit.  Its one thing to go WHY THE FUCK DID YOU GO IN AND DIE??! as opposed to oh by the way be careful if theyre a couple levels up its likely theyll destroy you in a fight  Attitude is everything in this game.

hmdodvf,JaylenBGOAT,11/28/2021,1,,I really shouldnt respond to this with anything other than popular does not mean good unless youre a weird coping stan.  How about what actual critics think or people that actually dive into the music in depth about what is actually the best? Not everyone is just going for the most mainstream appeal. Music is entirely subjective but strictly sales is the worst way to find who makes the best.   Again not everyone makes movies just for the sake of money. Theres a reason why tons of actors go from blockbusters to more intricate roles. Like do you not listen to a single indie or underground artist who doesnt just go for sales?  Which is determined by the quality of team not the sales just like amount of sales doesnt inherently mean the best in music.  Your arguments that most popular music means best music is just some coping that you like a boring ass band lmao.  So youre incapable of using analogies that arent completely 1 to 1. Do you think Cardi B or 69 are really good rappers? Or MGK is a good punk artist?   They make bland formulaic music that appeals to people that dont really care to derive anything meaningful from music which is fine they can make whatever shit they want but stop with the copium that theyre doing anything spectacular other than appealing to the most amount of people possible.   What about imagine dragons do you think is really good outside of a lot of people listen to them.
hmdxdck,jorissvd,11/28/2021,1,667.0,What does it matter? Why would League need/have a main character? Why would you want that? The world of Runeterra becomes a much more interesting place when everyone has a purpose in it.  All league champions are main characters. Simple.

hmed1n4,khadzad,11/28/2021,1,649.0,1. Jinx is prettier. 2. Jinx is not attention thot (well she do love attention but she has sell respect)
hmdwowb,Git_gudf,11/28/2021,1,39.0,Fioras strength in lane does not Come from the percent max HP true damage before you get more AD the damage Is pretty low. Her strength in lane Comes mostly from her sustain Q-poke damage and great all in potential.
hmedo1d,UndeadCakeMix,11/28/2021,1,5.0,The red one is the most common that was the one people spammed for opponents. The Blue one is the rarest imo because that was the mentor one
hme46l3,nizzy2k11,11/28/2021,1,36.0,This probably just means you should have less healing in the revive or it should roll down more definitively.
hmebri8,Wiindsong,11/28/2021,1,164.0,this is an interaction with axiom arc axiom arc will refund cooldown from takedowns even if the cooldown of the ability does not start until the buff wears off like from riven ult or when your pyke ult falls off.

hme7q27,Caenen_,11/28/2021,1,4.0,Not the sources the invisibility. Pretty much all invisibility does not get revealed by true sight reveals safe for true sight vision of turrets except for Qiyana Q for some reason. But even that one is bugged on the PBE aswell.

hme3j1i,InvitemetoSkeet,11/28/2021,1,40.0,Youre right they should just make dodges count as a loss
hme2k6d,yasiqu,11/28/2021,1,43.0,actually being pushed under turret is not entirely optimal for ganks since you will be losing CS (freezing is better). besides that it might not have been the right to leave bot alone in that situation - i didnt watch the game i dont know - but annoying the jungler with it especially afterwards wont do anything in most cases. rather focus on your own laning than on what your jungler does.
hmdj5gb,SirKrisX,11/28/2021,1,610.0,Riot definitely knows something we dont.  Jinx is also the poster girl for Wild Rift and unlike Ahri/Akali was in 1.0 Legends of Runeterra.
hmdrfr1,papu16,11/28/2021,1,16.0,Omnivamp for some users is better(especially that ones with true damage) thats why camille&fiora still buying this item.

hme5pjf,Jinzo_9,11/28/2021,1,315.0,People who are still clamoring for Hauntzer to return to LCS obviously didnt watch 2021 Academy. TSM.A was pretty bad other than Yursan and Takeover.

hmeasly,FireDevil11,11/28/2021,1,1103.0,Normal mmr highly affects ranked mmr espcially if you have never played ranked on a new account. Which is why botted accounts that play ranked get placed bronze 1 or silver 4 and new accounts that only played normal and have high winrate can get placed gold 4. Which is why people were getting +25 and -6 in master+ elo.  When I play normals I get placed with at least 2 or 3 other diamond players on each team my cousin when he plays normals has only silver players with some bronze/gold mixed in sometimes.

hme3aag,Drwixon,11/28/2021,1,23.0,Well its a downgrade for sure  old ravenous hydra felt like an impactful buy that could turn matchups when bought at least on Camille and Fiora (Champs i play). Now i build it mostly because of the haste and nothing else  the healing is not impactful at all . I wish they would revert Tiamat items altogether and locking Champs who buy both Whip + tiamat from having 2 auto resets.  I build it on Camille because it feels better to play with Haste and the build path is better than Titanics for Camille but Titanic is almost always the better choice .

Rav Hydra was fairly good before its random and undeserved nerfs with many of these champions viably using it as a core item (hellRivens best build had her rushing it as a first item)

hme19ht,deeyo95,11/28/2021,1,6.0,Personally I think players should just learn to accept losses without tilting ( for your own good/mental ) especially when you know you lost because someone smurfed on the enemy team.  As others have stated Riot cant really do much about it. At the end of the day just playing enough with a good mental will get you the rank that you deserve as your win rate will even out in time.   Just my own two cents ✌🏻
hmddut9,chomperstyle,11/28/2021,1,278.0,Its fine on mages or adcs but skirmishers and bruisers make it horrible

hmdspeq,Scrinwarrior,11/28/2021,1,154.0,I think that’s easy to say when we have an entire series of canon material to pull from with Vi and basically nothing to use with Sett.  And yes while Vi has all those things she still nearly lost to Sevika. Vi is a normal human. Sett doesn’t need superhuman power to knock her out any more than anyone else.   We know that canonically Sett does have access to some level of Vastayan magic so I wouldn’t be selling him so drastically short.

hmdvfc5,mbr4life1,11/28/2021,1,5.0,Man I only saw squid game with subtitles it was jarring hearing the English. Forgot about the dub.   Also for your life change is never instantaneous. You just have to become the new person. Then as you go through time your patterns and interactions will result in being who you want to be. An easy way to see this is exercising. When you start working out you arent in shape. Over time you become fit. When did you become the fit person? In reality when you focused with conviction to become in shape and set your mind on that process you became that in shape person separated by time not reality.  So if you want to lead a different life or become a different person start interacting with reality in the form and manner you aspire to and then that process through time will provide the results you seek.   Good luck to you!
hmdpemm,Ronizu,11/28/2021,1,77.0,Yeah dodging the skin system by using existing skins for free is absolutely bannable. But if you want to use the penis Illaoi skin then Im pretty sure you while obviously taking a risk wont be banned at least currently.

hmeifrc,FlashwithSymbols,11/28/2021,1,304.0,None of your points really apply since Sett just out does her in them. Yeah Vi has beaten people several times her size but those guys are just normal cannon fodder and arent trained like Sett and she just out skills them.   Yes she has experience in a cell but Sett has way more fight experience. He fought in the pits to survive against other very skilled fighters to become the eventual winner and boss of the underground. Fight experience and training in a cell are nothing compared to Sett literally fighting everyone in the underground.  Being half vastayan doesnt just give him magic but way more physical capabilities hes stronger and much faster than a normal human. I just dont see Vi overcoming it in any case.

hme3c3l,RedZoomTV,11/28/2021,1,3.0,This is especially needed as I almost just lost a game due to this -        I was dead I had 2 teammates alive while the enemy team only had 1 zed. My jax was going to the nexus which was completely open while MF for whatever reason pinged the hextech dragon for jax to help her.        What ended up happening is Jax almost killed zed but zed lived and MF solod dragon instead of following jax. The whole time MF was Pinging dragon I was trying to spam ping the nexus and MF to end the game as the enemy team only had 1 person alive and it wouldve been free.        I only use pings to communicate as in all my years of playing league since season 2 Ive been talking in chat non stop mostly useless things and gotten many of my accounts perma banned because of it. Therefore I decided to disable my chat completely not even being able to open it so that I would prevent further bans and actually focus on the game. That worked as I got my first honor check point in pretty much ever and Ive gotten a higher rank

hmdypl7,Lord_Dust_Bunny,11/28/2021,1,19.0,10% Omnivamp is a massive nerf over 18% lifesteal for both the champs you listed.  Camilles main damage comes from her Q which does additional damage on her regular attack (and thus has full value from lifesteal). The only benefit Omnivamp has is that it will heal her from Ws damage and Rs tiny on hit damage.  Fioras main damage comes from autos and Q both of which get full value from lifesteal. Omnivamp does let her heal directly off of Vital damage but such a large amount of Fioras damage is physical that lifesteal still provides more value.  Omnivamp for most users that wanted Ravenous Hydra is a straight nerf. And for most bruisers Omnivamp is a garbage stat in general because they only get 1/3rd the value on AoE.
hmelz0d,Realnic0le,11/28/2021,1,11.0,I have nothing to explain. Its an alt account. I have a couple accounts in bronze too with negative wr guess that means Im bronze by ur logic.

hme3cjs,RedZoomTV,11/28/2021,1,3.0,I just did a quick test in the practice tool:        It seems that different pings have different timers. Some pings Ive counted to take 45 seconds if you constantly spam them and 25 WHOLE SECONDS if you dont touch it since the ping mute. This is very disturbing and I feel like if riot was not going to change this we should at least have knowledge of when we can ping again! It can just be a small timer on the screen in a corner somewhere with an icon of a ping and a timer :)

hmdqia1,aereiaz,11/28/2021,1,,Its a matter of resources bud. Someone on your team has to get the short end of the stick when it comes to drafts. Bwipos team chose to secure him the counterpick every round. Sn1pers chose to weakside top and play around other lanes. If you dont take that into consideration then youre doing both players a disservice by acting like its a big deal when Sn1per lost lane in a lane where his champ has literally a 40% winrate.   There are no top lane champions that are good versus every champion in the game. Pretty much every single one has at least a few counters that will hard shit on you in the lane and your only option is to give up CS and pray your jungler comes. Renekton used to be the go-to for blind picks but hes utter garbage now.   So many Reddit analysts have this bizarre soloQ vacuum mentality where they ignore everything leading up to WHY someone lost their lane. If you queue up the enemy toplaner gets counter pick and your jg never helps you then youre going to lose the lane unless youre literally a hard smurf.

Riven was a survivor of the massacre and defected and eventually found Yasuos master. Yasuo was supposed to guard him but had abandoned him to fight Noxians.

hmdobi0,WintersEnvoy,11/28/2021,1,485.0,I just mentioned some obvious gutter champs but it goes for a lot of adcs aphelios samira are in a similar boat for their very brief dominance in pro play. Caitlyn similar to aphelios not unplayable in soloq (but she is in pro play). But non otps tend to leave these champs alone. But moving on from the fact that Im talking about like half the roster varus ezreal tristana jhin xayah etc. Jhin is probably maybe? Okay in botlane? But would anyone honest to god argue hes an actually decent champ? A 10/0 Jhin cant kill an 0/5 jungler/toplaner because they built only tabis for gods sake.  What about the jungle argument I brought up? Are we gonna seriously argue there was even the slightest argument to give Graves a +1 ad per level buff given his pro play history???? As long as graves is ever over 48 % winrate you cant possibly ever argue for any adc oh we cant buff them cuz of pro play. The last time an adc got a buff like that was MF after armor pen into lethality rework which screwed her main yomuus builds back in the day. And junglers legitimately get these kinds of buffs regularly for champs that are underutilized not even bad (like varus tristana sivir).  **Its just mental acrobatics from the subreddit and far more infuriating than what riot does because riot actually reads reddit posts and twitter feeds and they legitimately take some of that fucking nonsense to heart even if they try to be impartial. Its hypocritical as fuck.**  It doesnt help that when riot does try to buff adcs in some meaningful way that isnt +5 base dmg per ability rank they do it in such excruciatingly nonsensical ways. Take sivir for example sivir Q got buffed I think the 2nd last time she was buffed. Why? Sivirs Q is already by far the best adc Q in the game for any damage ability compared to xayah cait or varus Q. I get that theres supposed to be identities to champions but what sivir needed was something like a range buff for autos or auto enhancer for her W since bounces even since the last buff to her W are pathetic and you could couple this with adjustments elsewhere like nerfing her very powerful Q dmg. Because crit autos without enchancers are a genuine joke thats why only champs with actual crit enchancers (cait passive xayah w ashe q etc) actually hit for damage and champs like sivir or tristana has wet noodle autos in lategame full crit build. I can repeat this kind of nonsensical direction for a lot of adcs tristana got the E buff with crit enhancing why? Tristana E already hit like a truck her biggest dmg tool got a huge buff she wasnt really played much more would anyone guess why? Yeah no shit she has the same issues. Longest CDs in the game and her E is super predictable and counterplayable for most champs. She hits like a wet noodle so even if shes the best self peel adc in the game shes still garbanzo lategame and her all in kit is just a cheese lane champ that needs to win lane to accomplish any wins. What tristana needed was also some kind of crit enhancer or possibly lowered CDs and adjustments (nerfs) to her all in which is absolutely ridiculous and cancerous and I dont think a single player enjoys playing into it??? So Why the fuck buff her E? Why not buff CDs nerf all in or buff crit autos and nerf all in. It was purely nonsensical it couldve made her a pickable but not infuriating to play against champion.  *Could repeat this with a lot of champs but you get the idea I think kaisa also got some similar nonsensical direction change before when they made a change to her W Q that was pure nerf through and through when she was already sub 50 % winrate and riot didnt even call it a nerf. Riots team is legitimately incompetent at adc changes not every adc will be good or viable but it sure as fuck doesnt have to be limited to like 3-4 adcs. And every time the gold goblins come out of the pits of elo hell on social medias to defend any changes or lack thereof with their braindead pro play take cherry picked data without any clue of how the game works.*

If it was the latter than it would expected that he would try his best to compete with them this means getting along with your teammates learning mandarin etc. I’m not saying he didn’t but currently it sounds like he didn’t make an effort to do so. Sure he may have felt homesick or unmotivated and a little depressed but when signing the contract he made a commitment to the team and the stories coming out right now don’t reflect kindly on him.

hmecv5d,Party-47,11/28/2021,1,47.0,Speaking of Chemtech but the dragon buff instead of the map effect:  The wiki state it as Chemtech Drake buff: + 5 / 10 / 15 / 20% (based on stacks gained from slaying the Chemtech Drake) increased damage against enemies with 340 − 1020 (based on targets level) greater current health than the buff holder.  This implies that there isnt a curve? So I always get either the full 5\*x% damage increase and I cant get a 4% damage increase if my target has some health more than me but not way more?  That is really weird and very different from how most more health than you  effects work not a big fan of it honestly.  Or is the phrasing just inconsistent but it actually works more similarily to how other effects of that type work?

You could just build your normal setup and youd still stomp the game.   Its a decent 3rd-5th item on lethality champions. Everything else is purely 4fun where youd have done just as well if not better building something good

hmeou0q,RechargedFrenchman,11/28/2021,1,368.0,The top teams never need to worry so long as they remain on top the bottom teams have genuine consequences for remaining at the bottom and it gives new talent the opportunity to win into the big league. From a fan perspective whats not to like?  Hell *Cloud9* was originally a promotion team. They tried to get into the LCS with their original roster but failed changed their name and two players and tried again and *succeeded* winning the qualifier tournament to get into the promotion tournament and then going undefeated in that. They got promoted to play in the LCS.   If Promotion/Relegation had never become a thing for a little while the original guys on C9 may have made it into the LCS eventually but that team that was so iconic and *won back to back season titles in its first two years* would likely never have played together. But franchising makes Riot more money so thats what were stuck with.

Because Ezreal is someone who explores and has his own adventures hes not tied down to anything so they can tell countless stories through him. And they wouldnt be bound to a genre. They can tell little 1-2 episode long stories or large world sized story arcs. As far as creative freedom Ezreal and Ryze are probably the best.

Pre 6 if you cant safely cs just let em go. Just stay in lane getting XP until you hit 6. You get back in the game in terms of farming once you get 11.

hmdj58u,SkyRider123,11/28/2021,1,98.0,If i recall correctly Ascended in general are enhanced humans.  The Shuriman Ascended were created through use of the Sun Disc such as Azir Nasus and Renekton.  Darkin such as Kayn and Aatrox are Shuriman Ascended who altered themselves through blood magic. The Darkins are generally bound inside weapons which is what Red Kayn(Rhaast) represents this is Rhaast taking over.  As /u/3ic3 said the demons are being such as Eve Tahm Nocturne and Fiddle.  While Aspects are connected to Mount Targon and are essentially like gods. Some champs are host to an Aspect such as Taric. In this category we also have people like Diana Leona and Patheon.

hme6n26,astolfriend,11/28/2021,1,333.0,I mean I think the prevailing logic is that NA doesnt have a shot at worlds (whether true or not) and that they can still make money streaming and will make more money not taking a paycut to play. If youre earning millions probably makes a lot more sense to keep that up for a year then potentially take a sub 1m contract for multiple years.
hmddgd3,Parrotparser7,11/28/2021,1,85.0,Personally I was more a fan of the Long-range soldier-pursuit vision. Shuffles right now are slick but they dont translate into actual pursuit.

hme68nn,WervieOW,11/28/2021,1,8.0,It is. When you play Kayn you wanna play with the walls. So a TF ulting you should get close to a wall u can jump over. He also had flash so he could get even further away.

hmdewmy,newindianclassic,11/28/2021,1,197.0,Hey man I appreciate your response. I was being an asshole with my comment I should have been more chill.   I think I took what you said initially as being hyperbolic but I definitely see where youre coming from with this comment. That makes sense. I think Doublelift has a bit of team influence he pushes his teammates to be better and he also has that clutch factor across multiple rosters. His play wasnt amazing in 2020 summer but I still think he brought a lot to the table in terms of leadership and such. I also think hed be top 5 ADC for at least his first split back. Not a guarantee that he makes any team good (see TL spring 2020) your concern is warranted. I think your points overall are valid--Sven and Solo havent been outstanding recently but I think with the right dynamic they could be.   That isnt contrary to most of what you said and I appreciate your level response. Sorry that I was a bit of an asshole with my initial comment.

hme8wv5,Skyinblue163,11/28/2021,1,257.0,In season 3 when the most experience you could have was 4 yrs... Also two years is a ton of time to develop league skills and GS has never played an amateur or scrim even. Saying experience matters when Bwipo was playing in worlds when GS was 11. All around worst comparison Ive seen lmao
hme0vwx,Psyr1x,11/28/2021,1,20.0,The image has a *vaguely* floral aesthetic to it and certainly not reminiscent of the flowers Corina is known for.   And again the teaser had zero puns that allude to what truly is important to Corina as a character both in terms of aesthetics and in traits.  Def dont look like the stamen of a flower they are more reminiscent of modified petals/leaves and even then its a relatively loose connection.  It could just as easily be pumps pushing out gas.  If the champion is intended to Corina they will put puns that reference plants and toxins or at the least that these are *her* innovations... not things made by other people that she just buys (this is in addition to the lack of flower/plant puns is why it comes across very unlikely to be Corina atm).

hmdf58f,MapPotential9009,11/28/2021,1,23.0,Its equally as frustrating for veteran players to have these new players on your team. When 3/5 players have no map awareness the enemy can just roll over you. The current matchmaking system is broken there is a clear skill gap between enemies and teammates the game has become painful to play. This must also be frustrating for new players who would be getting flamed by teammates. The entire system needs an overhaul.

hme0fx2,00Dandy,11/28/2021,1,15.0,Welcome\^\^  LoL can be difficult to get into for new players so be aware of that and dont feel discouraged if some matches are pretty rough.   In the beginning Id recommend mostly playing vs AI until you get a good grasp of the games core concepts.  Try out different champions and see what you like but you will probably have an easier time if you play tanks. I always recommend Garen to new players because I also played him when I started out.  The tutorial doesnt teach you everything so I would recommend watching a beginner guide on YT.  Two things you can focus on from the beginning is learning to last-hit minions consistently (you only get gold for minions if you kill them so you need to do the last hit for that) and looking at the mini map in the corner to see if enemies could come to your lane.  If you have questions better go to r/summonerschool. Its more helpful than this sub. If youre looking for people to play with you can check out r/LeagueConnect.  Although LoL can be a bit hard to get into its really worth it imo. I play LoL since 2015 and the game as well as its esports scene and lore have become a huge passion for me.
hmdo12b,PM_ME_EUW_RP_CODES,11/28/2021,1,41.0,Oh well if you enjoy to play most of the champs it has more sense for you to own all of them. Ty for the answer good luck with your collection to complete it with the rarest skins too!

The Nuguri situation really screwed them otherwise they surely would have picked up one of the star FAs.
hmdd56i,DangerousSeaweed0,11/28/2021,1,,> petricite armor would work fairly well against mages even if they arent fully covered in petricite a simple chestplate/emblem maybe on the chest would work wonders then the mage would have to actually think about what they were doing  full plate armor is very hard for most untrained people. making them wear an armor out of rocks (technically fossilized trees) is  straight up not viable because how cumberson is and most likely to produce as well.  Even if an emblem was enough  it doesnt change the fact that it might not be strong enough to cover an entire human body.   Lastly  magic can be used to different effects  not only to attack directly. Like.....imagine a mage teleporting an boulder 20 meters on top of you. Petricide armor wont protect u from non magical attacks  and while that attack is a result of magic (teleportation) in this case  its also not a direct magic attack on the user that the wepon can nulify  because its literally just a rock crushing on you.  And there are a crapload of other similar effects that magic can achieve without having the wearer as a direct target.    >really the root of demacias problem seems to be ill preparation  magic at its core is pure chaos. how do u prepare for chaos ? u dont know who is gonna have it. u dont know how it will manifest  or where it will manifest. It literally just an uncontralable force of nature.

hme2dzg,Drwixon,11/28/2021,1,23.0,The buildpath is fine . Riot tried to make the item more appealing for a larger variety of Champs.  Before the item rework there were like 3 champions who built this item in their first 3 core items . Camille and Fiora where the main ones  assassins like Rengar  Talon and Kayn built it only for tiamat and never completed ravenous.   Old ravenous had amazing synergy with both Camille and Fiora because it gave a whooping 80 AD and 18% fucking lifesteal on top of an autoreset.   The problem with the item is that the omnivamp does not feel impactful enough as opposed to the 18% lifesteal it had  few Champs could use it  but goddamn did it feel good on those . It boils down to omnivamp being a shit stat most of the time because it gets reduced to 333% on AoE spells which is what most champions who would want this item do (Red Kayn  Wukong  Zed and Riven) and for the original base like Camille and Fiora it will always heal less than the old one . The removal of the active did not help either because tbh tiamat was probably the strongest item component after like dirk because it gave Champs with bad Waveclear the ability to oneshot waves almost .  Also  its a luxury item on Riven and definitely not core . So basically nothing changed really Camille and Fiora still build it because they need waveclear and for others there is almost always a better choice .  In the best world Riot would revert tiamat but I doubt they would do it .

Also i never said the team was bad just that it was looking like a rather toxic work environnement for players or at least poorly managed so you could understand some players would rather stay in a team where they feel at ease than going there. Btw it was Fnatic that was trying to get Cabochard not the other way around.  Btw saying Fck  every 2 sentences does not make you more manly.
hmega19,Helixranger,11/28/2021,1,41.0,Ignoring that its likely a good portion of the members are either no longer playing the game is here because of Arcane only just following the pro scene and likely is mostly NA/EUW/(EUNE?) players estimates online show roughly 110-115 million players (okay at least accounts so it may be less due to smurfs) monthly on LoL at [October](https://leaguefeed.net/did-you-know-total-league-of-legends-player-count-updated/) and 180 million players including TFT/LoR/Wild Rift around [October too](https://mobile.twitter.com/riotgames/status/1455172784938651649)  Reddit is really a minority in the overall numbers. Its not as if they completely ignore everything Reddit has shown (a lot of bugs popped up in this subreddit for example) but there are other groups out there.
hmdhu3s,IlDaydreamIl,11/28/2021,1,36.0,Tahm is funny because pre-rework nobody knew he even existed and he was still broken. After rework people played him more because he was a bit more fun and now *some* people are complaining about him. He is broken as shit yeah. He has been broken as shit since he was released too. xD Just very few people knew he was broken in top so everyone played him supp since his release.  And Malph yeah. Nothing new either. A tank with a tank kit (Heavy cc hard engage and stuff that interacts scaling with his armor) apparently can have an AoE knockup ult with instant cast that has a 100% ap ratio for literally years. He only got it nerfed to 80% 22 days ago. Funny thing? He still oneshots adcs and mages even with 20% less ap ratio. Oh well.

hmdpytx,reverent-girl,11/28/2021,1,761.0,Sorry you quit after 30 games. Ranked gets much better when your mmr matches your rank. My first ranked game I was level 30 playing with a bunch of gold players and to this day that was the most toxic game I have played. I only play Ranked now because I love the competitiveness of it. Yes your team gets frustrated when you do bad but rarely is it that toxic. Whenever I play norms now the game feels so bad. Your teammates first time gnar jungle or afk after 5 minutes because they died twice in lane or people run it down. The chat might not be as harsh as ranked but the actual gameplay is 1000x more toxic. The only time I consistently see this lunacy in ranked is when I am playing at 3 in the morning. I have the most fun when I play Ranked with no chat.

She scales worse than like Kassadin Cassiopeia potentially Corki (tho iirc this one fluctuates) in mid but she for example fairly consistently crushes Orianna/Azir/Ryze/Syndra despite being down gold@15 in all of those matchups according to u.gg data.  Her scalings primarily on Q are pretty absurd Q is 65-97.5% (based on execute damage) + 9% from the passive note. Thats on a 5s base cd at max rank and you can double cast it a lot.

hmddm8w,Pure_Void,11/28/2021,1,17.0,yea
hmdnjgb,Nioubx,11/28/2021,1,36.0,Ive been playing from silver to low diamond across the 11 seasons and Ive never enjoy soloq as much as season 11 because it was the first season I disable allied and all chat.   I found that disabling chat is a good balance you can still communicate with ping and see your team pings and it mostly cover what you need in a game. You loose a bit of  coms but you gain the following benefit:  - you are not distracted reading and can focus on your plays - you are not tilted when you read horrible teammate and this is far better than muting them after seeing their are toxic as you might already be tilted - you are more incline to do what you think and own your errors because you choose to do something instead of listening to someone which directly leads to being able to identify your mistakes and improving  little bonus is that since its an interface setting you dont need to type /mute all every game :)  On a side note for people who says that you can meet nice people thanks to chat I feel its way easier to look for people that want to duoQ or team up outside the game than getting lucky and finding good teammate for you in soloQ.   Hope it can help :)
hmds8wt,Le_Terry,11/28/2021,1,1.0,Playing yes. Grinding no.  Just play normals solo or with friends in order to just stay in touch with the game and the changes. No need to grind. Take some time off and reset your mental for the new season.

hmdl7ze,Nakedzeldas1,11/28/2021,1,1.0,well my first bit of advice would be to find out what kind of impact you want to have on the game and what role you are going to want to be playing then find a few champs you really enjoy and learn the in and outs of them
hmdq53a,Voller_Faulheit,11/28/2021,1,289.0,Same suddenly I cant ward most of the enemy jungle like what? Assassins just have a field day with the shrouds being unwardable outside of control wards.
hme7b24,SaliAzucar,11/28/2021,1,57.0,This is the same for most unpopular champs.

hmdfwh2,Forward_Weakness8733,11/28/2021,1,2.0,stop playing with your friend for abit and play yourself ideally play vs bots and focus on learning how to farm. i reccomend top and mid cos they teach u how to play somewhat more independent rather than bot lane cos adc support required good coordination and understanding. Just relax and play to learn and have fun! just dont take the game too seriously

hmeca92,Fitzky45,11/28/2021,1,269.0,Youre severely overestimating the power of vis gauntlets. I blame the lack of any other proper media to showcase anything else in the league universe other than what we got in arcane but just know that there are beings that are so so much on another level compared to a human woman that punched walls in a prison cell. In the context of arcane vi looks strong compared to everyone else in the show but many other characters in runeterra would scoff at the mere thought of wasting their time fighting her.

If you play ONLY hypercarries chances are youre not that serious about the game and will peak plat if youre not bad. A sign that youre higher than plat would be that you *do* have a hypercarry but you have one or 2 other champs that you can pick when you know that hypercarry isnt going to work in this game.

hmej60x,UndeadCakeMix,11/28/2021,1,9.0,Green was the Great Teammate one and yeah it was the second most common because it was the one most people defaulted to for teammates. I dont remember yellow specifics but I do know blue ribbon was the hardest one for me to get from my experience.   The problem with it was league wasnt as toxic on the communications level but the understanding of the game was pure shit. You could do the same thing every game and literally have a different result bad choices could potentially be rewarded resulting in bad knowledge of the game. Most people didnt care to try to explain anything to anyone and the new player experience was genuinely worse. For example LOL was literally my first PC game prior to that I always played emulators and used controllers. I didnt even know how to move buy items or even chat. Not a single person tried to help. Reading tips and guides on PC gaming told me bullshit like use WASD to move like what??? PC gamers were genuinely not helpful in general so no one ever gave out the great mentor because there were little to none. AD Kathus used to be recommended by some of the players.

hme4msc,Mundane_Spend_7629,11/28/2021,1,4.0,That AI is like 30% of what OP ask in his post. The AI from Dota was learning the gameplay fighting against himself where the AI from the post has to learn from every single mistake a human player does and to add it in the data base. The AI from Dota completely jumped over this step because he was programmed to not do mistakes but if you add the mistakes into the equations those insane number of generations goes even further. The AI from the post will gonna have do decide how impactful are the mistakes the humans make so how he will decide if using the inting Sion strategy its a carry one or a ask to get carried one? Even 20 humans cant give a 20-0 answer so how they can program the AI to take this decision?   In the end even if we have the AI 100% functional if in one patch (random example) one core item for a champion gets nerfed so that champion not being so oppressively in early does that mean that the player now should not get the same LP like those before the patch just because they have less impact in early? Do those players still carry the game? His 0/10 teammate has more impact now? If the item gets a small buff and someone abuse it does this mean that his team had 0 impact in his 26/5/5 score so his team should be punished for this? If a rage player give 20 kills to the enemy mid then the enemy team (except mid) should get less LP because they got carried?  Now do you understand why such AI cant be made? If we dont have the answers then how the AI can have them?

hmeak4q,Blackestfun,11/28/2021,1,163.0,i think the items is balanced  because its only good in the early game where respawn timers are low and ult cds are long later in the game when you do a teamfight where 4 people die and you get the reset  you will mostly wait another 40seconds until they come back to lane and thats where your ult would be rdy anyway \^\^
hmdqbme,Ascedance,11/28/2021,1,133.0,Vi spent a lot of time in prison in conditions that seem very suboptimal for training. Its not like you can train for 8hrs/day and be 8x as strong as the guy that spends 1hr/day on training.  Did she get enough sleep and adequate nutrition for muscle growth? Did she take adequate rest days for recovery? The warden admits to guards having had a lot of talks with her which I assume means beating her up.. How did these injuries negatively affect her body?   How did she train? She seems to be in solitary does her training only consist of hitting the wall with her bare hands and if so how did that at all make her a better boxer? If we ignore the fact that her hands should be destroyed beyond usability its not like hitting a stationary object on end improves your technique at all.  Even if you go beyond reasonable doubt in all of these questions and ignore the gender gap in regards to strength.. probably wouldnt beat Sett nah  trained as much is probably not the right term but its a fact that Vi cannot have trained effectively in any way.

The instant Renekton used his Ascended powers he completely and utterly dominated the vastaya the same way a human might erase a beetle from existence.  So its more of if fighting an insane ascended incapable of using a single aspect of their Aspect a battle hardened veteran vastaya can go even. If fighting any other ascended instantly lose with no contest.

You will definitely feed multiple games dont hesitate to mute players who apparently cant understand that there are players who have not played this game for multiple years.

hmdxvpi,ElBigDicko,11/28/2021,1,282.0,That happens when teams have finally realized that players are becoming too expensive  for what they are worth. Sven isnt bad but he wasnt a top player anymore and there is no reason to pay him ridiculous amount of money to go 4th.  There is no difference between having super team and losing to LPL/LCK and qualifying for Worlds and getting shit on. You can do the latter without stacked roster just get lucky with foreign rookies.

hmdnjmn,DupreeWasTaken,11/28/2021,1,1204.0,I dont think theres been any clear indication NA salaries went up in 2021 looks like the opposite IMO - I know someone was talking about that maybe Travis?   Also NA viewership is odd I wont pretend to know the exact figures but in that recent twitch leak the LCS made much more money on twitch ads alone that LEC did despite LEC having more viewers which indicates to me the LCS gets better return on their ads. - If i had to guess maybe the US market is just more highly prized? Dunno.

More teams will likely not fix that. And more teams would likely not make NA a better region. Theres already enough low end garbage teams in NA that have no asperations to actually do anything.  Honestly more teams might even just make the situation worse because more teams would be throwing money on these players that realistically are not worth it at all.

hmdh6fv,IlDaydreamIl,11/28/2021,1,,Funny how you assume I got caught by the hook when it seems you didnt even see the death recap in the screenshot. Ashe ulted me THEN Blitz hooked me. I didnt galeforce because that Ashe ult looked like it was gonna hit the person in front of me. Turns out hitboxes worked wonders and it passed him so it hit me.  Even then you say he wouldnt kill me 1v1 in a million years? Ive had it happen MULTIPLE TIMES in lanes that I kill enemy adc while my supp is locking him down and a Leona solo kills me while I do that for example. Its really funny opening death recap and seeing 100 dmg from enemy adc and 700-800 dmg from a Leona with 1 supp item/component. (And yes Ive done that AS Leona too. Just in case you say there is no way. Leona has that dmg she has been having it for a long time nobody ever complained about her.)  As for what you say about the advantage in adc Ive killed adcs with 1 more item than me and Ive been killed by adcs with 1 less item than me. That can be relative to skill. An Ezreal with 1 more item can be killed easily if you dodge his Qs and W. A Vayne with 1 more item can be killed easily if you coordinate well with your supps cc and time it right. And/or exhaust. Just 2 examples there are many more.

I don’t think you can call whatever bout Vi’ll have with Sett a “fight” He wins hands down. Even without his Vastayan magic he’s like 3x her size and a capable accomplished fighter. Vi is pretty much just a thug and the most fighting she’s had is a few street fights here and there.

The management on TSM for the past three years has been absolutely awful.

hmddhzi,ngd33,11/28/2021,1,,How was DL playing bad? I suggest you take a look at the vods from his point of view. His game 2 was nearly perfect up until sniper inted with his tp mid and gave baron. And game 3 was doomed from the start. There was multiple times dl was trying to tell the team to rotate to an objective and instead the youngsters just kinda wandered in different directions leaving him trying to defend vital objectives alone. I would say dl was hindered by young players but it was for fun anyways. Ik your going to probably say he got caught game 1 multiple times but lulu should have taken the e on the first death and failed to shield him before damage landed. And later the Baron facecheck death was a hard situation. He tried to get his team to help but they went side lanes for some reason. He did so much damage in fights and positioned really well for the most part. His flashes were great and even had some nice dodges with his galeforce. I think if he was on a team right now he would surprise a lot of people who doubted him in his final split.

hmduaai,lenbeen,11/28/2021,1,1.0,hmm if its a matter of precision and playing smart all while having the better aim and knowledge of resources  i would suggest top lane as bruisers and tanks fall into that role quiet often. top lane is a place where the smarter laner will come out ahead going for pokes timing fights properly and above all else managing your minions so the enemy has a harder time. off the top of my head i dont think any champs play like Spartans do but there are definitely champs that play like your playstyle in PvP  you could check out [Aatrox](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/champions/aatrox/) \- he has a very timely combo that takes a lot of patience to learn more or less you want to land his moves in a specific order as hitting his Q at a certain point will yield more damage and a knockup. he is also a very good dueler due to his life steal and skill ceiling making him very fun and fits the precision playing patiently quota you want for a Halo-esque champ  alternatively you could look at [Shen](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/champions/shen/) \- he is a little different he has a lot more all-in potential where you basically want to lock down one opponent. his Q buffs your auto attacks but it places a spiritual sword where you cast it. if you want someone you can plan ahead with Shen can place his sword somewhere that gives you an advantage since when it passes through an an enemy champion you gain more damage and slow the enemy too. he is a lot more patient though as you dont have much to harass your enemy with and your abilities cost Energy and not Mana which regenerates faster over time but you have less of it. he comes into late game much better but offers a *huge* amount of patience precision *and* looks badass while doing it. also he is a masked ninja with a skin that has an alternate color scheme... [the top right one](https://www.mobafire.com/images/champion/skins/chromas/shen-psyops.jpg)  last one for top lane [Fiora](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/champions/fiora/) \- its always a fine line between people calling her *broken beyond repair* and *easy to learn hard to master*. i think she is stupid strong as she comes into late game really aggressively and can do an insane amount of damage if you let her she is hard to learn though. shes super mobile later on and can poke the enemy in lane very easily. her W negates all damage and crowd control from enemy abilities but has a long cooldown so mistiming it could lose you the fight. timing it perfectly though is such a satisfying feeling as any CC the enemy applies to you during the animation gets applied back so long as you hit them with the area of your W. she is a hyper duelist and excels in taking 1v1s with the enemy team

Not everyone is going to think the shows you watch are great animation wise. People have different opiions. I mainly watch animated shows for the story and entertainment value but 2d animation is just not my thing animation wise. 3d animation will usually always be my prefered animation style and this show is one of the best at it.

hmdlk0j,Lawbakgoh,11/28/2021,1,,I started playing ranked by myself around level 40 or so.  It was at the beginning of season 11 and I remember not being able to win a ranked game for a while because the play style was a lot different.  I switched roles shortly after and wanted to learn Volibear jungle.  I didn’t do too well jungling in the beginning.  I was around bronze 3 but then I climbed to bronze 2 before heading down to iron 3.  I remember getting a demotion shield which essentially was a warning that I was going to go to iron.  One game I left frustrated and got a penalty.  But I just stuck with jungling and then got a duo partner when I was in iron.  It got me back to bronze.  From there I played by myself and got some more duo partners and got to silver.  I can hold my own now but I still like duo partners who I believe are reliable and compatible with my playstyle.    I was definitely carried by my team mates and duo partners early but there is definitely an improvement.    Either way if new players are indeed starting in iron that’s the right thing to do.  I just thought many started high bronze like me or low silver (which I think is too high for a new player.)

hme3ato,Party-47,11/28/2021,1,239.0,I think you are exaggerating a bit in the other direction he wasnt great by anymeans but he had some decent showings.  Results wise: Got fourth in his first split with FlyQuest (both regular season and playoffs) summer was bad got 9th. Had a chance to play in the gauntlet and did lose first round but their first round opponent also ended up beating everyone and going to worlds (Clutch).  Next year (2020) spring is pretty good again - finshed fourth. Was replaced at the very end of the split and didnt end up playing much of playoffs but the regular season fourth was something he was a part of.  Looking at his stats individually: Really good cs/m and low death counts. A bit on the lower side of Killpart% which goes hand in hand with the other two tidbits (and notably Solo who replaced him was the polar opposite here he had high deaths and very high killpart% so the replacement can be seen as more of a style difference rather than a strict upgrade though I think solo was better overall).  Assuming he was on the weakerside of his team he also had really good effects on PB for his teams. For example in 2020 Spring Regular Season Riven was banned 9 times against him (out of 15 games) despite the fact that noone at all was playing her (Viper himself played her once and won the game 8-0-5). It shouldnt be underestimated how positive it is to make your enemies ban something they objectively shouldnt be banning.  He was never one of the stronger LCS toplaners but even if he was a lower tier toplaner if there arent any better ones that could replace him it still means he was LCS caliber. And when he played we also had sOAZ ruining his legacy and Ruin ruining something in the League. Then there was Allorim/Dhokla on Optic and Darshan/FallenBandit on CLG none of which looked too hot either if memory serves so I dont think he was ever even a definitive worst toplaner in the league.

hmeb36g,Xonra,11/28/2021,1,702.0,Its easier to tier list power but specifically speaking of ones that could deal with not just Viego but the mist  Obviously A Sol and Bard as celestials though Zoe is right up there with them even though she isnt necessarily considered one. Soraka was technically a celestial but she isnt quite the same tier anymore though she has to be mentioned.  The strongest people that arent straight up gods Id say has to go to Brand and Ryze then you have to start looking at say Anivia and Xerath and the tiers start getting muddied cause who is strong may not be good against Viego specifically and by themselves cause you have to take the mist into account as thats pretty much the whole reason hes relevant.  Like Aatrox is strong and would wreck Viego but not so much when you factor in the mist if he was by himself it wouldnt work out most likely. Yorick however is full on amassing his own army of souls he is siphoning from the mist and so on for a while and continues to do so. He got done dirty (more than people realize) in the Sentinel story. He could go head to head with Viego and is literally his main story rival.  The aspects in general are incredibly strong but solo they wouldnt be able to do much against the Viego shenanigans. Maybe two together like say if Kayle and Morgana teamed up (even though they are more ex-aspects but they are still on that level of strength). There are a few youd have an argument for like Kindred is is essentially death. Nocturne is arguable in the right situation as he could very well take out Viego and ignore the mist potentially. My third honorable mention would probably be Syndra cause shes gotta be one of the strong mages outside of Ryze/Brand/Xerath and not sure she isnt above Xerath

In the end I run PTA like 75% of the time rn - and use the early game to pivot my build. Because if I commit to hail of blades but dont get fed enough early game then im absolutely useless later. PTA can serve a similar purpose but still feel ok if I need to go to a less aggressive build.

hmdzykv,Lawbakgoh,11/28/2021,1,29.0,My understanding of the system was that you play 10 placement games and that determines your starting point.  I did not duo or play with friends up until that point and started in bronze 3/bronze 2.  Looking back I think that’s too high.  I just played with someone else who just did 10 placement games and was placed in bronze 1.  He went 0/14 in his last match.  I think he is starting too high too and the placement system needs a rework:    I did not duo or play with friends in my original placement of bronze 3/2.  I did however start playing with friends and duoing after I dropped a lot and was in iron.  They were in silver when I was high iron/low bronze.  They definitely carried those games.

You have riftmaker and nashors. You stop losing trades. Youre broken. You still somehow int. You deserve to be flamed at that point.  Same thing goes for like any adc who builds cringebow or a hyper carry assassin like Kassawin katarina etc. Youre abusing broken shit thats not hard to play and just.... fucking it all up.   tldr matchmaking and general playerbase is cringe
hmdhx7s,Lawshow,11/28/2021,1,,That’s not really it at all.   With their strength in solo queue you are either good enough to climb or bad enough to get stuck. Hypercarries tend to attract people who want to play micro intensive champions. After enough playtime they get good enough at vayne/yasuo/etc that you climb because you also have good macro or you get stuck because you have bad macro and try to take every 1v5 you see.

hmdyg72,AnexoDeContrato,11/28/2021,1,4.0,Your ranked games will still sffrct your mmr (if you dont know mmr its basically your real elo if you are silver ii but your mmr is like gold i you will win tons of lp and lose just a few bit if you are gold i but your mmr is like silver ii you will win few points and lose tons of it).  So why to play ranked on preseason? If you want to get the mmr of the account higher. And when you should want to do this? When the mmr is so low so you have nothing to lose. If the mmr is balanced or even so high playing ranked on preseason (which is a really circus) will  be a bad idea 90% of the times because you probably will lose mmr.  But if you have an account with poor mmr you have nothing to lose and you probably will be playing against people with worst elo than you.
hmdm8hm,mivaad,11/28/2021,1,111.0,depends on whether vi has her gauntlets
hme0zmj,blueripper,11/28/2021,1,190.0,Sett is a magic being in a world full of magic beings and Vi isnt one of them. She got her face pounded by Sevika so I assume that she cant dodge punches from a dude thats much faster than that.  What would even make Vi faster that Sett? We know that hes a lot faster than a regular human and hes also a hardened pit fighter (with a lot more experience than Vi).   Also most of Vis defence is based around her face blocking hits and that might not be a viable strategy versus Sett.
hmdt9eb,resttheweight,11/28/2021,1,151.0,Isn’t the idea behind cosplay to take a fictional character and try to make accurate reflections of them as if the character actually existed in reality? What’s the point of cosplay if you take and edit pictures so heavily that they are more of a digital recreation than a picture of the outfit?  Photography can also both be a form of art and a reflection of reality. There are also infinite degrees of how much a photo can be edited. There’s a difference between editing an original photo where the photograph itself is the intended object for observation vs editing photos that are intended to just be a medium for viewing the “actual” piece of art.

hmdh0f5,ENVYX0,11/28/2021,1,10.0,Yes imo everything is balanced ( maybe not now cuz pre season and pre season IS NEVER BALANCED ) but overall yes champs are 100% overloaded but that dosent make them OP. Gwen is great well designed champ riot distrubutes the power budget farily well throught the abilities most of viegos power is in his R and his passive when u Q and W that procs his passive after you auto which is most of his dmg besides R. But even then he has counterplay and riot is trying theyre best to make all champs viable in all elos which further makes shit balanced if you an climb with any champ no champs weak if you ever think a champs OP learn a champ that counters them people will pick the worst possible champ into something then cry that theyre Op like bro learn to counter pick one tricks are bad about this like hey I picked yasuo into vex man champs OP like no shit u dash 12 times and she gets her passive every time pick a champ with good waveclear/poke against yas and he gets fucked ( akali annie etc ) but if u play xerath where u rely on your E to not die and he wind walls it no shit ur probably fucked champs have counterpicks even if they seem op and that alone makes them balanced bc even if ur better u can still beat the champ that counters you.

On top of that the guantlet only does 2 things: punch hard and shield. Vi has no control of the magic past that.  While they both possess something magical Sett’s magic is adaptable. Vi’s is not.

hmdgw4w,Random_act_of_Random,11/28/2021,1,,> Youre saying the most popular of anything is inherently the actual best or even just good for that matter? Do you think marvel movies are the peak of cinema too?  What determines best or good? It seems like the for lack of better term best way to decide is to go by something that is quantifiable... such as total downloads or time listened.   >Do you think marvel movies are the peak of cinema too?  If more people pay to go to them than any other movie than yes. They are the best since the goal of cinema is to make money.  >The cowboys havent been the best NFL team in decades Lakers have been the best NBA team once in a decade. Popular doesnt mean its good.  But we have a way to determine who is the best here... the game itself. Score. But music isnt a game there is no scoreboard so there needs to be something else.  >You know who has really good food? Mcdonalds because theyre so popular!  Guess so. But obviously not counting for availability here. Once again food /= music.   Essentially all music is just as available as any other music if its online. The same cannot be said for MCDs Vs other food places.  Your arguments are weak at best. All uploaded music is just as available as any other music and yet somehow more people chose to listen to Imagine Dragons in 2018 than ANY other band on the planet. Yet according to you they suck. So tell me... what is it that you know that billions of others dont?  Or is it maybe. Just maybe. They dont fit YOUR preference for music and that has nothing to do with their overall quality.

hme1hr9,Doblelariat,11/28/2021,1,,you are kidding right? most if not everyone of the melee champions have either a dash or a hook and on some cases like Thresh Pyke Nautilus have both the ones that struggle not getting this on their kit or at least not on the same way are juggernautss but they already have a way to bypass this my point being that its more factible for a targeted ranged character to die first before getting max stacks as the melee champions just enter with these skills and cc you hard enough to dont being able to auto attack and the only case where you can actually stack them is on a teamfight where you are not focused

Its more realistic/feasible to compare for 100 mr at third item.

hmduy26,Prackinhoff11,11/28/2021,1,73.0,If your trying tempo I highly recommend trinity vs squishy targets and Devine vs more tanks/bruiser comps.  Just know that you outscale a lot of champs but Skarner is dog shit from behind. So just focus on keeping your lanes stable and farming as much as possible. Skarners fast clear speed will slowly get you a level lead.  I always max Q for much faster dragons and heralds. This also forces fights on your spire. Most players don’t realize these basically double your dps (from autos). Full clear twice > buy sheen boots sweeper control ward > run to drag and get it for free 90% of the time @ lv5 with 3 points in Q. You can take this extremely fast by yourself

hmduw17,RealRadya,11/28/2021,1,,This is pretty much it. This compounds when you spam a bunch of games in a row.

This can happen several games in a row and it’s super easy to get frustrated and tilted this way.

hme475u,itsCarmot,11/28/2021,1,,Concentrate on learning one role to a decent level at first and then follow up with the others (its unfortunate youve got jungle).   Just get over the first couple games it only gets easier from there. Mute chat if you feel like you need it. If you want you can look for guides or gameplay to get a better idea ofhow the game works and what every role is supposed to do.  Specifically for jungle: Taking a champion vs a strong ult for ganking (like nocturne or ammumu) may help to give you a good idea when to gank: when you have ult. This is obviously vastly simplified (there are other times when you should gank and sometimes where you should clear your camps first) but might help as a starting point.
hmdpat4,SterbenVII,11/28/2021,1,248.0,C9 probably still would’ve lost to Fnatic even if they had Smoothie. Zeyzal was bad in lane but he was fine afterwards and was a primary shot caller for C9.   Bwipo shitstomped Licorice and Caps outperformed Jensen. On top of that C9’s bot lane was getting a rail shoved up their ass. C9 definitely would’ve had a stable bottom lane if Spring 2018 form Smoothie was playing though.   Sven was probably better than Broxah given that the latter seemed to be micromanaged but he can’t do jack shit with 3 losing lanes.  Fnatic also had more discipline a more diverse champion pool and better macro.

Next can someone post one of these for Syndra? She could really use it with the inconsistencies of her Q E when you Q too close to yourself!
hmdt8tg,erazemcuculovic,11/28/2021,1,3.0,No you cant cuz Riot is dumb. You can refund skins but ther is no way to exchange. Would be nice to have that as an option tho wouldnt it?
hmdpn2g,NoFlayNoPlay,11/28/2021,1,40.0,ofc kda isnt the reason youre doing bad but its a good indicator that youre getting picked off too much especially on a champion like caitlyn whos supposed to play from long range and be safe.  you say getting hit is inevitable but if you galeforced and flashed but got hit by e anyways that sounds like you definitely could have avoided it.  the thing is that realistically a tank cant survive focus fire for the 7.5 seconds it takes for them to kill a squishy unless he has help and most of the time hell be hit by a lot of cc himself.  i dont think you really understand how items work either because the zac cant really build more damage than this or hell just instantly die. hes a melee champion that has to commit to going in. of course hell do more base damage and as a tank his damage barely scales with offensive items. this also means that after midgame his damage will fall off really hard and he jsut has to be as much of an inconvenience as he can by tanking and ccing for very long. but in this stage of the game glass cannons like marksmen and mages dont have enough levels to survive the base damage numbers of tanks and can get 1v1d by them. meanwhile if the tank isnt ahead by about a full item carries especially adcs will get way more value from items than anyone else because they have multiplicative scaling though ad as crit chance and damage and armor pen meanwhile tanks can only build hp and resists.

An abridged version of the story is in Ryzes backstory and the destruction of that area started the Rune Wars.

hmdnmy2,ANyTimEfOu,11/28/2021,1,165.0,Hoping they increase the number of games teams play in Group Stage. Spending a full year competing to only get six games to prove yourself must be frustrating and nerve-racking.  Even if it doesnt actually benefit NA (larger sample size makes fluke upsets less likely) I feel like group stage is often too short to get a real feel for how good teams really are. The fact that teams can go 1-1 against each other and not even get a deciding match (barring tiebreakers) is really frustrating.

hmdjvl2,aereiaz,11/28/2021,1,145.0,So many absolutely trash takes on Bwipo vs Sn1per with everyone ignoring the most important fact when youre looking at these games: Sn1pers champ was blind picked every single round and Bwipo got to choose the matchup. Shen Vs Camille for instance is heavily Shen favored in the early 1v1 AND in cross-map plays which is why Shen is often picked as a counter to Camille. Jayce does very poorly vs tanks as well. In fact Jayce has a 40% winrate against Mundo in high elo.   If youre really gonna judge the guy against Bwipo he should at LEAST get the counterpick in a single round. I think people here must be absolutely clueless about how top lane works and how devastating getting counter-picked there can be.   He definitely fucked up and made some mistakes and Id agree that Bwipo is better but you SERIOUSLY have to take into consideration that Bwipo was given counter-pick in EVERY single round. If he didnt win the lane then somethings wrong.

hmdeo06,eXgamerEx,11/28/2021,1,12413.0,The events of the plot were solid but I was surprised to find that I was rather dissatisfied with the ending. I do feel like the cliffhanger was a bit lazy and all that but I think the bigger problem lies in the **last montage**.   I think the idea for the last montage was to build suspense for the bomb hitting the council and to loosely tie things together for a conclusion but I feel that there was an opportunity wasted to let the weight of the events themselves carry the conclusion. The last sequence of slo-mos distracted from the power of the scene at the table with Jinx and ironically the events in the council chamber and its a real shame. The montage has a cheesiness to it that also spoils the significance of the events. Maybe its just my disposition toward stark endings that have little wind down from the climax. I would love to hear your opinions.   Also anyone wholly team Jinx here? No one is perfect here and she may be the least perfect here but Im wholeheartedly on her side. Maybe it was her voice acting!

hmdl898,DupreeWasTaken,11/28/2021,1,,I could be wrong. But Im pretty sure Mundo absolutely shits on Jayce actually. Not using it as a full excuse but just saying that I dont think thats a good matchup for Jayce.   Could be wrong for pro play but Mundo has a 60% winrate into Jayce in soloque and Jayce primarily keeps safe by Hammer Eing into kiting cant do that into mundo - he immunes the E and runs you down.
hmdteeb,_gr1m,11/28/2021,1,18.0,I have no issue with playing another champion I have a good pull of them. The problem for me is that things changed seemingly overnight with no apparent reason. As I said I am not usually very stats savvy I look at the change list Riot provides but I only read about new items and if one of my mains is buffed or nerfed.   I wrote this post because I really enjoy playing Shaco I can honestly say I have not had this much fun playing LoL and I play the game since 2014. It is strange to me how I used to harass everybody in the first 5 minutes of the game just relying on base stats and now I find myself not being able to out damage or keep up with the farm notoriously slow starters like Yi Viego or Gragas. I name these 3 champs in particular because I had my most successful games ever against each one of them.    Anyways. I guess this dip is nothing to do with Shaco in particular but it has accumulated with the small changes to items base stats runes etc. that the new season put on the table. And the poor clown is just a casualty of the circumstances.  But like you said LoL is LoL. There are a few champions that are just always meta and then there are champions like Yorick who almost get lost into the void due to changes. I am waiting for the day when Lux will lose the ability to stun multiple people at once or the duration of her stun will be reduced.... Just like Shacos boxes got reduced in dmg and his blink got shorter in time. Spoiler alert...aint gonna happen :D

IMO its good that LT is being used on melee characters beforehand it was only really used on a couple of ADCs and nocturne... now it has some diversity.

hme9abz,00Dandy,11/28/2021,1,39.0,Infuriating is an exaggeration. The fog is fine imo. Although it could be improved. Rengar is kinda fucked for example.  The soul is too strong compared to the other souls imo but Im sure theyll adjust it.  We are in pre-season after all. This is where Riot makes big changes. And often they can only really evaluate them on the live server because PBE data doesnt always hold true with the main playerbase.

hmdvj9t,_Karmageddon,11/28/2021,1,303.0,I played a game last night where ADC left @ 3 mins tilted managed to hold out till 25 mins where I could start carrying Teamfights 4v5 and we were very likely to win.  Some situations you just cant contest and enemy team ended up with Chem Soul now it was 4v10.   Our teamfight success IMMEDIATLY disappeared and they rolled over us.  This Dragon Soul has the same value as Baron or Elder yet is a persistent game long buff with no cooldown.  Like who actually came up with this better yet who signed off on it? You would literally have to be high or Brightmoon Bronze 2 to this was a good idea.

hmdvs1y,Scrinwarrior,11/28/2021,1,171.0,“Vi is lighter” -> weaker.  “Faster” -> Nope. We already covered why this isn’t true. Simply being human makes her slower by default.  “Harder to hit” -> Sevika didn’t seem to have any problems landing a blow on her. It’s like Vander said: Her defense game sucks.  “Her gauntlets improve her movespeed” -> No they don’t. She can use the power of the gauntlet to hurl herself forward but this is not the same as making HER faster. If anything hurling herself around like that makes her movements predictable just like in the game. When she throws herself with the power of the gauntlets she ONLY moves in a straight line. It’s a dead fucking giveaway to anyone where she is gonna be in a second.  Sett’s magical nature gives him every bonus Vi has and NONE of the drawbacks. He has increased strength without relying on a weapon that can be broken or taken from her like Sevika did. He is faster and more mobile without his movements being predictable and obvious. And he is durable once again without needing a weapon that can be broken or taken from him.   He has everything she has and none of the downsides.

hme5dnh,liamera,11/28/2021,1,72.0,For this reason I wish that the % pen items (particularly the AD ones idk about void staff) were reverted back to % bonus armor/mr penetration. Ignoring 50% of the enemys bonus armor was huge against tanks but almost a complete waste of gold against carries. This meant that building last whisperer was a meaningful build choice.  Riot has long since abandoned this in favor of the current situation where a champion can have their cake and eat it too where building seryldas doesnt even feel that bad into a mostly squishy comp because the %armor is still pretty good against squishies and it comes with other stats like the slow passive and AH so you barely even feel punished when you build it early.

hmdovi0,Linyoa,11/28/2021,1,2.0,Its got the lowest pickrate of the 3 noonquiver items and its not surprising why tbh. Were in a very bursty meta ADC need krakens shield + sustain or Galeforces mobility (not to mention picks) for survival more than they need krakens DPS especially when its intended as an anti tank item and the only anti tank item an ADC really needs is LDR these days.  Dont get me wrong I dont think its weak but cringebow is far stronger overall imo.

hmdvkkj,wontonsoupsucka,11/28/2021,1,211.0,If the 2019 TL team couldn’t make it out of groups though... I mean that was the best lineup in NA history and it’s not even close. They had the best player in NA history in 4/5 positions and then Jensen who’s the 2nd best in NA history but has the best international results... and they still didn’t make it out of groups.  Cloud 9 has devil magic going on and make it out whenever it makes no sense for them to do so but other than them the only time NA has ever made it out was TSM in S4 when Sven got banned.
hmdv1is,WallaSays3z,11/28/2021,1,212.0,No the rule is not fine since you now see 5 imports teams which is terrible for the league. There s a reason many other leagues in other sports have rules to prevent this to happen. And the reason is that the minors league below starve if none invest in their players.

hmdm4dm,SadPiccolo7701,11/28/2021,1,18.0,You got me. I dont necessarily have to win a 1v1 with sett because I main sett when i play top and I know his mechanism. I just dont like his w which only have less than 20 second cd and works like an ult. Sett w is overbuffed in a lot different ways especially on its hp-percentage-damage which means he can do half tank half melee and deal 1900 damage to a adc when using his ult engaging the fight. Also when i play as a jungler sett can always push his lane and not worrying my gank because by stacking his conquer and soloq my top laner he can definitely 1v2. Any other champs who dear to push must take a risk of gank but not sett

This Tristana bought a support item then stole all my farm never warded made a practice of engaging after I either died or escaped only to die herself then spent the rest of the game flaming me for not playing safe enough and reported me for inting. I tried one time to ask her if I could please get my own CS since I dont have a support item to give me gold and her response was to ask me why I suck at League.  I think this is the only game Ive ever intentionally afked. I was already kinda tired and tilted then I get auto filled adc and manage to put up with 30 minutes of this before I finally snapped.
hmdftre,theelementalflow,11/28/2021,1,197.0,Like I said Its hard to jungle with Jizuke vs having someone like Jensen or Bjergsen who consistently win lane. Look at Blabber for example when he has Nisqy or Perkz. Its easier to jungle when your laners have prior if you even watch competitive at all.

I say its mediocre so it must be a bait you say its good so my opinion is deemed wrong?  I dont even want to agrue you love the show fine i dont. Leave it at that.
hme9h4x,SILVER5893,11/28/2021,1,241.0,Without gauntlets - ofc Sett. With gauntlets - Vi favored.

hmeil2e,chanyeoIs,11/28/2021,1,16.0,I think this was done just for promo and Riot doesnt actually plan to make it canon. We also had [these teasers](https://youtu.be/jKkTcGIsa4U) where he kills 4 champions. I dont think any of them will actually die and especially after the huge success of Arcane Vi is safe. I do hope he will appear in the show though but thats for a much later season
hmeji7q,KBSinclair,11/28/2021,1,12420.0,You can always tell more stories with a posthumous character. Either from before their death or with how their death affects orhers. Story death doesnt mean throwing a character away. And League can just continue using them in all the alt skins they want.

hmdow7v,DupreeWasTaken,11/28/2021,1,485.0,Maybe it is I dont know what the challenger players feel on it yet. But tbh I havent really had an issue with Conq since nerf when i feel its needed but Im mostly PTA atm - which looks like statistically Conq is highest winrate lowest pickrate then PTA then LT.   But you do hit a good point in that it could be playstyle. I play full crit one shot kindred usually with a galeforce to compensate the chase bit. Because of that maybe sitting back and waiting 6 autos to have a rune just isnt my thing and because I usually rush boots into a galeforce I cover the chasing people down thing pretty well overall - hell at the end of last season in very specific circumstances (squishy immobile carries and I was fed enough to make the decision after rushing zerkers - I rushed a ghostblade to just run down and 3 shot people)   With Conq i do run usually something like Kraken/PD/IE though and play a bit more auto heavy which should play into LT builds. So I dunno why I just dislike it more.
hmdzru3,Brief_Energy_1495,11/28/2021,1,17.0,Anyways shows can have character develop and such. The game can go on the same but the show can deviate and add more to the characters. Jinx lines were created way earlier than Ekko’s and it’s clear now that there could be something more
hme3eav,delayedride,11/28/2021,1,43.0,If he doesnt trust you and deems it a waste of time farming is the correct choice for him. The jg works with 3 lanes while you have to only worry about yourself and occasional roam there are many things that might make him not show up.

hme1gth,1nc000,11/28/2021,1,19.0,Because there’s no correct way to get rid of them.  Players will always find a way to wiggle themselves in low elo lobbies.

hmdjnzi,IlDaydreamIl,11/28/2021,1,36.0,I said it a few times in other replies but anyways: It was 4 seconds of actual combat and 3 seconds of me running away. Still whats exactly your point? We are talking about 2400 dmg in 4 seconds from a tank with a single dmg item. I dont think thats healthy at all for the game thats all.
hmeanwp,supadankgreen420,11/28/2021,1,34.0,Oof. I know Burdol is supposed to be a promising talent but it’s still a massive downgrade from Khan/Nuguri. We’ll probably see DK come into 2022 with a completely new identity which is more bot-focused. Showmaker and Canyon need to make it work with Deokdam/Kellin if they’re going to defend their title from GEN and T1.
hme2pc1,1nc000,11/28/2021,1,2.0,Morgana is basically the “cc” champion along with Leona and she can be flexed in mid/support/jungle.  Lux as you mentioned is one of the best performing midlaners currently and her kit is and has been stable for many years now.  If you want to play more tanks champions with cc there’s Sejuani Tahm etc
hmdkhnk,Exmerus,11/28/2021,1,236.0,He was questionable. Started decently for a few games decayed later. But lets not forget the game when his team literally robbed him a scuttle that was his 4th Kindred mark in a really close game for no fucking reason. He was permatilted for the rest of the season after that game lmao. I can see him improving this year to become average at least.

hme75s8,SirWobblyOfSausage,11/28/2021,1,7.0,You could try something like [Blitz.gg](https://Blitz.gg) \- It can import runes and items from highest winrates to pro players games. Try lots on Practice Tool and see what works for you.      Once you learn what each item can do and when to get them you can customise your builds on the fly. Just takes practice.      Ive been playing for 10+ years now still plenty to learn and try out.

Yeah but I feel like Corina is so well-known by so many people at this point and giving such big hints in roadmap about her would be legit just riot confirming that Corina is the champ and there would be no wow and shock factor once she gets released because ***omg it was so obvious***     I deeply hope its not her because we already have a plant-flower support champion in a form of Zyra and we havent had a male supp champ in a while ***(last one was Pyke in 2018)*** and to be frank we still dont have a proper male enchanter in the game

hme7a4h,Dripcommander,11/28/2021,1,24.0,yeah the way the toplane pool in the LCK looks at the moment rookies are definitely the best move for top teams. there are toplaner who are good but maybe not necessarily elite tier and there are toplaner who you think could be elite tier but have not shown that recently. in any case many of the them are not available or only under very specific conditions. but there are rookies who look promising and at some point simply have to gain experience in order to grow

Worlds was in Iceland MSI was in Iceland the Worlds before that was in China MSI was skipped and Worlds before THAT (so 2019) was in EU while MSI was in Taiwan/Vietnam/SEA.  And I dont think anything from 2018 would really be useable even if Sniper had already been hight elo (which I dont think he was?).

Even if he doesnt end up in LCS it is very plausible he continues playing professionally in Academy right? He at least seems to still be looking for opportunities.

hmemlj7,SkiaElafris,11/28/2021,1,5.0,If you were to keep working on this I would say the next step is to categorize champions and then see check for the win rate correlation between the common champion picks and the categories. Then to see if the categories applied work out compare trends vs the individual champion results.  This would then give a secondary metric to help with less common champions.

hme7n4c,FeEFr97,11/28/2021,1,2.0,The purpose is to try out the new things they want to introduce so that they can balance them before the next season.  You can rank but it won’t count for you current ranking rewards and you will be reset at the beginning of next season. The mmr you gain may help you next season but I would say there really is no need to rank now of all times.

hmejahg,Scraggersmeh,11/28/2021,1,3.0,The obvious answer is playing tahm top. Hes s+ tier there. But youll have to do a lot of learning. Spending so long as support makes you worse at the game as you never learn laning fundamentals. Youve got a long road ahead of you.

hme7ugr,ruikaitang,11/28/2021,1,333.0,Probably the OG roster that went to TI8 (dota 2 worlds 2018).  Heres the quick tldr: Roster blew up shortly before the tournament due to some drama leaving them with 2/5 players. They roleswapped one of the remaining players from carry to support found a promising soloq player for their mid convinced a dude to unretire to play carry and subbed their coach in to play offlane.  In league terms this would be 2016 c9 roster blowing up so they swap hai (who was on c9c in 2016 just pretend hes on main roster) from mid to jungle grab some dude from soloq to play mid for them sub in reapered top and then getting current doublelift to play adc while keeping their support the same.   They (OG) won the whole thing.

hmeloyi,Willoh2,11/28/2021,1,7747.0,And the worst of all is that I still wonder if in the very last episode Vi is ready to accept what Jynx became now and if Silco wasnt right after all about her not being able to go on a day before realizing she is not her sister anymore.  Like did she grow up enough in her head to realize the current situation ? She is still swinging like a teenager to solve issues that arent her sister. Can she accept that anarchic cruel and uncontrollable sister of hers now even if they go on together and without treating her only like a poor child in need of help ? I want to say that yes because it would be damn depressing especially considering she spent years in prisons only thinking about her but thats a possibilty one cant rule out.

hmdvnnu,LeatherBodybuilder,11/28/2021,1,171.0,It wont even be close...  Vi is an average sized human female whose training includes some half-hearted training from Vander when she was a child and punching walls in jail.  Meanwhile Sett is a 7 foot tall half-beast man who has been training and fighting beasts and professional fighters almost his entire life.  Even just putting the massive size and experience gap aside Sett is also half-Vastaya so he is just straight up naturally above peak human speed durability and strength. Then you add in the fact that he has magic due to his Vastayan blood.

hme58na,Farler,11/28/2021,1,156.0,Sweeper + Umbral glaive + zombie Ward makes Pyke one of if not the best support at doing vision. One shotting wards lets you cover more ground and do it safer and clear wards that get placed on top of you without using any resources pretty much constantly have something to help clear wards gain zombie wards your w (and potentially ghostblade passive out of combat speed) help cover more ground your e helps you get out of a sticky situation on the off chance you do get caught out trying to clear vision (unlike an enchanter or something). That item is what makes Pyke support actually viable.

Dont go into normal games yet because you will probably get destroyed quite easy and teammates will rage you like hell (your friend screaming would be nothing compared to toxic lol comunnity!). Find yourself easy peasy champions for start which does not need tons of skill to play idk. Garen jax lux? Annie etc. Start with that and learn basics 1st what spells do what objectives (rift baron dragon) do what and how place wards basic skills passives from champion to champion map pings etc.    There are tons of begginer videos on youtube which will help you.  Bonus tip: prepare to be raged like hell you will realise that your friend screaming is like angel voice compared what you are about to hear upon summoners rift (rasist family insults are quite common). Do not get distracted!!! Simply ignore do not start arguing with any1! Stay quiet mute them and press report after game! Best actions for you to avoid conflicts and nerve breakdowns. Idk which community is more toxic gta online or lol but either way ignore it completly play your own game and thats it.  Enjoy leauge as much as you can!

hmebq9g,ApplePitou,11/28/2021,1,,Sona has no such skill so it is most likely a bug :3
hme6dzl,Psyr1x,11/28/2021,1,692.0,Lissandra is the oldest known character of mortal origins (\~9k years old). In this time shes directly impacted all of the Freljord and almost every character in it and indirectly impacted most major events in Runeterra.  She and her sisters attempted to take power from the varying realms with Lissandra at first focusing on the elemental and spiritual planes... at first failing to make much leeway she then sensed The Watchers in The Void and made a deal with them:  If she helped them make a path to Runeterra shed be revealed the underlying secrets of the world and granted power as a result.  She accepted.  This lead to crusades against the opposing forces becoming successful...  and in the attempt to thwart her ***Ivern*** travelled to Ionia and chopped down the God Willow in an attempt to harness its power to be used against The Sisters.   Instead he became a tree man and locked in place for centuries.  Back in the Freljord the sisters overtook more and more of the lands... however some form of schism occurred and Avarosa and Serylda turned against Lissandra... and in the midst of that initial clash The Watchers burst forth into Runeterra...  and Lissandra immediately sacrificed almost everyone to freeze them in a bed of True Ice.   ***Willump*** was the only Yeti to keep a fragment of magic whereas all the others went feral.  Animals with no abilities.  ***Gnar*** got trapped in the ice.  &#x200B  She is also the one to have made The Freljord such an inordinately cold place essentially terraforming an entire region.   The Freljord was always cold it being in the general northern area of the world.   However it was never *this* cold nor did it have as much snow or ice.    This is something Gnar points out when he first reawakened and writers have similarly attested to that major working Lissandra did (freezing the Watchers) having altered the climate of the region.  In the following ages Lissandra worked to stamp out the remaining Demigod Faiths and rewrite history as a result ***Ornn Volibear Anivia*** The Seal Sister Iron Boar and many others became severely weakened or outright died altogether as no memory remained of them to provide sustenance.  She also implemented herself and her sisters as the dominant faith in The Freljord known as The Faith of The Three Sisters heralded as saints/godfigures in this era.  She also made The Frostguard (her most loyal and stringent followers).  The Frostguard from there on (alongside her) has continued to influence history by keeping watch of Iceborn and even taking some should they show promise.  Theyve also interacted with ***Ashe Sejuani Braum and Udyr.***  Currently we know Lissandra is working towards fostering conflict between Sejuani and Ashe (and their factions) to ensure she keeps the Freljord under her subtle control.  &#x200B  Throughout the ages Lissandra has also invaded the dreams of countless people both in the Freljord and the wider world of Runeterra luring them to essentially feed their dreams and souls to The Watchers to keep them quiet and inert she also regularly steals energy from these dreams to sustain *herself* when she metaphysically feeds herself to a Watcher that stirs/starts becoming restless and on the verge of awakening.  You can read more in [*Hero Of The Frost Moon*](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/lissandra-color-story/)** and [*The Dream Thief*](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/dream-thief/)  She has directly sponsored ***Trundle*** in his journey of becoming the Troll King as well as directly interacted with ***Nunu*** trying to get more knowledge of where one can potentially create True Ice again.  Shes also implied to have kidnapped his mother something he doesnt know yet.  &#x200B  &#x200B  Lets go back to The Watchers and The Void which is where the rest of the connections occur.   It is *Lissandras* fault why *any* of the **Voidborn** even exist.   She betrayed The Watchers freezing the ones thatd crossed over.   The Watchers remaining in The Void recognized this  and became more wary of Runeterra (what she did as well as the nature of what happened when they crossed realms) instilled a spark of fear in them and made them think of another way to interact with Runeterra to both work towards understanding the world more and thus work towards its destruction/consumption.   This resulted in The Voidborn.  Constructs forged of Runeterran Organic Matter tasked with roaming the world and consuming. (None of the Voidborn have ever been to the void they were all created in Runeterra).  It is The Voidborn that initiated the domino effect that would result in the Fall of Shurima and the Rise of The Darkin.   This started with the great rift that opened in Icathia during the rebellion. This resulted in ***Zilean*** removing The Tower from the flow of time and ***Jax*** roaming the world teaching and gathering warriors for the coming great war.  Many Ascended died in this war and it resulted in *Ixtal* cutting off ties to the empire and retreating into the jungle hiding behind their wards and enchantments.  When Shurima finally managed to stop the effects of the Void in that area (by killing all life in that area and stopping the flow of magic there) most of the surviving Ascended were afflicted by the traumas of having closely encountered The Void and its reality unravelling powers as well as witnessing their comrades fall to gruesome deaths.  Shurima recovered but its warriors never did...  they became more and more aggressive and unhinged but managed to keep this in check until **Xerath** betrayed **Azir** and stole his Ascension before destroying the capitol.  **Nasus** then trapped Xerath and his brother **Renekton** in the tomb for millennia.  Shurimas fall resulted in the Ascended losing grip on what unified them and allowed them to fall to their PTSD and delusions of grandeur...  they became known as ***The Darkin***... and they ravaged Runeterra in the great Darkin Wars.  &#x200B  ***Janna*** protected Zaun during this time and this is what allowed the region to prosper and become so technologically advanced when compared to the rest of Runeterra.  &#x200B  Some shenanigans happened resulting in the Chalicar (now ***Sivirs*** weapon) being imbued with even more power (You can read more in [*Twilight Of The Gods*](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/twilight-of-the-gods/)) and a more reliable way of defeating the Darkin innovated.  &#x200B  It wasinthis age that ***Vladimir*** was made a servant to a Darkin in exchange for Camavors temporary protection... his master took pleasure in tormenting him but also taught him the secrets of Blood Magic and when a coup occurred he and his forces (alongside others) managed to betray and kill the Darkin.  Vladimir took in a fraction of its power and was driven mad as a result for a long time.  &#x200B  After the Darkin Wars ended Runeterra especially Valoran became a very vulnerable and fragmented region...  ***Mordekaiser*** took advantage of that and forged his empire...  one that was eventually overthrown and taken by ***LeBlanc*** and The Rose becoming the culture of Noxus as we know today...  Noxus which then ravaged *Ionia* in its invasion and the resulting actions ended up affecting many of the champions in both regions.  &#x200B  There are some other connections that can be made from there... For example:   * Implications that Shurima and Ascension was pioneered in the first place to make an army against The Void.     * Sol being summoned to close a rift spilling voidborn then subsequently banished from Runeterra for millennia for having managed to slip out of the Aspects control for a few moments.  But the things I listed are the major Direct and Indirect examples of Lissandras influence in the history of Runeterra.

hmdi4m4,hasuuser,11/28/2021,1,39.0,The game is better without 2k games 48% wr players first timing champions. I don’t care about dodges. But I do care about quality of the games.
hmeo20j,arg_max,11/28/2021,1,31.0,The item is not bad but its competing directly with some of the best items in the game. Steraks death dance and Black cleaver are all super good unless you need that waveclear and sustain hydra is just a tad worse. Especially since Goredrinker already has an active ability for clear and vamp. Against tanks and juggernauts champs like riven just need armor pen or theyll start to have serious problems in the 1v1 which hydra cant solve. The two main users fiora and Camille that rush it second have so much true damage that is less of a problem for them. I could see buying it on Riven against like a Yone where I dont need early pen but even then deaths dance is probably just the better item.
hmdebyw,MapPotential9009,11/28/2021,1,3.0,I think a lot of the toxicity comes down to really poor matchmaking by Riot. This preseason has been hell to play because of how bad the matchmaking is. There is a clear and massive difference between skill levels among enemies and teammates its beyond titling.
hmdufon,pannucci,11/28/2021,1,200.0,its hard to say V1per is LCS tier. He was completely bottom of the table when he played in LCS and has never gotten a chance again. He is an academy level player at best really. Not to say that he cant learn anything from him but dont just rewrite history and act like his brother wasnt absolutely terrible in LCS.
hmeliii,acdxfgb,11/28/2021,1,,What laning fundamentals do you mean? when to push and when to freeze?or things like who is stronger at what stage(matchups)? things like that? im not exactly low elo and those are very important to know as a support but I agree its more up to the adc and harder to do as a support

hmencr0,KeeBoley,11/28/2021,1,4.0,1. Janna and Yuumi are still perfectly viable supports. The failure is with yourself not the champions strengths. Of course that doesnt mean you have to enjoy support. Just saying. The only one of those champions not viable as a support anymore is Tahm. Who happens to be an S+ tier Top Laner.   2. Your lack of success with other roles is almost certainly because it takes tons of time to learn a role. Youve probably spent a lot of time learning support to the level youre at now. Role swapping is a difficult process which is why tons of players dont bother. You need to pick a role and stick with it and accept that youll be worse to start. Having a small champ pool in that new role will speed up the process a bit.  3. High CC/Utility just sounds like Tanks. Enchanters dont really have a 1:1 translation with other roles besides Ivern. They are almost exclusively Supports. But CC/Utility tanks are common elsewhere. Especially Jungle/Top.   4. Imo jungle will have the most likely easiest transition. Support is essentially a second jungler in a lot of ways. Plus you wont have to learn to CS minion waves. Which is why a lot of Jungle players play support secondary.  5. Really you just need to pick the role you enjoy playing the most though. No one on reddit will be able to tell you that.

hmdl365,VisionsReal,11/28/2021,1,5.0,To summarize balancing  Everyone wants their way of playing to be the best way. Imagine if TheBausffs couldnt do his good death strat and it resulted in him just perma inting and losing games. People want their way to be good when its not they cry. Prime examples of this are ADC players if they arent absurdly broken 1v9 players with an ardent support they cry especially when they have to play APCs to not be a liability.  &#x200B  Players in SoloQ want to be stars not get carried. Theyll find any reason to complain if they arent the star.  &#x200B  Id rather take Riot biweekly patches over WoWs 9-16month patches.

hmetqfd,D3monFight3,11/28/2021,1,,He is a musician dont generalize to make them sound closer to eachother. Jhin was not a musician from what we know he was an actor in a theater.   Why does it matter if they have been at one point in Piltover?  What imagery him having a steampunk amplification device on his shoulder that looks like a Tuba does not make it the same as Jhins rifle.   Hell if you come up with crackpot theories like this Caitlyns father could be Jhin both are asian/Ionian looking lean dudes both have been in Piltover at one point both have intricate knowledge about the human anatomy and his daughter is a sniper so maybe he learned by watching her.  But it would make no sense it would not only add absolutely nothing to Jhin but it would also be kinda weird to have a tribute to Ray Chen turned into something else that is what that was about same with Imagine Dragons characters.
hmesua8,The-UnwantedRR,11/28/2021,1,701.0,Eh it’s probably because if reports were easy to send in then false reports would flood the system. It’s easy to report someone after the game but people probably won’t go through the effort of going to their website to send in fake reports. So someone can’t easily report someone over and over in the client.
hmeo58s,TheNeys,11/28/2021,1,35.0,Mages are not weak and have mostly never been in the whole LoL existance statistically speaking.   The fact is that your average silver teammate prefers picking Zed/Kata/Yasuo because MuH 1v5 cArrY once every 20 games is the best feeling they get in the game.   Truth is those silver stuck players would hit Gold in no time if they defaulted to play mages with TP waveclear and be useful but that is apparently more boring than 1v1 and killing your lane opponent (and usually failing at it and then blaming your jungler).
hmeq2ss,SkeletonJakk,11/28/2021,1,,Marked controversial.  I guess mage players just expect all their items to have minimum 100 ap and anything damage based needs 120 at the lowest.

hmex05d,StopPickingRyze,11/28/2021,1,56.0,We need timeline on this Awaken cinematic tbh.  Because Riven is imprison fighting which this happens like many years later after the Ionian vs Noxus invasion/war. We know this because of the recent Riven story.  We also know the ruined king is canon and Yasou is planning on finding Riven in Noxus.  But in the awakening trailer we clearly see Yasou fighting at this battle. This could be the second invasion that Noxus is planning and its just a battle at the shores. Since Noxus did claim some Ionian land.  I need a timeline tbh.

hmewp1r,thrownawayzs,11/28/2021,1,16.0,probably a comfortable pose to draw for the artist. take notes on how they avoided hands and below the knee entirely. the face is fairly flat compared to the dimension we get from the body. the body is certainly more muscular compared to jinx and the pose and face are out of character.  so for an outside viewer without character context its pretty solid. the colors and use of white to add depth is done well. overall its well rendered just not totally accurate.  this is ignoring any eva related stuff as well since i havent watched that in a decade.

hmevrk5,SeizeTheBeef,11/28/2021,1,77.0,Its about 1000 minutes of animation that would probably take the team 2-3 years of production with 3-4 years of development writing design world building before production starts. The team of 200 artists arent all animators many are modelling texturing rigging lighting compositing etc..  Also Fortiche arent an average French studio they employ some of the best artists and produce some of the highest quality commercial animation in France so salaries would likely be higher than average.
hmev3h2,DeleteAllWeebs,11/28/2021,1,22.0,Yi has a 52 win rate in masters not just a nice try Yi is currently a problem in high elo and hes supposed to be a low elo stomper that falls off the higher you go.
hme5j4x,Scarnest9,11/28/2021,1,19.0,I wonder what direction DK have gone for.   - Nuguri is taking a break - Canna is signed to NS  - TheShy will stay in LPL  There aren’t any good top laners left which matches DK goal to continue to win LCK and contend for MSI and worlds.  Could it be that they play with sub top in spring with the return of Nuguri after he has had some time off ?

hmevqim,delahunt,11/28/2021,1,748.0,That has less to do with Ryze being the main character and more to do with Ryze being Fakers signature champ even more so then Leblanc was when he was undefeated on it.

You spend money to win you sacrifice immediate results to save money and develop cheaper prospects so that you can win in the future.  Spend now - win never is not a fucking business model. It took LCS teams way too long to figure that out. You either spend now - win now or save now - win later.

If he doesnt perform in the lower leagues he might stagnate and currently off his 3 champs he looks really really lackluster.  If youre looking lackluster in amateur and academy then you arent going to progress onwards. And considering how much cash he can make from streaming if he stagnates he will likely go be a streamer.

hmew06w,OkamiGames,11/28/2021,1,6.0,And one of the reasons for this is the platinum player as he would rather go easy 20/0 against Iron players instead of trying hard and playing on their elo. In the lower elos the new players are more likely to be who do not yet have the understanding of the game and the skills and who quickly stop when they just get pissed off by smurf. So either he just wants to play bot games against noobs and then feel crazy or his elo is boosted
hmemuev,Grumahr,11/28/2021,1,18.0,wait what? its not about other characters its about the ones that are in the actual game we obviously know wich ones are in the game and if these can never die there is no risk you always know they survive no matter what happens and that makes a show worse in my opinion
hmekswu,DANKKlNG,11/28/2021,1,304.0,In theory it is. But in reality its not.  Grappling takes a lot if muscle and strength. While striking doesnt. You dont need a whole lot of power to ko someone via a chin shot. And the whole idea behind bjj is that someone with more skill can overpower a bigger less skilled enemy. But if both have skill the bigger guy wins.  And grappling doesnt have any moves that allow you so finish a fight without much effort unlike striking that allows you to ko people with (as i mentioned) a chin shot or a temple shot.

hmevx23,Alibobaly,11/28/2021,1,382.0,Middle of the pack LCS is completely and utterly meaningless though. At this point Im genuinely curious if viewers believe theres a difference between finishing 10th and 4th? You genuinely accomplish nothing by getting 4th and below and the only silver linings are whatever assets you developed for the following year (hence EG finishing 5th but building on their new assets like Danny). A full team of veterans that doesnt finish top 3 has developed 0 new assets for the following year and accomplished nothing while spending a lot of money along the way.  Building a roster of veterans that peaks middle of the pack is genuinely worse than trying out some rookies and potentially building towards a higher peak in the future.
hmetveb,Lake9009,11/28/2021,1,6.0,After you understand the basics of the game I recommend playing ARAM.   It’s a gamemode that gives everyone a random champion each game. Playing this mode will help you learn what each character can do how they play and how you should play against them.   It’s also a shorter mode that most people take less seriously and therefore is less toxic overall
hme6ig2,GiganticMac,11/28/2021,1,333.0,And that’s why franchising sucks. It’s up to a bunch of fashion company CEOs whether or not these players are even allowed to compete in professional LoL. MerchShot has literally never played competitive league in any capacity yet him and the other CEOs are the ones who were given the responsibility of running the entire NA scene
hmekxno,Realnic0le,11/28/2021,1,6.0,I hit Diamond 1 solo queue only in October and havent been Plat since April.

hmesly3,homer12346,11/28/2021,1,12.0,its mostly just a problem on yasuo and yone having their Q buttons work with it that is the big issue  the range is pretty underwhelming tbh its always going to be way more impactful on ranged than melees  >Its also making Yi good in high elo when the champ tales next to no skill to play  idk what your opinion has to do with the rest of the post but to humor it yi is not only going lt in high elo about 1/4th of games is hob lethality
hmewbjs,FairlyOddParent734,11/28/2021,1,56.0,Correct me if I’m wrong isn’t the Irelia stuff in the future? It’s during the second Noxian invasion of Ionia because Karma refuses to fight during the first one?

hmesekc,Incel69420,11/28/2021,1,1.0,Had a similar bug in a way: I was playing with 2 other as a premade of 3. We got 6 honours between us at the end of the game. Riot is giving honours now?
hme7k8l,SoulMastte,11/28/2021,1,685.0,Its a giganerf because he does that since release if he doesnt get some form of compensation he becomes shit. And now its even worse as he has a ok performance on top where the buff/nerf would affect him more and a shit performance on mid where it wouldnt make difference as you said the 5 autos. But keep in note he cant kill any meta toplaner in 5 autos maybe 10 but even so he would be dead already
hmdocqw,SemanDemon22,11/28/2021,1,182.0,“You can look through the opggs of general sniper and tfblade back in the day”  What the actual f?  Back in the day?  You mean when sniper was 7?  Wtf you talking about looking at a 15 yr olds opggs from “back in the day”?  Hilarious
hmeqfdh,Suspicious-Bus6351,11/28/2021,1,69.0,Fair enough. I think Burdol is a more than fine prospect he’s getting a bad rep because of that game against Ale I feel like but Irelia into Fiora is a pretty tough match-up plus Burdol is very inexperienced. I’m still a little confused as to why GENG threw him in there.

hmeqgja,AmbushIntheDark,11/28/2021,1,,Shit the Awaken cinematic itself takes place at 3 different times.   The Irelia stuff takes place during the invasion the Jhin stuff takes place *way* after the invasion and the Riven/Draven stuff happens **right before the ruination**.
hmex9sf,leastlol,11/28/2021,1,,Yeah sadly theres no way out unless Regi himself decides to step away from the league team and they hire an actual GM that has actual power to steer the ship rather than this esports style where your star player seems to have more influence than the GM. Regi said it was basically industry standard operating procedure but how has that panned out for most of TSMs teams?
hme1f1v,SadPeggy,11/28/2021,1,9.0,Gotcha I felt that way when they introduced the free timers but they are there regardless now and nobody even thinks about a time when they were not. So I wonder why would it be so bad to see the gold diff live?

hmewhae,TheCeramicLlama,11/28/2021,1,56.0,I would be very disappointed if Riot just stuck themselves to introducing characters only through Piltover. Jhin has an incredible story to be told in Ionia and Id hate to see it ignored.

hmdz8pf,ParkRangerRafe,11/28/2021,1,399.0,I have a legit question. I’m an idiot who plays a lot of fighting games so I spend a lot of time labbing combos in training (and have also been playing league for many years) and thus mechanically I can outdo most opponents I run into. But despite being able to outplay opponents and winning lane I still lose games overall so I’ve been floating high silver- low gold forever. Tips for closing out games with leads? I play mid primarily but have played a season and hit at least silver in every role.
hmesoqh,WarriorSnek,11/28/2021,1,327.0,I think the main exception to this is like…jax pre void. Iirc jax was able to actually stand toe to toe with the ascended even back then before his body was void mutated
hmescd8,csudoku,11/28/2021,1,6.0,I would probably replace either Ryze or Kassadin with a stronger early game champion.
hmdsmaa,Macctheknife,11/28/2021,1,267.0,They should do what the old time baseball teams did and barnstorm at colleges around the country. There are a lot of college teams out there who would be super psyched to play against an all-star line up like that.   Granted youd have to get the members to accept a pittance for a salary but man that would be cool.

hmduwva,lovexdxdhuhxd,11/28/2021,1,,>This summer I would rate Fudge and Alphari above him and Ssumday isnt worse.  Has to be a meme right? SSumday is sharing a spot with Tenacity and Fudge isnt even a fucking top laner anymore. Stop. Stop posting stuff if you dont know what youre talking about.  Also Alphari isnt even in the LCS anymore. This has to be a copy pasta.  Edit: Dude youre actually posting shit on this subreddit like you know what youre talking about. Whenever you dont even know whos playing what role in the LCS and/or who isnt in the LCS anymore. Actually mentally ill.
hmdg31s,Bobofolde,11/28/2021,1,135.0,It definitely makes sense for annie since the vast majority of its power comes from the cast a giant aoe nuke. IDK how ivern R works though and the duration is definitely what matters on it
hmdv9h5,WallaSays3z,11/28/2021,1,880.0,My points is that NA orgs are all filled with imports which is terrible for the North American esport in the long run. And C9 makes little difference from other orgs. Filling teams with imports kills the sport. There s a reason many other sports in other regions have rules to prevent full import teams.

hmdxzbx,YumYumAznFood,11/28/2021,1,282.0,There are certainly draw backs to franchising however I think how Riot has approached the development league is all wrong. I rather it be its own separate league with relegation/promotion opportunities for the bottom 2 teams similar to football (soccer) or how China do it.   &#x200B  At the moment its known as the retirement squad or development league which isnt particularly attractive when it comes to bringing in views

hmensb8,Pokemon_Only,11/28/2021,1,58.0,What’s wrong with that? LPL constantly poaches talent from LCK.
hmdrflt,yarrowbloom,11/28/2021,1,667.0,The best option for you by far is Morgana! She was buffed so her black pool does increased damage to jungle camps but her most common role is support. Shes good with catch  adcs like jinx and into hook/engage support matchups.  Other options for you are amumu (more jungle than support good with an adc with strong all in like draven miss fortune or Lucian.) Or nautilus (his E is buffed to do increased damage to camps but his most popular role is definitely jungle.   Further off meta would be gragas jarvan (aery poke AS build) poppy (good into Leona Rakan pyke and Nautilus because she nullifies dashes ) trundle (good into tanks) and Zac (good into immobile teams with teammates who dive with him).   But I would definitely say Morgana is ur best option- the others suffer from not being the best support/only good in specific matchups or having a slow/unhealthy jungle clear. The most important thing is that youre playing a champ u enjoy!

hmdeuxo,MapPotential9009,11/28/2021,1,19.0,I think really poor matchmaking by Riot is having a huge impact on toxicity. There is a clear difference in skill/map awareness from enemies and teammates its like watching a pro player vs a first timer. The past 2 weeks have been so up and down theres no way the current system is working properly and its causing a lot of frustration and anger on both teams.

hmegqpz,bqx23,11/28/2021,1,284.0,Man even with gauntlets I still think its pretty Sett favored. Sett runs a fighting pit in Noxus and is only able to do that because he is stronger than everyone else. He takes on the strongest fighters in Runeterra letting them use their signature weapons and armor and beats them into a pulp everytime.

hme325l,EmilianoR24,11/28/2021,1,19.0,First timing a champion in Diamondd would also ruin the match for 9 people you can have have a smurf maybe a few divisions lower than your main and you wouldnt ruin the game for anyone its really just climbing up there thats the issue

hmeg0zg,AFLe5,11/28/2021,1,46.0,DK pretty much already locked up their roster 4 days ago so it doesn’t seem like they were interested on TheShy to begin with   We just waiting for the official announcement of their roster on 1 December   We might see a switch in DK roles SM or Canyon playing another role or having a CL top laner until Nuguri comes back next split

hmet7mn,Yashimasta,11/28/2021,1,9.0,Besides Lulu and Morg the other champs would be very tough to play in a solo lane. As I said this is more for fun than an actual idea I think should be added but even if it was it would be a rare sight to see a level 16 support.
hmelh68,Naerlyn,11/28/2021,1,63.0,Yup! We have a channel for him. Ive never looked at it though so I cant say anything more off the top of my head.
hmeqbud,Kaleph4,11/28/2021,1,741.0,hard to tell where to put Sylas exactly. he can either become a great antihero with an superb redemtion arc or he becomes a terrorist who just want´s to burn down the whole of demacia.  Lux on the other hand want just for everyone to live in peace and is also an ankerpoint for all the mages who also just want to be left alone. how she evolves depends on how Sylas evolves. if he get´s a redemtion Lux will play a mayor part to set the rails for him to become a better person. if he becomes a terrorist then she will become the main hero of Demacia as one of the few people who are able to fight him.  So if Sylas becomes the evil guy then Lux is hands down the main protagonist in the Video game. If he gets his redemtion Sylas Story is way more interesting to play as. Whatever happens their stories will always be connected to eachother.  When we look at it right now Lux is set up to be the face of freedom and as the main hero for Demacia and she is way to popular that this will change anytime soom. As a Lux main myself I realy don´t mind this ) but I hope that they will treat Sylas better than what they did with Viego

hme8ppz,00Dandy,11/28/2021,1,25.0,Its hard to prevent and also hard to define what counts as smurfing. Is a silver player in bronze a smurf? At what point is it smurfing? Is someone allowed to move to another server to play with friends even if they are lower elo?   It makes Riot money. People might play the game more and they often buy skins or other stuff on their smurf accounts.  And for pro players for example it cannot be avoided. When a Korean player goes to Worlds in Europe he obviously has to climb through the ranks to get to Challenger. This is usually pretty fast because they also get high MMR accounts but they still have to go through ranks where they stomp everyone.

Also I would just change the soul buff to be you get KogMaw Passive instead of Sion passive. Thats really it.  I really dont even notice the map change with Hextech dragon though those gates feel useless in 90% of use cases. But thats probably a good thing it would be weird if all the dragon transformations felt lackluster but one of them stood out too much. Lets be real most people dont even notice earth dragon transformation while playing right? A couple rocks here and there?

hmenfsw,The-Devilz-Advocate,11/28/2021,1,33.0,>Jhin seems to be in Piltover according to the Awaken cinematic.   Years after Arcane. Hell that awaken cinematic is technically a  flashback because he is currently in Ionia once again. The awaken cinematic is the battle that Akali and Kayn were investigating as one of the possible Jhin sightings when they were pursuing Jhin. We see this in Zeds comic chapter 4.
hmehna4,Throgg_not_stupid,11/28/2021,1,284.0,His description in Where Icathia once stood is.. almost human-like   >Saijax was the beating heart of the Kohari a shaven-headed giant with skin pockmarked by the ravages of a childhood illness and a forked beard stiffened to points with wax and white chalk  When I read it I thought that he changed after the fall of Icathia due to the magic of the lantern or the void or something but perhaps he was always like that
hmedlcy,metradomo,11/28/2021,1,12.0,People who seem to think range is so busted should try playing adc in 2021/22 when everyone has gap closers and more damage earlier than you spike. Not to mention the chaos that is SoloQ where nobody plays as a team and actually care to peel for the adc. Where your sup will steal your kills and farm and more often than not be an auto-filled XP sucker. Range was an advantage once. It no longer feels like that. New Lethal Tempo didnt fix adc its actually being more used and better used by melee.
hmdnvse,monosolo830,11/28/2021,1,29.0,Zoe Q range 800 Nidalee Q range 1500  Btw why you include another ability E into the comparison? We’re comparing Q  Then how about Nidalee can heal teammates has a jump has executes    We’re just saying that all skillshots shouldn’t be balanced because you can always dodge them. (Including Zoe bublble)
hmevhu9,RaiseYourDongersOP,11/28/2021,1,288.0,Yeah I mean DLs team was by far the weakest compared to the rest imo. It also doesnt help that his top laner has no champ pool yet.
hmer8lg,metradomo,11/28/2021,1,16.0,Youre right. My bad. I thought Sterak was still melee only but they changed it on 10.23 it seems. Which is funny cause I seem to recall not being able to buy it recently. Maybe I had shieldbow they cancel out one another.

hmenfre,__v1ce,11/28/2021,1,8.0,I assume you play Irelia? Which probably means you go like 20/5 every game so the game recognizes you as a smurf when Its just your champ
hmenvc3,Belaire,11/28/2021,1,739.0,Is Asol literally larger than galaxies in the lore?  If so he would be at least thirty six duodecilliom (13 zeroes) times larger than Runeterra assuming its similar to Earth in size.

hme3hwu,RedZoomTV,11/28/2021,1,2.0,This is especially needed as I almost just lost a game due to this -        I was dead I had 2 teammates alive while the enemy team only had 1 zed. My jax was going to the nexus which was completely open while MF for whatever reason pinged the hextech dragon for jax to help her.        What ended up happening is Jax almost killed zed but zed lived and MF solod dragon instead of following jax. The whole time MF was Pinging dragon I was trying to spam ping the nexus and MF to end the game as the enemy team only had 1 person alive and it wouldve been free.        I only use pings to communicate as in all my years of playing league since season 2 Ive been talking in chat non stop mostly useless things and gotten many of my accounts perma banned because of it. Therefore I decided to disable my chat completely not even being able to open it so that I would prevent further bans and actually focus on the game. That worked as I got my first honor check point in pretty much ever and Ive gotten a higher rank

hmewf68,drakoran,11/28/2021,1,4.0,People are less likely to FF now due to objective bounties and rightfully so.   Honestly you’ll find a lot more enjoyment in the game if you just ignore FF entirely.  Just use losing games as a chance to practice last hitting limit testing playing from behind split pushing trying out new items/builds etc.   Not FF’ing is not toxic behavior. There’s no rule that says your team has to surrender when you fall behind.  Being someone who spams FF and surrender votes bitches to their team if they won’t FF AFK’s when the team won’t FF etc. is toxic behavior. If you’re one of these then maybe you’re the source of the toxicity not the victim? I used to be one of those players too then I got over it and enjoy the game more.

His lore literally is him saving Runeterra from extinction it makes every champions lore insignificant. It is the most reworked champion which means Ryze is too important to just be a dead champion and would rather get reworked multiple times instead of shelved. Also outside in Esports players like Faker played Ryze a lot which gives Ryze an image and Faker is always represented as Ryze. If Esports was a fictional world Faker would be the protagonist!

I feel like green would be the second most common because it seems like the most generic honor you could give a teammate then Im pretty sure yellow and blue are the rarest do you think blue actually takes the cake?

hmeeaof,nllckk,11/28/2021,1,14.0,the OCE super-server is famously the hardest region to compete in absolute genetic freaks forces of nature and genius masterminds compete on the rift for a chance at glory in the hyper-competitive LCO environment. EDG boot-camped on the OCE super-server before worlds however only made it to gold 3 due to the pure skill gap that the region has in comparison to minor region China. They didnt publicly release this of course they were embarrassed however the mentor-ship and mental fortitude generated in the OCE trenches commanded them into their world finals victory. OCE teams continuously fail at worlds not due to a lack of skillful players but that our worlds teams are drawn from the 80 million dollar powerball lotto.

hmdxwrj,wobmaster,11/28/2021,1,282.0,this will only get worse because of franchising and the league structure. The ERLs actually seem to do well enough to support more people now making a living but with franchising you naturally limit the amount of players that can participate per season.

hmdmol7,apclps,11/28/2021,1,111.0,No you misunderstood what was happening.      The smaller guy outgrappled the bigger opponents **because he was a better grappler** not because he was smaller. If you follow modern MMA you would be insane to believe a 170lb grappler has a chance against a grappler of equal skill weighing 240lb+.      The whole point of those early fights was to show the power of Gracie Jiu Jitsu not the power of being small.      PS -- This is also why the Gracies got the shit beat out of them by the Gracie Hunter Sakuraba.    He was a better grappler.

I dont think he did anything impressive at any point the rest of the year though and he still has been retired for the past year so that point still stands. Also idk what you mean about calling Sven trash being revisionist he totally was. Worst player on EG by far throughout the year. Sven had a ton to work with having three legitimately good laners and he did very little with it. His 2020 wasnt impressive either. This isnt 2018 Sven anymore its 2021 Sven. As for Solo yeah hes a fine top for LCS standards but hes not that impressive and towards the low end for LCS top laners. High end academy tops are just as good or better with more potential for growth.

hmdwh2x,Ruuuuuude,11/28/2021,1,8.0,Ok so dont play a multiplayer PvP game if you dont like getting beaten and that isnt fun for you?  You will always get games where you get stomped. Even if you play ranked against people your own skill level it will happen. You will even have games who are lower ranks who will manage to stomp occasionally. You might get stomped by a lower ranked player whilst making no mistakes simply because your team does bad. These are just things that happen in a multiplayer teambased PvP game.  If that isnt fun for you maybe dont play multiplayer teambased games as its literally impossible to always ensure a balanced close game every game.

hmdz4mt,AureaMediocritas1,11/28/2021,1,41.0,Illaoi isnt a tank....   Tanks are either tanky and have a lot of cc or some cc and peeling.   Then there are Juggernauts tanky fighters that are as tanky as tanks but are usually immobile (when we dont count singed and udyr) and have the highest dmg potential in the game.   And you got wrong why assassins bought goredrinker in the first place it wasnt about the sustain but the dmg. It had a stronger last stand.    Another thing that you forget is the risk /reward of melee Champions. Because marksmen are ranged champions theyre so squishy that theyre not suited to 1v1. A melee champion is suited to do that because he always must be in a danger zone to be able to do anything (except illaoi since she is a melee - mage hybrid. But because of that she is the champion that is easier to kite)

hmdwgr2,-Acerin,11/28/2021,1,227.0,LPL fandom is among the most fickle ones I’ve seen  You mean every league fans? lmao  The same people that calls an owner abusive for screaming at their team for playing bad right?   Then the same fanbase trys to compare league to a real sport. What a joke. lmao

hmefh8s,Helixranger,11/28/2021,1,4.0,[This website](https://www.alphr.com/how-to-change-language-league-of-legends/) seems to have instructions. You need to scroll to How to Change Language in League of Legends on PC  The KR server however doesnt like tempering with game files (its the only server iirc that will ban for modding) but I doubt language changes are a big enough deal. Somebody who is on that server will be a better person to talk to than me however.  Also the client might reset it after a patch update so watch out for that.

hmdwnox,criptus205,11/28/2021,1,1205.0,Kayys basically confirmed on Discord that TSMs roster has been locked. A couple of other things he said- the roster is a not full development roster it is not a budget roster and he expects it to place top 3. He seemed to stress the fact that Chawy speaks Mandarin which suggests that the unknown players are probably LPL imports though thats hardly a surprise at this point.

hmdlzhl,Exmerus,11/28/2021,1,236.0,Youre right in a way. But there arent much better rookie junglers around and Jose is cheap. Probably almost as cheap as a rookie lol plus he brings brand power in Latin America. FLY had a super roster last year and it disbanded because they couldnt pay them so they cant get a better top to cover that weakness. They will rather keep Jose and send a rookie top is the cheapest and more balanced way.
hmdobg4,Jf3qnho,11/28/2021,1,485.0,Conq was too broken and for the ones of Yasuo and Yone their Q wouldnt lower their CD with the AS that provided old LT for some reason now it does Trynda abused the previous version and the new one as for Irelia she doesnt even need it she already gets an absurd amount of AS so conq is just better.

hmdqdee,VG_Crimson,11/28/2021,1,133.0,If were counting weapons Vi has her gauntlets which probably pack a heavy punch than Sett can dish out with his basic knuckle dusters.  Not to mention Vi has a canonical shield while Sett only has a shield in game to protect him. Also she has the mobility advantage which means the world in a close fight like this.  I think Vi wipes him. No chance.   She is going to hit harder have more durability and more mobility.

hmdre6x,weirdfishes505,11/28/2021,1,3.0,Can someone explain the point of ever going Kraken?  Like if youre worried about tanks just go Cut-Down and LDR. Shieldbow and Galeforce can actually help you dodge/tank abilities in a team fight which is so much more important for a DPS champ as the longer you live the more damage you do.

hme0n3b,deediazh,11/28/2021,1,231.0,Summit is better than Alphari Alphari is a great laner but if you cant have the game sense players like Bwipo and Summit have then you cant really transition those resources well. It was the main problem of TL at worlds funnel your top side solely to have a lane barely ahead in CS and a  bit of pressure that didnt amount to anything.

Sett is half Vastayan who have fought against ascended so his physical capabilities would probably mean he can tank the gaunlets and hes also so fast that she would struggle to land hits. Not to mention his better experience training and ofc Vastayan magic.

hmduvyg,floodyberry,11/28/2021,1,,to be fair that definitely sounds like typical doublelift
hmdo587,Destructodave82,11/28/2021,1,,Honestly there is just zero reasons to really have subs in Esports. Subs exist in Traditional sports for a variety of reasons and see play. Injuries more spots practice squads players getting tired players needing breaks etc.  You really dont get any of that in something like LoL. They play very few actual stage games dont have injuries nor any real fatigue. You just have no reason to use subs.  Its just something that sounds cool that really doesnt do much except potentially piss off your other players.

Yeah obviously in lane it’s a different story than 3 item adc vs supp. Yeah obviously you can outplay people whose entire kit is skillshots. If you can’t accept you misplayed in the situation you posted and want to blame balance then fine. You’re literally too stupid or ignorant to realize how wrong you are anyways. Don’t waste my time with this crap. You probably think LAS gold is high elo.

hmebnoa,The-War-Life,11/28/2021,1,47.0,That was their intention with map changes depending on soul in the first place. The goal was to make you have to adapt your playstyle depending on the map. Chemtech hextech and mountain drake maps do that very very well. Ocean and Infernal aren’t bad but could get some slight increases and cloud probably just needs more OOC movement speed in the zones to be better.

hmdtv5k,Scrinwarrior,11/28/2021,1,154.0,Sevika had Shimmer.  Sett has magic and the fact that his half-Vastayan background makes him stronger faster and more durable than normal humans.  I’m more than willing to believe those two things equal out.
hmdgyct,jayjaybird0,11/28/2021,1,14.0,My point is Fears and Charms are more powerful slows ***and*** take control away from the players afflicted by them. And taking control away immediately is more valuable than taking control away *eventually*.  Then theres also the fact that Fears and Charms would have a set duration while Sleep can be ended early or even right away by the target getting hit by most forms of Champion damage.  &#x200B  Basically Fears and Charms outperform Drowsy in every metric yet despite that Drowsy got its slow-percentage *reduced* (specifically Zoes Drowsy).

hmdtvm7,_gr1m,11/28/2021,1,18.0,Yes since I was banging my head on the keyboard looking for why I find myself doing less dmg than a minion and seemingly every time I need an ability it tends to be on cooldown... and I could not find any written reason as to why this is happening with Shaco because there is nothing written as to Riot nerfing his CD or base stats or damage... The runes I use are not really touched. So I guess this dip ( as I know for sure that mechanically I am actually better than I ever was) is a result of the accumulated changes to the game as a whole and the clown happens to be one of these champions that did not benefit out of.   Im just gonna stick to Shaco Support if I want to play him as this one is still broken and with the new caster items I think it will be a nightmare to play against but I will give him a break in the jungle. ...for now

hmdunjp,Caius004,11/28/2021,1,1.0,For learning itemization one thing that I did was to start an practice tool game and look at what every item that my champion could build and learn what they could do. It worked for me but its a long process. One other thing that you can do is watch champion guides. They have an itemization part where they explain when to build one item. If you still dont know what to build watch the suggested items from the shop since the start of season 11 they modified it making appear items that you could need against the enemy team and they are pretty accurate on that because they decide what you could build based on what high elo players build against certain champions.

hmdrsq1,WTF_Scuba,11/28/2021,1,260.0,Sure there is a debate to be had for a lot of the names. I can acknowledge that. I admit I didnt closely analyze/compare each players playing time so I could be wrong about including some people on the list.  I never said that these people have never played a professional game. I said that they are relatively inexperienced and have a ton of potential. A lot of these names fit.  Personally I didnt/dont put a lot of weight into Academy. There have been a lot of very talented players stuck in that system across every region. It isnt fair to dismiss a players potential who has very little LCS experience just because they have played a few splits in Academy. It is a very different experience.  A lot of the players you took issue with have played about three splits in the LCS. While that is a decent amount of time I still think it is fair to consider them relatively inexperienced. Especially when you compare them to someone like Svenskeren who this post is about. He has been playing professional League of Legends for over nine years. Thats about eighteen splits! That is a massive gap in experience compared to these players who have only played in three splits.

Also see if your friend will 1v1 you a bit in some customs so that you can get some practice vs a human.
hmdwg95,mivaad,11/28/2021,1,171.0,yeah but it was clear that neither was going straight for the kill that fight. The shimmer factory raid seems like a better place to look at their destructive power.

hme3www,DTRevengeance,11/28/2021,1,3.0,Rakan is built like a fucking twig. In an actual 1v1 setting like a boxing match he might be able to evade and dodge Sett about for a bit but itd only be a matter of time before he gets smacked.
hmdivfj,IlDaydreamIl,11/28/2021,1,36.0,So if every teamfight I get focused my team peels me and I die near the end of the teamfight but my team can wipe out the reminder of the enemies Im bad because I died a lot? I only care about winning the match and getting gold I couldnt care less about a shiny K/D/A. If I die but we win the teamfight because enemy team blew half their cds on me then so be it. We won the teamfight. I died 9 times in 30 mins? Yeah. We won a lot of teamfights up to that point? Yeah.  I try to position myself do dmg and kite as good as I can every teamfight. If I end up dying then so be it. I cant do more. But you cant expect people to dodge Zacs E every teamfight specially when it has a range that big and can come from outside vision. Yeah you can buy all the control wards you want and you can use all your trinkets. So can the enemy and they can remove your controls too. Lets not pretend the enemy team is stupid. If they have a Zac Fiddle or similar they WILL playa round vision and prioritize clearing all wards you might have before fighting. Just like they will prioritize Kindred marks for example.  Its less If Zac hits you you die so dont get hit and more You **will** eventually get hit by Zac.** which still shouldnt result in you losing more than your total health to 1 combo from him. Even with 1 ap item. But he has Demonic Embrace Yeah 1 dmg item. With 1 dmg item he gets to oneshot people now?  Imagine if an adc would buy a thornmail/spirit visage and then he gets to literally tank an entire team for 20 seconds while doing the same dmg as any other adc. He got 1 tank item so I find it pretty fair that he can become a tank just with that. Same as I find it pretty fair that a tank with a single dmg item can become an assassin. Right...? Not really imo.

If u run after an ilusion for example  youre probably already where the mage wants u.   >by now demacia has put enough time and effort into protection against mages that they would be equiped for dealing with mages in their own land  its a lot easier to build a wall with petricide in it....or even an statue then equip an army. as for mage hunters  obviously no mage would live anywhere near the damn thing  meaning that hunters arent running around after mages in the middle of the demacian streets or whatever.

Not to mention Vi has a canonical shield while Sett only has a shield in game to protect him. Also she has the mobility advantage which means the world in a close fight like this.  I think Vi wipes him. No chance.  Harder hits more mobility better durability. Sett wins only in bare handed.

hme83cr,Destructodave82,11/28/2021,1,333.0,Your really trying to over embellish a very minor issue in comparison to real sports subs.  Point is subs have infinitely less value in Esports than they do traditional. You might use one once in a blue moon for a sickness. MAYBE.  Having to use an academy player 1 game in a season if that pretty much shows that subs for the most part is just a buzz word that doesnt work all that well in Esports.  Its simply not hte same thing as traditional sports where they make way more sense. Its just how it is. I mean you know this. People arent subbed out mid-LCS game because of injuries exhaustion etc. Your not getting concussions in an LCS game your not running yourself to the max either.  IM not trying to knock Esports I mean Im on LoL sub-reddit. But hte point is the value of a sub in a system like LCS is honestly quite low and more often than not detrimental to the team to even use. In say the NFL if a player just ran a 90 yard run hes not gonna be playing the next couple series. If a Basketball player has played 30 minutes hes going to sit on the bench to catch his breath etc. IF a player gets hit hard on a play he might sit out a play or 2 the list goes on. You need subs for minute to minute plays in a traditional sports game. Thats just not the case in Esports they dont even have their coaches during the game much less doing subs.

hmds9h5,yarrowbloom,11/28/2021,1,667.0,Karma is a good champ that fits into ur description. She can be played mid or top but top karma sometimes picks grasp/tankier items. She can build Ludens or choose to go moonstone/imperial/shureylas all pretty good items on her.  Senna also fits the bill. She can be adc or support and has pretty flexible runes with lethality adc items or tank items.  Maokai and galio are honorable mentions. Maokai can be built AP with imperial mandate or liandrys for damage on his E. If hes played topside he builds more tanky. Galio can be support and is similar in that he can build tanky or be an ap source (protobelt).

hmdmk2w,Mundane_Spend_7629,11/28/2021,1,2.0,You cant make an AI to do such thing. The AI needs to encounter the same scenario over and over but how often can it encounter it in this game? No matter how hard you try you will gonna end up with someone who win a lot of LP in the winning team and someone who wins almost no LP same happening in the other team too.   A simple AI needs around 40-50 generations to play the T-Rex Game from Google Chrome so imagine how many generations he will gonna need for a game like League of Legends.

hmdcojv,nightnightgame,11/28/2021,1,4.0,Those hundreds of games are exactly what I mean. Imagine I won 60 games and lost 40 games. Thats 60% winrate right? But how many of these 60 games were won because of luck? At least it felt good to win. Now how many games were lost while performing above your own average? When yesterday you played while being sleepy and tired and won three games in a row. Today you are alert you have free time you are ready to go... and then the enemy Camille is 6-0 by minute 4. And then your jungler last picks Yuumi. And then your client randomly freezes. You play better today than you played yesterday no doubt about it but it doesnt matter.  Yet if your challenger friend played instead of you today it would have mattered. So where is the cutoff when the game feels like its mostly your gameplay that decides whether you win or lose? Of course its subjective Im just curious about some fresh answers because I feel like it might be challenger playing in gold and I dont like that answer.

hmdgizs,DemonicGeekdom,11/28/2021,1,667.0,Sona Zyra Nami  I’m mentally prepared for the “the support who got carried” comments which would be funny because I hate Zyra support and play her mid.
hmeem8f,xxWelchxx,11/28/2021,1,5.0,True just after doing well it usually means you won. So enemy teams can often be salty and not honour etc that was more my thoughts. But i see your point.
hmdkusw,baked_tea,11/28/2021,1,142.0,Also the opposite
hmdy2gl,Oraphy,11/28/2021,1,305.0,Meaning you have to play around a different area of the map in my opinion that is a strategic decision. At the same time if you can take control its a strong point you can play of.

hmdfanx,xpxpx,11/28/2021,1,197.0,Its really a brilliant play from EG. If Jojopyun doesnt work out and they end up deciding he needs a little more time in Academy before he starts they can basically pick up Jensen for a steal between splits because by that point I expect TL would be pretty desperate to drop him and would void his buyout.

hme0fhm,Eldard_Lefteros,11/28/2021,1,20.0,If you die 2v2 it is your fault. Junglechamps have specific routes and some junglers are farm heavy and others are gank heavy. When i jungle i often try to help but sometimes my botlane is perma dead and ganking them results only into them burning their sums and no kill for us in the worst case we lose even 2v3 .  What you can do is keep an eye on your jungler if he is topside dont play too agressive and respect the enemy jungler if you dont know where he is

hmdgnnm,MegaEmpoleonWhen,11/28/2021,1,99.0,No gauntlets Sett most likely. Hes like 7Ft tall and built like a brick shithouse + vastayan magic.  &#x200B  With gauntlets Vi could probably win tbh Sett mostly just stat checks his opponents who cant hit anywhere near as hard as he can. Sett really isnt that well trained one of his voice lines is literally I dont bother with jabs if youre throwing throw it hard. that mindset would get him killed if he ever fought anyone in his weight league which a gauntleted up Vi would definitely be in.

hmentue,I_hate_Teemo,11/28/2021,1,5.0,There is no motion blur in the game.  Maybe you are bothered by your screens motion blur that comes from a slow pixel reponse time and since moving the camera makes a lot of pixels have to change you can get this effect. Try to see if your screen has an overdrive setting (but dont put to max value as it can cause minor color distortion).  Or maybe you are bothered by screen tear which can be removed by enabling Vsync at the cost of small input lag (or G-sync/Freesync if yoiur monitor supports it).

No matter how good a boxer is - they are highly unlikely to win against someone 2 or more divisions above them.  Sett is probably around double her weight.
hmdp7y5,funslammer,11/28/2021,1,7.0,Imo a part of the toxicity comes from the fact that it’s a team game and your own impact on the outcome of the game can be minimal sometimes and people get frustrated.
hme5c8x,terenul1,11/28/2021,1,72.0,Sure damage is supposed to be higher but not at this level. Playing tank is griefing unless picked last in specific team comps. Making an entire class of champions almost nonexistent shouldnt be what riot is trying to do.

The sould was always supposed to be something thats good but not a total game changer. Youre not gonna win a 10 to 40 game because you got one of the old souls. But now youre gonna win those games.

What youve listed there dont seem like strong enough connections imo to say its Jhin. I think the giant horn attachment is simply a way to have a violin that looks a little steampunk (like the entirety of Piltover is) and to amplify the sound. Nothing more.  We know what Jhin looks like under his mask and he looks pretty similar but again im far from convinced. Also who says thew theater is exactly the same. Again its a lot of speculation.

hmduu9z,Scrinwarrior,11/28/2021,1,,Maybe he is a magical being in a world of magic beings. Maybe his magic isn’t special when compared to Ahri Xayah or Neeko.  But you know who it IS special when compared to? Vi.  I get it she has special weapon and that weapon is powerful. I agree. But when Sett is faster stronger more durable and has been fighting trained professionals his entire life (which is longer than Vi’s I might add) all the cards point to Sett being the victor.   And even if I roll with your “he can’t hit as hard as Vi with the guantlets” assumption… he doesn’t have to. He has faster reaction times more experience and better training than Vi. Raw strength does not win fights by default.

I actually did more damage to champions and turrets than a guy in my recent match who claimed that he had a bad game (and I had 20 kills). We both played adc we both had similar stats. Literally only difference was that I once said word loser to a guy inted by watching me dying right next to him and he just walked away and later called me shithead. Then I snapped and gave up.

hmdk4w3,jayjaybird0,11/28/2021,1,14.0,Not inherently. In the case of Zoes Sleep its bonus damage is dependent on the damage dealt by whatever woke up the target. If it was woken up by something small like a weak basic attack the bonus damage will be small too. Lillias Sleep however does an amount of bonus damage to the target regardless of what woke them up.  &#x200B  But dont act like targets afflicted with Fear or Charm wont also be taking a whole bunch of damage too.  Ahris Charm causes the afflicted target to take increased damage from all of her abilities (not just one instance of damage) and Evelynns Charm reduces the targets magic resistance meaning theyll take increased damage from ***all*** sources of magic damage.

You can see this both in Arcane and in game. Sett is more immobile than she is. She doesnt have just raw strength its the whole package.  Saying Sett is magical just doesnt mean much except that hes tougher than the average cookie.

Your points were completely garbage and straight up false.  > I said it’s hypocritical to say they won’t do holidays then only do Lunar New Year.  Riot literally never said they dont do holidays. They said no one buys the snowdown skins and majority of their playerbase dont care for Christmas. Why would Riot put that much effort into something less than 10% of their entire playerbase give a shit about?  >they still make the Lunar New Year events which are even more limited in terms of numbers of cultures celebrating them than Christmas  China #1 largest region Korea #3 largest region Vietnam #4 largest region and NA #5 largest region all celebrate or have a sizeable playerbase that celebrates Lunar New Years.  How the fuck would Lunar New Years be more limited when their 1st 3rd and 4th largest regions all celebrate the event and even their 5th largest region has players who celebrate it?  Do you realize how little players are in EU + all the wildcards together compared to China Korea and Vietnam?  >CCP shills and bots downvote me all you want. Truth and free speech arent exactly your strong points.  Youre so cringe buddy.  I like how you talk about free speech when you label anyone who disagrees with you as shills and bots. Youre even using a 6 month old account with negative comment karma. Do you realize how ironic it is that an account like yours is trying to call others bots? How much self-awareness do you lack?   I also like you just disregard Korean Taiwanese and Vietnamese players who also celebrate Lunar New Year like the ignorant racist asshole you are.

hmdql29,szczur_mysz,11/28/2021,1,293.0,Its not that strong anymore agree but: 1. Its still decent damage got reduced but its still solid option. 2. Not only Goredrinker helps this playstyle but all the healing and shielding this class has. Sterak at most. I cant think of an item that promotes high% health. Whole concept of healing requires you to take damage then you can heal some of it.

hme0f4l,Pur1tas,11/28/2021,1,6.0,Because „Meele only“ and „ranged only“ as item limitations is imo a bandaid not more.  And riot seems to agree as we only have one single item left with this kind of limitation.

hmdzl78,npri0r,11/28/2021,1,,Kindred is a spirit god and the god of death to particular mortals of runeterra. We don’t even know how death works with celestials beyond what happened to pantheon. And even then he died because he pretty much made himself mortal.  Death can affect Aurelion sol but not the kindred representation of death.   Also in LoR Aurelion Sol has a few celestials he created like the scourge. Even if at first Targon forced him to combat the void it’s now his main enemy.

hmeedcg,BathroomSeparate9233,11/28/2021,1,5.0,Im not sure about that if red was the only honor you could give opponents it would be far more widespread than the others because that was the only option you had for them as opposed to teammates where you had to pick between multiple.      That makes sense right?

hme0sdf,Seneido,11/28/2021,1,299.0,people overvalue the left out players a lot. all of them proved that they arent good enough to cut it out for worlds. do you wanna spend a million to not make it out of groups for past 3years jensen? i guess last year was the first time he looked good because most of his team looked even worse.  on the other hand you have mikyx who is world class but had the worst year in his career. he had an entire year to get out of it and pretty much stayed consitantly bad same for wunder who lucked out that fnc couldnt acquire a toplaner from anywhere.

hmdsxet,hashtag_team_warpig,11/28/2021,1,46.0,I can respect your opinion and where your coming from not being a long time fan of the universe. However I would be extremely disappointed if Vi/Jinx Piltover/Zaun remained the focus of the entire series.
hme4e75,FearlessLeg5170,11/28/2021,1,,I mean yeah the guy has played 40 champs in competetive lmao. Imo the real problem is his personality though and the playstyle wasnt fitting it was like 2 teams in 1 - rekkles and nemi / selfmade bwipo and hyli. but it annoys me when people on reddit claim that nemesis is a bad player clearly he is not he has accomplished in those 2 years more than most of the lec. and people praise nisqy even though with him they got 5th in summer when in reality lec level seemed to go down + fnc had a more synergized botlane.
hmedxnr,maxGplayz,11/28/2021,1,2.0,Why would you want to play on a Garena server. From what I have heard. Garena is the worst server to play on
hmeiq00,Random_Stealth_Ward,11/28/2021,1,6.0,> just hug your closest friend and he is a lot less scary! Happy hugging!  This is also a good way to know if the friend you are with is actually not a friend. Happened to me before I had a good time chilling with the raptors in jungle every time I played a match and never EVER killed them. This all changed until K6 jumped at me and the circle never disappeared.   K6 hurt me a lot physically but the true damage for me was that the raptors who I considered my friends who I trusted and invited to McDonalds never considered me a friend nor an ally.  That was the first time I had so many people around me yet felt completely isolated. Or maybe it was the brain damage from having k6 pounce me

Second even if not it still doesnt address my point. They have an entire team with plenty of money. Hire more people if needed to make these extras (as I said these extra things DO bring in cash flow) or maybe a bit of overtime over a longer duration. I never said they should accept a low quality job so I dont know why youd even bring it up.

hmdkhhg,bischof11,11/28/2021,1,,Y when they added iron elo they changed it that you start around iron 4 after 1 game and your next games gave you insane amount of lp.  Since 1-2 seasons they added that playing normal games before playing first time ranked will affect your starting ranked mmr. You probabaly played better than the other beginners resulting in higher normal mmr and higher starting ranked mmr.  Did you play normals with higher rank friends before going first time ranked?  Congratulazion for your progress.

hme722b,pourovertime,11/28/2021,1,23.0,I doubt you were truly playing against a Smurf especially in normals. Probably just a good had a good game or a good player. I think its good to play against players better than you. Watch how they abuse the mistakes you and your team mates make and learn from it.

hmeg03u,Bruhmamagaming,11/28/2021,1,12.0,Ive always used Triforce on yorick its so much better for splitpushing espescially now that triforce stacks on towers unless enemy is tanky then go DS.  Im also really confused why so many Yoricks go DS now before it was literally triforce or die for most yorick players.

hmehy1q,gahlo,11/28/2021,1,5.0,Which is why I stopped following lore in the first place. Some sections would get multiple rewrites while other stuff got left in 2013 era.
hmdukta,Glem_,11/28/2021,1,5.0,Dont get out of your comfort zone keep playing support for a while.  Spam champions like Zyra Xerath Brand Lux Swain Vex etc... Until you feel confident playing damage dealers.  Then Id recommend you to swap midlane and learn the basics such as matchups trading wave control farming rotations...  Unless you consider yourself a skilled player I dont recommend you swapping from supp to top/jung. The transition from support to Mid or even ADC are way easier because these roles have more similarities than jng/top.  Also the most important thing take your time and dont burnout. Changing roles could be very frustrating so watch didactical streamers YouTube content use tools like Blitz porofessor and lolalytics. Just be patient because it will take time.
hmdhzas,TTVBasedJafar,11/28/2021,1,16.0,Riot after the tribunal disbanded cant punish people for shit lmao
hmdq1vb,szczur_mysz,11/28/2021,1,289.0,After Goredrinker on assasins its the last thing meta want to see. Really. Also Sunderer requires synergy which a lot of tanks dont have. But I can see your point about mythic item not being the greatest 1st item option and I build Frozen Heart as first item  really often.
hmdiyx1,elirisi,11/28/2021,1,217.0,Yeah see the problem is what game is RL? Real Life? oh its rocket league? Is this game still alive?
hmdrqj1,Vectivus_61,11/28/2021,1,118.0,So Singed is going to team up with Velkoz?
hmdwcsh,King0llie,11/28/2021,1,302.0,the worst thing about being a jungle main is when your bot and mid have 0 lane prio and you are expected to solo drakes.  You get screeched at by lanes and when you ask for assistance they cant come because they are stuck at tower
hmdzkxh,MagicianXy,11/28/2021,1,,Yes it works the same as camo does for every champion that has camo. Only thing Im not totally sure of is the interaction near the border of the zone.   My last comment was mostly just making a general observation about using sweeper vs Evelynn. Was a bit of a tangent.
hme84va,Fudouri,11/28/2021,1,333.0,This is why I am against franchising still and all for promotion and relegation.
hme4xez,Mundane_Spend_7629,11/28/2021,1,2.0,It may be a problem with the setting you have on your video card software. Try to lower the graphics of the game or change the setting of the Tessellation in the software to something that your video card can handle.
hme8e4d,757packerfan,11/28/2021,1,11.0,Because its fun.  Let me poke the crap out of the enemy team with Miss Fortunes E with Liandrys before you engage and we should be good.

hmdh2o5,Lord_Dust_Bunny,11/28/2021,1,610.0,I dont think that is possible. Brand **as Brand** at minimum is multiple centuries old by the time Arcane takes place. Ryze is likewise that old. By the time Arcane takes place Ryze is already blue (and has been for longer than Piltover existed) and Brand is an insane pyromancer (and has been longer than Piltover existed).

hmdsrak,valorantboy,11/28/2021,1,5.0,I think you just need to get used to using right click to move as I dont see any better alternate keybind for it. You can use attack move (Its the A key) then use left click to move afterwards and it will automatically target the nearest thing to you. However just keep on playing. Generally what you need to use alternative keybinds on are player spectates which are F1-F5 keys and pings.

Quit crying do your best no matter what.

If the mmr is high it will be so hard to take it higher and any loose will decrease it so I would not try to boost it in preseason. But if the mmr is low as I said before well you got nothing to lose so go ahead.

Im not *that* good but you are playing half a champion if you are only doing QRQ.

hme3zq0,CHISENone,11/28/2021,1,6.0,learning itemization does take a long time i would say for tristana your build is pretty straight forward you can go kraken slayer > phantom dancer > infinity edge > lord dominiks regards > guardian angel almost every game and be totally fine especially if youre lower ranked or just playing normals. poppy is definitely a bit harder because tanks obviously have to build pure defense which is  based mostly on what the enemy team is and its hard to know which item you want to go because theres so many options to choose from and you dont know which suits the specific game and comp youre playing with/against the best until youve played the game enough and know the items strengths and weaknesses better. i would say generally that force of nature is your best bet as an item against sizeable magic damage threat and dead mans plate is generally good for physical damage threat as poppy so you can start there and work your way up

If she uses ult but forfeits her ability to threaten the enemy off the Baron shes mostly just wasting her ult. This is something Ive noticed of pro players that Ive specifically payed attention to for a long time ult isnt used to check Baron.

hme4ko9,iMidg3t,11/28/2021,1,66.0,No1s opinion on the game is objective thats why its called an opinion.  Besides we are arguing about riot not wanting to bring back a map skin not the state of the game.  And when you add in that riot said they dont want to spend resources on the winter map because of the drakes (while some randoms on the internet can make it happen along with other custom skins all for free) it does seem like they want to just save as much money as possible. And thats just one example.  New champs and the skins are all human eye-candies cuz they sell far better than monster champs and their skins.  Cutting out stuff out of the game so they dont need to spend resources/money on improving them (TT Dominion clubs various gamemodes etc.)  Yes riot is a company that aims for profit but there is a fine line between making money and player satisfaction and it seems like they stepped faaar into the money part while having player satisfaction in the furthest corner of the secondary priority.  For example teasing new champions. Have you played back when Jhin was teased or reworked gp? have you seen how riot executed the building of the hype? And then you have rell that...just popped in game....if I wasnt a support main i would not even notice she got into the game.   Jhin gp rework and winter map were times when riot tryharded with making the players excited about the game and nowadays theyre just cutting corners so they dont need to spend money on them despite hurting the player satisfaction.

Hes still definitely much better than any of the current LCK tops that arent Kiin. I thought he genuinely looked better than Nuguri in spring aside from playoffs too. Also keep in mind that he doesnt int any more now than he did in his prime the difference is that his botlane has been mostly useless for 2 years so when he draws 2-3 people toplane and dies his team isnt getting advantages elsewhere. That wouldnt be a problem on a team like DK or T1.

hme1hzz,Voeglein,11/28/2021,1,19.0,For normal games there isnt really a solution to this but thats fine as it is supposed to be a more relaxed game mode. And with a high skill disparity the low elo person will likely also face an unfavourable matchup.  For ranked games however there is no reason to be able to play together with friends in that manner. Ranked is to test your skills against others and queueing up at a high skill disparity just removes that concept altogether. Ranked flex is a shitshow for this exact reason.  And challenges like those that purposefully ruin the experience of other people by circumventing matchmaking procedures are not needed.
