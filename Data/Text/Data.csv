hm6xs7r,firehydrant_man,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,I dont  trust you but you should trust me   _proceeds to not trust him because trust is a 2 way street_   see I was right not to trust you
hm8kj6y,doglop,11/26/2021,1,26.0,Little bot you said I shouldnt care cause I would never be in high elo so you know its axtually my plan
hm72lv0,Obrejiklea,11/26/2021,1,13.0,yea a sweeper definitely screws you over especially since you can only place one ward per game
hm7g0fv,xiyeonah,11/26/2021,1,196.0,Why are you talking about Ibai? How is he comparable to retired pros from League? Hes in a completely different sphere in streaming. I am talking about NA personalities like IWD QTpie Doublelift Sneaky etc where they have another career after their professional careers. Some of these content creators are making more money than the top LEC players so of course its enticing.   You have to propose an argument that playing professionally in NA would be worth it but in honesty even if NA wins some of these streamers are making more. You have pros like Bunnyfufu who has a Youtube channel with 1.7m subs and probably made more money off his channel than he would have as a pro.   American viewers are worth more than European viewers because they speak one language. EU might have more people than NA but the viewing demographic is split because of the different languages. Its much easier to grow an audience in NA than EU for these reasons.
hm7oazg,Butthunter_Sua,11/26/2021,1,15.0,Dont play Skarner for one. Otherwise I match up fine against him as Sejuani because I dont fight alone. I play to my strengths utilize my CC and make for better team fights. Seems to me Skarner only really has a better ult than Udyr. Everything else Udyr does better.
hm8oxen,ComprehensiveBuy2759,11/26/2021,1,9.0,Corona virus
hm7fdch,GiannisisMVP,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,They are being replaced because they arent that good take your nationalist bullshit elsewhere.

hm8fk91,xNagsx,11/26/2021,1,100.0,I thought Karsa was rumored to leave?
hm6ypf2,No_Management_1177,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Yes you are
hm71rct,swellbaby,11/26/2021,1,83.0,What? You didnt enjoy that heartrending farewell video dedicated to him?
hm7cqge,Btigeriz,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,Where are the good french fans on twitter calling out the toxic french fans then? Until that happens the loud part of the fan-base will dictate the way people feel about the whole fanbase.

hm7bk4y,DT-Z0mby,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,man peoples hate boners for carlos really is something else. basically ur saying he would fuck over his own org just to fuck over another org. are you mentally stable?
hm83cxy,ChadAdonis,11/26/2021,1,149.0,>However their total debt grew over 100% in 1 year and taking in their total earnings theyre not profitable even with the revenue growth.   No theyre profitable. Balance sheet =/= Income statement  >They have a total market cap of 26.4 Billion USD right now and if you add in all their assets a company like Alphabet Apple Microsoft could buy them in cash if the government allowed it.  That an utterly irrelevant point.
hm7toqa,azersub,11/26/2021,1,252.0,Problem is most of the EUNE players are toxic but not in english
hm80jzc,doglop,11/26/2021,1,7.0,Imo is as easy as does the enemy has summoners? Then kill them withoit hesitating doesnt matter if the supp get the kill. They dont? Then try to leave the kill to the adc
hm8p343,EvilMangoOfDeath,11/26/2021,1,12357.0,THIS! The worst possible thing for killing dramatic tension is knowing that no one we care about will die. Riot as much as it will hurt y’all gotta have the balls to do what’s good for storytelling not just play in the sandbox with our favorite characters with zero stakes.
hm74b99,whydoyoureadnames,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,No he doesn’t. No one has a right to know anything about anyone else’s life on that level you thinking it doesn’t matter. I’m not sharing if my wife got cancer with my coworkers if that ever happened I’m any capacity.   A bunch of children on this sub that don’t understand privacy in any capacity and Adam is just as much of a child.
hm7qmjd,tddahl,11/26/2021,1,203.0,Since this starts 2am my time I hope there will be vods tomorrow!
hm765zd,Karpeeezy,11/26/2021,1,22.0,mmmm enjoy that sweet sweet USD and LA weather boys.
hm8e9rf,Burglarproof_Bread,11/26/2021,1,,Hmm that’s really unfortunate idk about the tutorials they have nowadays but the client has always been buggy.   Hope that works out for you though I would say to just play bots as a beginner (if you can I’m pretty sure that’s unlocked) Playing with random free champions in games is good to get experience!
hm8ass8,Toplaners,11/26/2021,1,108.0,>>I would call adcs the worst overall players at the same elo they look the worse off role whereas you can trust non 1 trick support players to competently play midlane most of the time.  You can trust any non support player to play support competently but I would never want a support player in any solo lane.  Sup players in solo lanes are free food unless they play something like karma or seraphine.
hm7tmu4,J539,11/26/2021,1,252.0,Oh didn’t know :( Isn’t it possible to just set up some infrastructure there or is it that costly ?
hm7hzk4,ApplePitou,11/26/2021,1,1.0,Good to know :3
hm8p69y,HJ994,11/26/2021,1,134.0,Congratulations!!!! Sorry your friends didn’t give you the props you deserve!!
hm70gpw,Espada42,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Its a Better community than yours thats for sure  there were a total of 10k comments on reddit all alone yet you blame french fans opportunistic and pathetic confirmation biais youre simply using this comment to let your anger out
hm71ztj,KasumiGotoTriss,11/26/2021,1,51.0,I like Talon but I cant sympathise with this cause hes so overtuned currently that even bugs arent stopping him.
hm88dqx,RedditChad420,11/26/2021,1,1.0,no + no one asked + ratio + didnt read
hm6y9ki,Sketches_Stuff_Maybe,11/26/2021,1,518.0,You fool! That was the clone!
hm8blhw,Soraman36,11/26/2021,1,12341.0,I like how the show keeps everything consistent with Jinx like when other characters are just about to make things better. She makes everything worst.
hm7knml,De-Lit,11/26/2021,1,13.0,Because most people are brain dead. There are times to take and times to leave it for wave management and 99% of people think its always the wrong time
hm87ymc,Nocturnezbreako,11/26/2021,1,5.0,Juggernauts are troll picks anyway grievous is the least of their issues
hm7dwar,jorissvd,11/26/2021,1,464.0,So you dont know wtf you are talking about. Okay. Thanks for your input.
hm6y27z,RookCauldron,11/26/2021,1,22.0,Ok and? Hans and Inspired had buyouts Perkz and Alphari had buyouts.
hm7m0vz,Mikael7529,11/26/2021,1,205.0,Yeah. Valorant somehow manages to have one Europe server and this game is even more dependent on low ping than League.
hm7o7w6,JamisonDouglas,11/26/2021,1,,I agree that they should but if they havent done it by now I highly doubt theyre going to.
hm7ds7o,meDeadly1990,11/26/2021,1,166.0,Yeah no. The only people who want a single EU server are the ones who havent been there when it was.
hm7459l,Dedziodk,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,It was so bad and traumatizing he played duos with his wife during fnc groupstage game xd
hm6z4od,Omnilatent,11/26/2021,1,518.0,Probably also the reason it never made live
hm7uhat,Ok-Travel-7875,11/26/2021,1,2.0,Its been this way for years.  Much better to make a new acc the moment you feel even remotely stuck and just get the good MMR and gains again rather than trying to fix what you currently have.   Riots system is quite shit.
hm7aapq,blissfullybleak,11/26/2021,1,29.0,I believe Alphari only signed for a year on TL.
hm7gy9l,ObseverOfSin,11/26/2021,1,23.0,I just watched the first episode and was bored out of my mind I am assuming its for kids but I thought id give it a go.   But yeah unoriginal predictable crap.

hm7wydz,Sirouz,11/26/2021,1,277.0,I’ve been hoping/praying for a re-merge for so many years :/ I got friends on both would be lovely to be able to play with them all on my main account.
hm7ly59,Fuhreeldoe,11/26/2021,1,47.0,Yeah thats exactly what I told you I was going to do. Because your personage is of someone who cant be argued with in any beneficial way. And again I dont know how many times I have to point out what you already said but if you want to blast me for being judgemental you should understand that conjecture about how someone feels why they feel that way and tell them the type of person they are all qualifies as judgement. I know what you came to do but Ive no intention of engaging with an attitude like that of the one youve presented here. Would venture a guess to say that you were already aware of that.
hm8t6uu,itsnotgingeritsbrown,11/26/2021,1,272.0,This didnt age all that well huh
hm766ai,happygreenturtle,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Exactly. The problem I have with all of this is not that Upset didnt tell them what happened but that he apparently made no effort to help them understand on an emotional level where he was coming from. Its really cold to leave within a day of the most important tournament of the year and then not even speak to your team to repair the damage when you come back.  The way Adam writes this is as though Upset said Sorry I have to be with my girlfriend left and then upon coming back made no effort to reconcile with the teammates he abandoned (even if for good reason) and actually attempted to replace them behind their backs as soon as whatever drama was happening in his personal life was dealt with. That is.. kind of messed up and honestly fuck players like that. They always cause more trouble than theyre worth
hm72r4o,therealbarbagianni,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,League careers are short to play as a sub where you have hardly ever a chance to play on stage even in scrims having to alternate players is not practical.   Orgs are either not profitable or barely adding 5 more appealing salaries is impossible.  It’s sad but LoL format is very harsh for subs.
hm6yk4s,firehydrant_man,11/26/2021,1,51.0,talon isnt popular and doesnt sell skinstheyre not even willing to give the man a decent skin wheres hes the main character in the damn splashartand you expect them to fix all these bugs?
hm76xaj,DroPowered,11/26/2021,1,11.0,She’s cute is she single?
hm70lpu,TH3RM4L33,11/26/2021,1,51.0,True its been negative 7 days since the last one.
hm7fkr1,GiannisisMVP,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,Alphari and Humanoid are way better lol
hm8q9we,stuffslols,11/26/2021,1,17.0,Yes. I do. Its happened more often youd believe where a good scaling champ with a horrible early (yasuo kayle senna etc) lost their lane (lack of jungle presence countersink whatever) and came back to carry the game well after that when random skirmishes develop for objectives. This is especially true in lower elos which make up the majority of the games that are played. Thats not even taking into account times when person got accused of inting and the other 4 wanted to ff because said person died one time on accident.  Games almost always cannot be decided at the 15 minute mark. The outcome is much more clear at 20.
hm72pc2,Metaxpro,11/26/2021,1,22.0,Dont even know why players willingly sign multi-year contracts when they know just one bad split/worlds performance and theyre sent to contract gulag right away. Doesnt give them any job security at all just limits their opportunities.
hm7mz2c,TheSilenceMEh,11/26/2021,1,44.0,Yah 2015 PAX really scaled down the LoL  representation compared to previous years. I think 2013 was the best representation of League at PAX. You had NA qualifiers Dominion booth with Phreak shout casting and Teemo hats everywhere.   In 2015 I remember being in line for Halo 5 and hearing that Faker was there and leaving the line to take a look. I think they chose people from the crowd to play a game with him was really cool.
hm86mp6,LelouchtheGreat,11/26/2021,1,159.0,Oh yeah i mained him before the rework
hm8hdna,DHGSilvergun236,11/26/2021,1,1.0,Link to the Straw poll - https://strawpoll.com/gaccgafpz

hm83o29,Moonmight_,11/26/2021,1,126.0,I do want Lillia mainly so I can enjoy her on anything outside of League itself
hm7kykv,Ubique_Sajan,11/26/2021,1,205.0,>I think even the russian server is in germany lol  Correct it is in Munich.
hm6yc0d,haydn132,11/26/2021,1,119.0,He also doxxed streamers in lol... DDOSing litteraly gets u prison time in the US so id say its pretty bad.
hm8mg47,V1pArzZ,11/26/2021,1,17.0,Tahm kench has been topping the winrate charts top for a while now
hm7anft,abokkai,11/26/2021,1,29.0,They had Euros before tho which is > USD
hm75a1s,Tittymotorboat,11/26/2021,1,42.0,Figures as it remains I have yet to see somebody on reddit correctly use the projection buzzword.  Nice attempt though
hm6zo4n,Exclarius,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,> It is the teams responsibility to inform the fans and as a member of the team it is Upsets responsibility to make sure the fans are not left completely in the dark.  From the linked tweet:  > Over the course of two weeks there were two meetings where I had expressed to the team that I was dealing with **severe family issues** that have impacted me deeply. It was only on the night before my departure that the situation at home took a turn for much worse leaving me with no other choice than to leave. I have always been transparent about the severity of the suffering my family was going through.  You do know why he had to leave. Severe family issues should be enough. You do not need to know the exact details. It is not relevant.
hm8r7jn,yeeyeeAssMidlaner,11/26/2021,1,13.0,How do you know that people who downvoted didnt read your post?
hm81r98,Mejalu,11/26/2021,1,11.0,I dont go 0/9 and I dont get mad at something as small as an ff vote. Go outside
hm8675x,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,92.0,If I were to do this again I think my highest win rates to masters would be in that order. Jungle was definitely my most played role but is inflated in games since it was originally an account I played on to warm up on/have fun after a long day (150 games of having fun on kayn).   For my climb to challenger I know support will be my highest w/r role since I also feel its the role that functions most like midlane in a way.
hm7ab5w,Odd_Play_5769,11/26/2021,1,6.0,I want to see some Singed flashbacks and Twitch introduced in some capacity even as a teaser or wink his players would be fine
hm8tswl,butthurt-fanboy,11/26/2021,1,14.0,Sett is kinda strong a pretty usual juggernaut/bruiser.   But tahm he s a tank who doesnt have anything tanks have going for them in terms of lategame tahm has one of the strongest lane and if he s fed he will be a beast and u need 45 seconds of constant fighting to take him down but if he isn t fed he s the strenght of a super minion.  So imo definately tahm is more broken the max HP dmg on hit and the lack of dmg else where makes him hard to balance and a bad design
hm7nb8p,teerude,11/26/2021,1,52.0,Why would you feel a need to put /s? What is wrong with people
hm8mzu3,Wrsow,11/26/2021,1,9.0,all acc on one card and cancel membership after taking stuff
hm7lr3z,Craftingistheway,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Just because they feel that way does not mean their feelings are valid. In fact they just reveal they are to inmature to accept that the managment who has details accepted Upsets reasoning. It doesnt matter one tiny fucking bit of shit what they feel in that case. It isnt for them to decide this is between FNC managment and Upset.   &#x200B  I mean how on gods fucking earth are people STILL to stupid to understand Upsets situation is rather ....unique and not easy when even fucking RICH is DEFENDING FNC. Like why are people to lazy to follow the stuff actually even commeting?!...
hm7ewix,Odd_Play_5769,11/26/2021,1,6.0,It was a joke I thought it was obvious but I guess not.
hm7muqh,Craftingistheway,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Your ability to read is rather dogshit for an accountant. Upset did not say his teammates would weaponize it against him but people in general if the issue would become publicly known.  He has no intetntions of having a tradegy be used as flame on twitch chat 24/7 the entire next year.  &#x200B  And he doesnt have to trust him. He trusted key people in managment.  Tell me about your work enviroment where you can cause an PR drama because you cannot trust the judgment of your boss? because thats Bwipo for ya...
hm74q14,DunkeSchoen,11/26/2021,1,66.0,Pantheon and Morde (? I think) still have their old icons  on discord on the icons when soneone is playing as them. I dont know if its a Riot Games issue or discord.
hm8rqtl,ajisanma,11/26/2021,1,12.0,And Yagao continues to steal paychecks
hm7nqmz,RudeusBluerat,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,As someone who speaks both langages the legal part was a direct translation of legit from where he said: il ny a rien de legit dans le départ dUpset which would translate to something like There is nothing right/legitimate in Upsets departure.  &#x200B  It was a direct translation without context
hm77z18,TheWarmog,11/26/2021,1,42.0,You think too much while knowing little to nothing yet youre judging somebody elses life while being behind a screen   All this for a videogame     You sure youre better than her as you claim to be?

hm8jvt7,doglop,11/26/2021,1,4.0,They actually did say it wasnt cannon(after saying it was) because of the amount of backlash
hm7x938,ILoveWesternBlot,11/26/2021,1,,support in lower elos is not as easy to climb with because you cant consistently rely on your teammates to carry with the advantages you spoonfeed them. Having done my time in low elo playing support I can tell you that spoonfeeding 4 kills and a turret to your vayne wont stop them from tumbling forward in every fight and getting blown up instantly.   Once you climb higher it gets a lot better though
hm709jg,PresentMiddle8974,11/26/2021,1,62.0,Hey congrats on plat. Although king stix is not a very good source of info if you have some time you should just search up builds in eve mains reddit or discord if u want to main her. Those places usually have the most optimal builds for any champs which are backed by high elo one tricks.
hm8am7h,PapiPoggers,11/26/2021,1,8.0,Blabers team has been 100% serious comms. Its hilarious seeing the difference
hm7pe8q,Zuldak,11/26/2021,1,,How would they force him to stay? You cant imprison him and force him onto the stage.
hm85omp,murp0787,11/26/2021,1,143.0,Its just the decent thing to do man.  If you have to take a leave of absence for work it doesnt just fly to be like hey I cant work for a month but I cant tell you anything.  Sorry!  and fuck your coworkers over.  Like most people are going to give some kind of reasoning thats not 100% vague so people get why.  I get not posting it up on social media but he should have at least told his teammates something more specific since it basically ruined their efforts of the past year.

hm7izca,TargonBoi,11/26/2021,1,205.0,I would love the servers to be merged. Imagine how much the competitive soloq level would increase if EUW suddenly got 50% more players. Also finally no need to have two different accounts just to play with friends.

hm7ngy2,Skylam,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,If Adam cant handle FNC being in talks with people for positions every year he shouldnt be in this business. Its a normal thing for every team.
hm7wou1,vegeful,11/26/2021,1,,I been studying the different between corporate culture and their communication. In western corporate culture Upset is correct but on eastern corporate culture he need to give a bit more detail about it.   Their is less privacy for Eastern corporate culture.   Also u are correct not everyone had to know it but does his teammate not count for something? They are not random Dick and Harry. They are your team that help you journey to world.

hm83zyv,Rossw01,11/26/2021,1,291.0,Ya I agree 100% to this played the majority on EUW but Ive climbed EUNE multiple times and its way less toxic EUNE players are too scared to type to you in English
hm7g6dp,ukendtkunst,11/26/2021,1,2.0,I think a way to solve it would be to make it so that it’s only neutral objectives. That way you’re able to counterplay it.
hm89s8z,L2Hiku,11/26/2021,1,166.0,I got popped by something facing a talon the other day... There was no visual or anything. I had flashed to the side or used my spell shield cus I was on sivir and I just died. Idk if it was a hidden ult or what. But there was no reason for it. Lol
hm86qkp,Purplewizzlefrisby,11/26/2021,1,39.0,Please welcome Isekai The Void Dancer  Once a popular backup dancer from Piltover Isekai fell into the void while on holiday in Icathia. He now emerges as a monstrous creature looking to slaughter his foes in preparation for the arrival of something sinister.   *Insert twink in a crop top with vaguely purple markings on his body and six dashes because hes a dancer.*
hm7kjdb,ultimate_spaghetti,11/26/2021,1,63.0,Multi year contracts are a joke
hm7xjp3,mazrrim,11/26/2021,1,,really cba getting into this argument.  I would call adcs the worst overall players at the same elo they look the worse off role whereas you can trust non 1 trick support players to competently play midlane most of the time.   I am talking about in at least d2+ here.
hm7r40e,Bluehorazon,11/26/2021,1,203.0,I mean you could likely play a fasting Viktor or Singed the question though is are they the supports or Senna?
hm6yxs0,GuyOnTheMoon,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,I would argue that Upset’s inaction in his communication led to the twitlonger and flaming of Upset.
hm7nggp,ArmaghedonShadow,11/26/2021,1,252.0,That is bullshit. I have accounts on both servers and EUW is the same if not worse.
hm75jz7,Tittymotorboat,11/26/2021,1,74.0,Doran wasnt top 2 last year neither was Chovy and arguably not even Ruler (I rated deokdam over him).
hm7c7pz,pseudolemons,11/26/2021,1,11.0,Im pretty sure the dude that helped Caitlyn get the potion for vi is going to be twitch.
hm7afr1,Btigeriz,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,The guys who got him there is the most bullshit thing I have heard so far. As if Upset/Hyli wasnt the best botlane in the west. They got there as a team but without Upset I highly doubt they would have gotten as far as they did in playoffs. Nice way to diminish Upsets role to the point you make it sound like he got carried there.
hm83hh1,TH3RM4L33,11/26/2021,1,159.0,Understandable I am sorry for the disturbance.
hm8a7oe,Psychic_Joker,11/26/2021,1,8.0,How are the captain flowers/corejj and blaber’s team perspectives? Because Spica’s stream has been absolutely fucking hilarious so I’d highly recommend it
hm7eg56,ChrisDrake,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,It sounds to me that he abruptly left after he said things took a turn from the worst . So I wouldnt be surprised if the last the team heard from upset was he was going through alot of personal issues  and then he was gone .
hm802ab,kohaku_kawakami,11/26/2021,1,30.0,No LCK teams are participating. Only LCK Challenger League teams are allowed to enter. So since T1 doesnt have a full Challenger Team roster they wont be participating. If the KeSPa Cup allowed for main teams to enter youd bet your ass T1 would participate.

hm7tvoq,murp0787,11/26/2021,1,124.0,People arent entitled but usually its the kind thing to do especially in that situation.  Especially when all thats been given is some vague bullshit feeling reason. He completely fucked his team after 1 year of playing to get to the most important event there is the night before it started. If I was on his team Id be pissed also if I was given some vague reason with no clarity.

hm7az28,NvmSharkZ,11/26/2021,1,157.0,Im stealing that
hm88fn7,bns18js,11/26/2021,1,92.0,>Seraphine has consistently one of the best win rates as adc and its mostly played by off role support players lol.  That just proves the champion is easy to get value out of? Its the same reason why Annie has always held a good winrate in all elos. Thats the opposite of what you want to say. Seraphine usually wins by --- lose lane low CS through out spells in teamfight for easy value and carry that way.  >My mage adc and mid win rates are mostly just as high as support I just like the role more.  Mage ADC is easier than ADC. ADCs need better mechanics to properly kite with. But yes if youre playing mage ADCs at least thats alot harder than playing support.  You as a single person might be an exception to the rule. Maybe youre mechanically insane but you just like how support plays. I can believe that.  The the overall pattern is that the support role is the easiest mechanically and people who play it tend to be the worst compared to others at the same elo. That does not change even if youre an anomaly.  (You still havent addressed the population issue. I assume at least you agree on that front).
hm75q4h,Odd_Play_5769,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,I definitely think its one of those you listed that is assuming it is an actual medical emergency and they arent just saying its that for good PR. Who knows at this point
hm7nyye,olsi995,11/26/2021,1,6.0,People simply dont know how proper macro works. To add something that wasnt mentioned yet if you get a group that listens to calls try getting into the enemy base through the bot lane. Its the lane furthest away from Baron. This allows you more opportunities to get the buff and finish the game or at least take down a good chunk of their base.
hm7avlv,Karpeeezy,11/26/2021,1,39.0,Well yeah but nowhere near the amount theyre getting paid in USD.   Besides the USD is historically the safer currency
hm7ohf6,RemoteAnalysis3809,11/26/2021,1,,>Upsets actions have consequences beyond him  And that could well be why he chooses to stay silent too. From everything I have seen so far the dude is clearly not keeping secrets only for himself.   I personally am willing to tell my coworkers everything about myself but I will not be going around telling my loved ones trauma to my coworkers knowing full well the story may end up on this subs front page ready to be dissected memed and joked about by literally millions of 15yo dudes.   The fact that every single person who knows what exactly went down have come out and expressed support for Upset should tell us there are consequences if Upset spills the beans as well.   Dude made a difficult choice. And I like that he sticks with it till the end despite all the hate towards him and his family.
hm8bg83,Excalidorito,11/26/2021,1,108.0,What was the worst champ to play against in each role and why?

hm7cela,Lahwtiste,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,I wouldnt really insult Adam by saying hes moronic.    He has the right to be frustrated even if its because he cant relate to what Upsets going through. He also has the right to take it the wrong way when he learns that he could be replaced.   Though he acted like a child the moment he spread his own speculation knowing full well that communities will warp that part (that its not a fact) and made public things that should be private.    People saying that what hes done is heroic or good for the scene are just drama hungry ready to sell whatever decency they might have left for a gossip.

hm8byo0,DwooMan5,11/26/2021,1,9.0,At this point in the game a 1/10 pantheon is worth like 173 gold…it doesn’t matter who gets it and the adc would be better off farming if gold is a concern

hm7bal7,wtfisworld,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,Bro just say what it is what the fuk suicide COVID whatever we are all dealing with problems you are not special
hm7ta53,Ahrlin4,11/26/2021,1,61.0,>Why do people like you refuse to listen to pings about bad items? When other people just want to help you learn the game.  Yeah but lets be honest spam pinging an item isnt about helping anyone learn.  If the person doesnt know why Maw is a bad pick pings wont help. They wont know if its a bad item for their specific champ against their specific opponents in their current game state or just in general. Its just flaming someone and expecting them to read your mind as to why.  Also while Maw is indisputably trash people are terrible at accepting even the more viable non-meta items. Ive been spam-pinged for building Randuins on Urgot when there was a hyper-fed Yasuo on the enemy team. Getting pinged is just as likely the other guy being stupid as you making a mistake.

hm89trh,AshesOntheFire778,11/26/2021,1,51.0,Brand probably got too close to Nasus. Nasus ult with q is 200 has 200 range something that people usually dont respect
hm75ak5,BigBadDogLol,11/26/2021,1,3.0,Because this game was the “final straw” to your probably laundry list prior. It just shows the trigger game and “recents” for reflection purposes but they aren’t the sole cause for the punishment

hm8sly1,Forward_Weakness8733,11/26/2021,1,20.0,i reccomend sett garen darius for starters yorick and nasus for splitpush lovers for begginers. Learn how to lane first before trying jungle as well. Maybe try more interesting champs like fiora riven irelia as they are known to be very good solo champions when you improve at the game. If youre willing we can stay in contact for consultation ^^

hm8bwav,Toplaners,11/26/2021,1,165.0,Its so true sometimes. I know what my problem is and I know how I could fix it but I just dont.  Ive been duoing with a friend lately and its really made me aware of it.   Ill see the enemy jgl on the map walking toward me and my friend will say on voice coms hes coming top.  Ill go I know I can out play it because the enemy laner is half hp and Im 3/4 hp.  Fast forward 10 seconds and I go 1 for 1 instead of killing both and go I woulda got them both if I just landed X!  I guess in theory if I keep doing this eventually Ill keep improving until I can make the play even though playing safer would make me climb faster.
hm7mdxv,chachikuad,11/26/2021,1,130.0,Ok random guy768 so it must be impossible to get better at using a fucking mouse and keyboard
hm7m5ti,BurningApe,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,He could have at least given some category of what kind of issue it was Family situation is extremely general. Ill say this again its totally fine to leave for an emergency family situation. However there are only very specific situations where you must leave for an emergency situation and not be able to tell anyone (he didnt even tell all his teammates) we dont matter were the public but it has to be something so specific that he was not even willing to give any information to teammate who was impacted by it:  1. Its an extremely controversial family situation that he wants to hide  2. It was not actually a controversial situation but wasnt something worth ditching the team last minute for - something embarrassing etc. and so he has to hide it in order to save his reputation  1 is far more likely given that based on all the info we know it was serious.  In either case its great for reddits daily dose of drama gossip.

hm7whbm,xHansi,11/26/2021,1,,1.5 hours every day. Are you insane? :D
hm7neka,nighthawk475,11/26/2021,1,,Definitely a good reason :)  I tend to keep quickcast on for every champion and use those shift+ability keys more often on characters Im still learning until I get the hang of them. Certain characters like blitzcrank I tend to use the shift+ability normal cast more than half the time even now when I main him. Its just really helpful but when Im doing that Im taking my time to line up the shot anyway and I dont mind the fact that theres an extra keypress. When Im combing someone with e>q>r (or q>r>e) I can do it without the normal cast and get it out faster instead then making it easier to do without leaving time for them to flash away.
hm7h2ba,Fgame,11/26/2021,1,1301.0,Hyli trusted him because Hyli is older and more mature than the other 3 and IIRC Hyli has a long term relationship as well so it stands to reason hes more familiar with the dynamic than the younger guys.

hm74esu,DomiekNSFW,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,A perfect example of Upsets concerns is the murder of Doublelifts mom. Years later people still make jokes about her getting stabbed and nickname Doublelift based on some anime where the character faced a similar experience.  I have no idea if Upset handled this matter with his teammates in a good way but I absolutely support the notion that teammates/coworkers are not entitled to know the details of your private life. Especially with the potential for a leak to millions of people.

If youre at plat level most of the time and youre rocking something you play at bronze level you are hurting your team...but theres no other way to learn a champion so LoL literally forces you to be toxic.

hm70ys9,puhtoinen,11/26/2021,1,141.0,As a former no-life CS:GO player russians having their own server is definitely a good thing. Theres way too many people in Russia who either cant or dont want to speak english. While thats not as big of a hindrance in LoL than it is in CS:GO they generally do not play well together with foreigners atleast based on my personal experiences.
hm8qvnc,BoltzmannCurve,11/26/2021,1,12357.0,I mean its clear they outsourced for the story here
hm762bu,zod2ac,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,And you see a lot of people here demanding the exact reasons and demanding Upset a lot when you dont know how youre going to act in that state of mind.
hm72w9u,Kharn_LoL,11/26/2021,1,73.0,I mean if you want you can find some ProView VODs of his last years as a pro when he was injured and had to take months off. In my opinion he was still doing things that nobody else does to this day his mouvement patterns are just out of this world.

hm7srpt,TheDiabeticGM,11/26/2021,1,68.0,I dont know anything about League so hearing this actually makes me even more excited for Arcane.

hm7pinc,IG_Royal,11/26/2021,1,,Whats your argument to prove this point? Id argue TheShy was indisputable as the best toplaner in the world for 2 straight seasons while Smeb always had Duke CuVee and Ssumday in close company

hm6zzi4,lemonrabbits,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,So youre telling me if Adam went to Upset and straight up said Hey if you dont tell me about your family emergency I will make a twitlonger about your situation you think Upset is going to all of a sudden tell Adam and trust him? Ofc not.   Imagine wanting to tell someone something super confidential and private because if you dont they will write a twitlonger about you.
hm71njn,Sarazam,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Also he says that he told Yamato what happened but from [this video]( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jJQqz80qF2w&t=1366s) Yamato talks about Upset leaving. When talking about Upset leaving he said that he knows it must be super important because Upset is a competitor and would not give up and leave for nothing. If Yamato knew the reasons wouldn’t he be phrasing it as “Upset told why he considered leaving and I knew he needed to go home and deal with it.” Not to psycho analyze too much but it feels like Yamato doesn’t know much and is rationalizing that it must be super important because Upset wouldn’t just leave the team.
hm7jnih,TrixieH,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,His post in French was already a mess grammatically speaking so Id not be surprised if the english translation is messed up too - didnt read it. Anyway Adams post was a big dick move.

hm6ybou,NeonGIGA,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Just because something terrible has happened doesnt mean you have to spend every waking second not playing league or focusing on the situation at hand honestly had he not touched league people would still be critical and theyd probably call him lazy for not playing a second of league whatsoever.

hm7smw3,DrLuciferZ,11/26/2021,1,110.0,HBO/Warner may own a lot of interesting IPs but for the most part when shows go viral it seems to be Netflix(Squid Game Arcane etc) and/or Disney(Wandavision Madalorian etc). All HBO has done is pissed off directors and actors on their hybrid release.

hm8o0rw,mikecrosoft99x,11/26/2021,1,2.0,Yeah I watched his video. I was laughing so hard when he was reacting to the entire league roaster lol
hm7ue6r,curiouscuriousmtl,11/26/2021,1,120.0,The day I heard from Riot August that the designers are actually coding their champions in what sounds like some kind of scripting language was the day I realized this whole thing must be a complete mess.
hm79y8g,kazuyaminegishi,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,False assumption that the word emergency doesnt mean... emergency?  The rest of your comment is just long-winded nonsense. If you create a fictional scenario where your paranoid nonsense is justified then you can warp the meaning of any situation.   I could easily say oh but what if Upsets wife was assaulted by someone outside their home and she feels unsafe at home and shes traumatized and claim that Im right. I have no idea what happened and I dont need to know what happened. To him it was an emergency thats all thats important.  If my mom called me and told me my grandmother was dying I wouldnt take off work nor would I find that an emergency because I dont like my grandmother. However if your grandmother raised you and shes the most important person in your life then this would be an emergency for you. Using my personal viewpoint I could say whatever people die all the time and yet that doesnt make it not an emergency for you.  The fact he described it as an emergency for himself makes it an emergency for himself. Re-explaining what he did using long-winded synonyms is stupid because youve convinced yourself that the phrase family emergency is meaningless. If Adam doubts him Adam is free to do so. But the issue isnt in how the problem was presented its that Adam just doesnt believe him.
hm7hb4t,TINPTH,11/26/2021,1,184.0,And how do you feel about people from eastern Europe moving to western countries?
hm7loxx,LazerFruit,11/26/2021,1,62.0,Probably upset with how worlds went or wanted changes that the org didnt want to make
hm7vv5p,ezprodigy,11/26/2021,1,252.0,are you aware merging western and eastern european in one server that requires communication have pretty much always resulted in flame wars?
hm8q53s,Miyaor,11/26/2021,1,5.0,Apparently just landed
hm7lm7w,danielloking_,11/26/2021,1,205.0,I suspect an American who once again has no idea what theyre talking about when it comes to Europe.   I occasionally play on EUNE and most of the people playing on that server write in (scuffed) English just like EUW.   Im not saying English is a common language in any of the countries part of EUNE in fact apart from England Ireland Scottland etc. no country in Europe has English as its most common language. Europeans just tend to speak multiple language due to good education and English is pretty much mandatory in most European countries.
hm6zq5h,Jufft,11/26/2021,1,188.0,Itll be on core hes twitch page it looks like.
hm8mho9,Umarill,11/26/2021,1,15.0,Can I ask you why you are in literally every single thread on this subreddit commenting random stuff followed by :3? Only people I see use this are creepy Discord mods and creepy anime fans pretty much.   You have like hundreds of comments a day doing that I truly wonder why.
hm7k6yb,-LostInCloud-,11/26/2021,1,,>If I treat my wife like shit and she leaves me that doesnt allow me to say I guess I was right to treat her like shit since she left me.  Thats true.   I think in this situation though someone that even after bad blood does shit like Adam and Bwipo did... not sure. Would not trust them. Even IF Upset didnt give them the deserved trust and respect their reaction would not have been appropriate.
hm7kyjt,SNSDave,11/26/2021,1,2.0,Yes that is where it comes from.

hm8d1dv,noahkillis,11/26/2021,1,128.0,Lucian taught me how to move ever so slightly when aaing so my auto attacks would focus enemy champs or minions. also spell weaving and not wasting the double autos. Countless times have I been saved by e - aa - w - aa - q - aa combo.

hm73kpc,KvotheM,11/26/2021,1,42.0,Out of curiosity what do you think is misogynistic about what I said? Because everything would stay the same if the genders were reversed.
hm6xtj7,throwawayaccountdown,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,No I need an update from Adam as well. /s
hm8m2d8,keithstonee,11/26/2021,1,6.0,For #4. Invulnerable isnt untargetable.  If it says invulnerable it shouldnt drop aggro. You just wouldnt take damage from turret while invulnerable.  Idk if thats intended for eve specifically or not. But if thats the wording that doesnt seem like a bug to me.
hm6yxeo,BDNjunior,11/26/2021,1,277.0,All amazing champs. Keep drooling and playing champs like garen. So much fun to play and against. Stop bitching or quit playing. The game is evolving and every champ isnt fun to fight against.
hm8807p,TH3RM4L33,11/26/2021,1,159.0,Could I see the replays as well?
hm70fnc,xxtuddlexx,11/26/2021,1,141.0,Kind of funny from a NA perspective how in theory it sounds awesome being able to play with people who speak tons of different languages and are from different places than here. Since we have probably 99% english then some Spanish Chinese and French from quebec. But Im sure about 4 games of EU toxicity would make me want to dig a hole in kentucky and never leave the country lol.
hm7fvsj,Poughy14,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,I dont get it when you play sport / eSport at a competitive level you share a bond with your teammates I dont understand why a grow up man cant take 5 min to talk to his teammates before leave the biggest competition of the year.   Its courtesy at least.   I had a coworker (so not even close as a teammate) lose his father right before one of the most important meeting for a company. Of coure we let the guy go. Just act as grown up.  I think its more shady from upset side.   None the less the harassing from the community is terrible
hm805w0,PankoKing,11/26/2021,1,2.0,Please dont do this. We will ban you
hm6zwaa,HawksFanKennesaw,11/26/2021,1,65.0,The eyes are a bit too much for me. Didnt he have Grey eyes?  The gaunt face and ensemble are nice. Feeling is off.
hm7of79,FuujinSama,11/26/2021,1,,He mentions that comment in that exact video.  Apparently one of the players Upset trusted leaked it to him. Just goes to show that Upset shouldve been even more paranoid.
hm85jpi,Rustifer66642069,11/26/2021,1,4.0,Maybe not carried but greatly impacted the game
hm8iwiq,LazerFruit,11/26/2021,1,1.0,Kayn is usually a fine solo queue pick because he can fill the role of either assassin or draintank depending on meta/matchups
hm8t1eg,JeffLocos,11/26/2021,1,139.0,Congrats bro! I still remember the first time I got to Play its no small feat! Now on to diamond am I right?
hm78med,Vangorf,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Exactly. If Upset wouldve said to FNC that he fucked Adams/Nisqys Worlds lets keep them on the roster to give them another chance then its fine but he legit said Adam is not up to his standards. Like bruh he went to World in a split from ERL. How many years did it took for Upset to get there? Fuck his standards and his behaviour.
hm78tpa,Reddit12btw,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Yet he keeps coming to twitter saying he wont say anything for the 3rd time
hm7ybcg,MiniatureEvil,11/26/2021,1,156.0,Your friend has 90 IQ
hm6yiwp,HowTooPlay,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Yes he shared DETAILS with them thats the key word. His teammates only knew that it was severe family issues. Yamato and Javi knew the details of the issues.  His teammates shouldnt need to know every detail: Adam Bwipo and Nisqy should be more like Hyil and just understand that severe family issues is enough information.
hm83kgt,Ebobab2,11/26/2021,1,63.0,Youre not entitled to get a perfect match.   Thats it. Youre only entitled to get a game of League of Legends. Which is 99% of all times just RNG when you solo play.  If you want perfect matches then League is not it. Its either becoming pro or just playing actual good games that have a singleplayer focus
hm7fl0h,akutasame94,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,I find Rich talking about it very funny tho rofl HEre we have Uspet claiming he told 2 people in FNC and asked that no one else was told other than Hily who didnt want to tell anyone but out of all people Rich knows shit so someone had to have told him
hm7k2oz,TrixieH,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Its actually the same issue in sports too. If someone like Mbappé makes a foul commentators especially those from M6 will somehow find a way to make it look like its the opponents fault. This mentality sucks big.
hm71nve,SupportStronk,11/26/2021,1,141.0,Pretty sure its in Amsterdam not Rotterdam
hm8034j,byeolToT,11/26/2021,1,13.0,In my experience people are nice but the smallest Thing can turn them into a toxic person. Even if you are nice in chat they somehow dont like it and become toxic
hm8ii6c,Tilterino247,11/26/2021,1,,Which is my whole first statement that you argued with? Teams dont care about winning. Double lift Jensen was a free trip to worlds for literally any team. But they dont care about winning.
hm7onw7,dragunityag,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,His wife was playing too from what people were saying. So still possible but also plummets the chances if true.

I am really interested in Pyke but am not sure where he fits best. I have seen some people use him in bot as a support assassin some run mid and some jungle. I am just not sure where he is best utilized any help is greatly appreciated.
hm7mjf6,Zuldak,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Most people are ok releasing general information eg death in the family serious sickness etc.   Leaving worlds 12 hours before it starts really whittles down to only a handful of circumstances that could justify his leaving.   Frankly it looks like he has some lame excuse like Adam says and upset is trying to hide because he knows how pathetic he will look

hm762eu,rudebrooke,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Youre talking to teenagers most of the time remember.   Anyone with any kind of critical thought would understand that the situation warranted him leaving. If it didnt Fnatic would have released him because theyre not in the business of paying someone for a year in order to make worlds and then just have them leave last minute.   Anyone who thinks Adam - a guy who Upset has known and played with for about 3 months at that point - deserves to know the intimate details of Upsets familys personal life are completely out of touch.
hm7vynp,Cyanide-ky,11/26/2021,1,3.0,As a support main I hate when they get away I’ll give you a chance to get it but if it even looks like  they might get away I’m gunna kill them

hm7d5ol,Dotsngo,11/26/2021,1,,Maybe he would maybe he wouldnt but in that case he would be getting all the heat and people wouldnt have sided with him. Not that I care Upset has right to his privacy as much as Adam had right to speak up 2 PoVs and I would feel extremely shitty being any of them.
hm7ijc7,supejeroeno,11/26/2021,1,,Ahh yes when a family member is in a severe situation where they end up in a hospital just keep playing your gaming tournament for a bit and hope it ends well. Of course he himself probably couldn’t solve what was going on but at times like this it is often just about being there for each other. You have to be 12 to think this is a reasonable line of thought.

hm79dyw,comso20,11/26/2021,1,1054.0,> why the fk u wont trust ur teammates?  because they might not be friends? maybe he trusts them with playing the game but goes i dont trust them not to put this on social media which considering Adam went and spilled shit all over social media the second he was out of Fnatic might have been justified.  > just a vogue one is enough u dont need a really permission just let them know its very urgent if u wont do that how tf they got the urgency  Considering we as the public got a vuage statement stressing the urgency Id assume that management and coaches probably gave a vauge explination to the players as well. he literally did exactly what you asked but is getting flamed.
hm7mier,hochan17,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,And yet here we are with 3 people saying that was the case. I think the most likely scenario is that Upset didnt say anything to the team and just told management like how you would in a real job. However staff didnt properly convey the severity of the situation and now were here with this mess
hm6yolw,Key_Divide3166,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,umh American... people who speak English in a foreign country while the rest of the world makes the effort to learn the local language...
hm7qlqn,DangerousSeaweed0,11/26/2021,1,1569.0, he said that prior to worlds  he would always leave because his wife was lonely.  so upset already as the precedent of leaving for that reason in upsets eyes. he also said that hes not certain its the same situation again  but as i said....precedents
hm8rcx8,Moomookus_,11/26/2021,1,118.0,I really dont get why people are calling this GenG team a super team I think the team is good but its no where near a super team I just dont think people even remember what a super team is. KT 2017 was a super team you take arguably the best player in each role and bring them together GenG has only two players you could argue are best in their role (Ruler&Chovy) and even then I think its not the strongest argument when you have Showmaker and Gumayusi or even Teddy or Deokdam. This is a good roster but this is not what a super team is by definition.
hm7lbkf,northerncass,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,>No you’re completely not understanding at all.  yeah yeah ive heard this already. clearly no one understands the situation but the people who dont like what upset did. we get it youre super smart because youre the only one who gets it  >I personally don’t care but it’s undeniable that the situation was handled poorly and created hate and drama.  yep someones personal issues deserved hate thrown their way by who knows how many people online! sounds like a sane and reasonable take.   >I’m very successful at it because I communicate openly.  normally people who arent insecure or are actually doing well dont have to make it a point to state theyre in fact actually doing VERY well. maybe you can relate to adam because youre both insecure 🤷

hm76i0l,xiyeonah,11/26/2021,1,188.0,TF Blade believe it or not when he first started streaming obviously didnt have the same ego he has now. He was legitimately the most skilled prospect when he was hitting rank 1 with garbage champions like Irelia and Akali pre-rework. I think he got too carried away with his global rank 1 challenge and just lost any professional aspirations. Maybe now he seems toxic in a team environment but maybe if he started with no ego he could have turned out different.   Right now there is  Sniper who is a young prospect that could probably keep streaming rather than go pro as well. Its just that because NA streaming is so lucrative that its not as appealing to become a professional. Streaming is a much more comfortable lifestyle so if NA truly doesnt have a chance to win Worlds then I could see why prospects turn away from professional play and build their brand. Like Blade is definitely making way more money right now with his Twitch and Youtube than he would be competing in the LCS unless he literally became the best top in NA.

hm7tzw3,Lahwtiste,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Bwipo and adam say that they got told of his departure 12 hours before the start. What Upset said doesnt really contradict what they said since he said that he took the decision to leave when the situation got worse which was the day before worlds started.   They were probably aware that he wasnt well because of some issues as it was told in their worlds BTS video then again by Upset and again by dardo but they probably werent aware that it could end up with Upsets departure.   Unless Ive missed something where someone says word for word that at no point they were aware till the last moment what they all said still checks out.
hm76f6f,Gackin,11/26/2021,1,13.0,Ive always said that them removing stealth wards from the store was a mistake.

hm785uy,moroheus,11/26/2021,1,42.0,You immediately jumped to the conclusion that Upset got cheated on but there is nothing that points to that. So that idea must come from somewhere else. Youre projecting you fear of being cheated and your misogyny into that situation.  So that is 80€ for the first session and 50€ for every additional. You wanna pay in cash or by card?
hm713ol,Naerlyn,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,1) Lmao yeah no he doesnt give a fuck he left Worlds to go back to his girl   2) Lmao youve already got someone in the team who hovers his girls main for 30 seconds during every draft stop that bro its Worlds respect your teammates and the most serious one ends up teamless for 24€  Those are Kametos tweets the other three were deleted.

hm6yrng,Chao_Zu_Kang,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Even if that is true it has no relation to the issue at hand. Hopefully. But lets not get into some weird conspiracy theory about someone blackmailing Upset with something she did in the past to not play at Worlds...
hm7gp31,Odd_Play_5769,11/26/2021,1,6.0,That will make him a nightmare late game when hes already broken enough. Give him W more frequently and jts over.
hm7rdyg,Nymwhen,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Totally agree. Communication isnt always about saying details at all. It can be about looking people in the eye and showing u care. That u were thinking about them too. If you connect honestly to people they will give trust.   I think upset was just not able to give his teammates the required headspace they deserved in the moment.  His head was full of his own worries and he prob didnt handle it well in the moment. Wasnt thinking “what can I do to leave the team in an okay state”. Which is understandable when you are in a crisis but still a bit shitty.  But even after he never seemed to have reached out to his teammates. And their resentment just grew with everything else adding on top. And with no communication and a trust that was completely withered away in the end Adam could only see upset as the villain. And even convinced himself he left for nothing. His lash out was just very unfortunate for everyone.   Fnatic managment shouldve gotten everyone in the same room. I think just talking to eachother wouldve solved it.
hm6zcsv,Dajoeman,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Exactly

hm7ethg,rizefall,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,He told the Fnatic management what was going on and asked to leave. The teammates themselves doesnt need to fully know what happened if Upset doesnt want them to only the management does.  Its also not weird to ask your new franchise/star player what kind of people hed like to play with. He got asked he gave his opinion.  Adam is just being a big baby talking about stuff he knows nothing about.
hm7mll9,Spitfire836,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,If I were in Upset’s place then yes I would expect to lose a portion of my privacy and would have told my teammates at the very least that there was an emergency and gone into a little detail about it (something that he did not do). You don’t have to go into every possible detail but a little more than just “family emergency” which is not even what he said to his teammates.   And also this could have easily been avoided if he has just been honest with his teammates from the start. The whole reason this blew up is because he was being “shady” about it. If he had just told his team what happened then they would have told everyone that he had an emergency and none of this would have blown up.
hm6y6jh,BurningApe,11/26/2021,1,28.0,Translating the lyrics was odd but you explained at the end this is some diehard fan emo stuff haha. I understand that its gonna be the end of FPX but idunno if it warrants this big of a deal (especially from a fan perspective). Im sure theres gonna be some emotional turmoil especially from Crisp side as he was personally on the team of tightly-knit friends but I mean in reality nothing is over right they will continue to work towards a better future. This exact same thing has probably happened to so many other teams so many other players.  Maybe this is just cultural difference:  1. I understand why he is emotional  2. Dont understand why he needs to share it so much people go through this all the time yes even in a commoners life. I think this is the reason why I can never be a diehard fan we all have the people close to us in our lives and lonely people who require more attention yet here we are in this day and age always chasing after stars who get enough care and love as it is. This is no jab at Crisp but just in general at how idol culture even in America.  3. Dont understand why fans are so emotional but Ive never been a diehard fan so who am I to judge -> this is just me being an ass       That said I fully respect the fan culture and Crisp expressing his sentiments. Thanks for translating everything!

hm7c52j,Agreeable_Junket_271,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,no you cant. one has connotation associated with it. you can narrow down the scope quite considerably. on the other hand family emergency gives you literally nothing to work with

hm7mlyj,c9haiondrugs,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Serious question. Do you not see the parallels between this and being sick?  lets not pretend when someone says im not feeling good before an important day  theyre not looked at in the exact same light.   If a kid says hes feeling good and fakes a cough are we going to burn the parents at the stake for not buying it knowing theres a 50% chance they just dont wanna go to school?   So yes we can respect not feeling good or family emergency but it does raise some eyebrows and if you want to keep it private you need to do it in a way that comes off sincere to the people who put their trust in you.
hm83udp,Bloodyfoxx,11/26/2021,1,291.0,As a ex euw I hate playing on jp server it just seems like most games at least 1 person doesnt care about the game. When you get 10min queue to play a game where the outcome is decided by a coin it isnt really fun. Id take euw toxicity back everyday.
hm85voo,Jiffyyy,11/26/2021,1,143.0,there is a perceived decent thing to do from both sides and one will lead to the other not happening.  for his teammates the decent thing to do is respect his wishes to remain private on the situation by his choice.  from Upset it would be to give clarity for what happened so his teammates can have closure.  at the end of the day its not up to the players on whether he talks about it its up to Upset.

Ok buddy ? grow the fuck up and understand its his career he couldve been sacked - he ruined his team chances at world. Hes not fucking flipping burgers somewhere.     People even say they were playing LoL togetherr when he was supposed to have his first match
hm8t38j,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,182.0,I hit rank 52 in season 4 but challenger was only 50 slots. I started in S3 and hit challenger for the first time in S6.  I watched so many vods watched SO MANY DOPA VODS. I also had good teammates I could play with that helped me learn more but I was already challenger by then. I think for learning theres so many good public information out there like skillcapped and what not that you can find on youtube. My favorite off meta champ is probably kindred/singed mid.
hm7ngoi,SaulJoker,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Upset wanting to play with a different top laner doesn’t have anything to do with Upset’s situation at worlds.  You’re painting it as if Adam was justified for saying what he said when he wasn’t.  Sure obviously Adam is not going to be happy with his teammate who left during worlds and also wants to replace him. But that doesn’t really change Adam talking shit about his teammates and Fnatic.  Adam is salty that he got replaced and was never told the details of what happened with Upset. But Adam doesn’t have the right to force himself to stay on a team that doesn’t want him nor does he have the right to pry into other people’s private lives.  If you stopped to think about the multitude of terrible things that could have happened to Upset’s family you’d realize that Adam is in the wrong here.
hm8r1dn,Tocharian,11/26/2021,1,9.0,Well thats unlikely to happen given that person would have to accept your friend request in the first place for you to send them gifts. If someone stats sending me multiple RP gifts out of the blue Im writing a ticket to Riot support.

But the thing is that perfectly harmonized is a really tricky topic to begin with and its true in some ways and wrong in others but that is like... a big discussion
hm7bd66,Reddit12btw,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,not a chance he played league with his wife 48h after leaving worlds lmao  Saying miscarriage suicide or whatever the shit would happen they wouldnt be playing league for hours 2days after he left since she would be held in hospital if anything like that happened.
hm7ls72,c9haiondrugs,11/26/2021,1,1428.0, TBH it be better if he took a year off from LEC.Like Bwipo alluded to if Upset quits because of a sudden emergency needs attention that requires him to fly away from worlds and play aram then FNC shouldve also encouraged Bwipo to leave too. Bwipo wanted to quit after hearing Upset quit because he was also mentally distraught after finding out about the situation on top of the fact he missed his girlfriend at home. But thats when it goes too far. Bwipo is encouraged to manage his burdens but Upset gets a pass?   He shouldnt get harassed but he doesnt get a pass either. And I think its ridiculous he would have any input on the roster after abandoning them at the most important time and creating the roster collapse domino starting with Bwipo.  If Upset pulls  the same thing next year is it acceptable? If we find out every time hes away from home for 2+ weeks and him being MIA is impacting those close to him in a bad way? Not a big deal as they probably wont make worlds but still.
hm7n19o,Grand-Garlic,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Right? Why is everyone making this about the community when it’s his teammates he fucked over. People can’t seem to grasp the idea that 4 of his teammates were fucked over in this situation.

hm73s04,RemoteAnalysis3809,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Im part of the community and I think Upset is a Chad for not succumbing to the public outrage and prioritizes his loved ones health and privacy over internet bullshit.  Adam and Bwipo can stay salty. Theyre not the ones getting backed by their employer.

hm8al1j,Yetti2Quick,11/26/2021,1,113.0,Congrats man! This is actually the first year I got plat also and I’m still climbing hard almost to P2 now. I gave up on this year and basically got tilted and started only playing Xerath ADC to at least enjoy myself and piss my teammates off. Fking went on some massive streaks and was able to finish the season plat 4. Won like 70% of my matches over the last 50 games to end. Funny enough the only games I usually lost was when my team got Tilted in champ select from me picking Xerath ADC and then they int the game for us. “Losing cuz no real AD” is the best thing to see when you’re winning 70% or ur games and the enemy adc is 3-10 every game. Lolol.

Especially when you don’t have the time to make an announcement like this yourself.
hm7jx9l,PM_ME_FUTA_PEACH,11/26/2021,1,555.0,Did I get scammed out of a twitch prime capsule or something? Got a free trial last month around this time and claimed the October capsule it never refreshed and I cant claim the Nov one.

hm7u284,KonaKonaChan,11/26/2021,1,17.0,Could you go a little more in-depth as to why you think that the order is like that? Many people (i.e. Dopa) say that climbing with support is the easiest role since it requires less mechanical skill. Do you think that is not the case?
hm81x2t,H4xDefender,11/26/2021,1,558.0,the best (worst?) part about working with certainlyT is that you never knew whether he was joking or serious

hm73kmi,Nicolu_11,11/26/2021,1,2.0,Worlds skins dont affect normal skins production so you can just wait to mid-2022 to see which one of the 3 moonboi skins you prefer (Nightbringer new or EDG).   If you like Nightbringer and want to play with that skin then go ahead though.

hm7osms,ShibbiesClimax,11/26/2021,1,3.0,How would you change it? People go bot because bot laners are lower level and getting your main source of damage ahead or their main source of damage behind is obviously good

hm7wxr8,Hope_u_hav_a_gud_day,11/26/2021,1,246.0,Ivern won’t change unless they allow for his late game to be more rewarding.  Season 10 ivern was perfect IMO.  I could survive the early and scale in the mid to late game.  No points of iverns kit do you feel powerful during the game.  His late game power spike gets mitigated by serpents fang hard.  I haven’t touched the game in a while.  It’s just not fun to see a champion get nerfed into the ground.  No compensations buffs at all.  It’s sad to see enchanter support items be so bad that you can’t do well unless your base numbers are crazy good.  Playing other games is way more enjoyable IMO.
hm7wedc,kenzomon,11/26/2021,1,1.0,It doesnt have to do with Ziggs hitbox but rather with elevation. Jhin is higher up on the map so the shot is actually lower than it looks in game. Its a pretty annoying feature of the game but you can go into practice tool and try it yourself.   Theres a pretty clear shot that looks like its going straight through the practice dummy but doesnt count as a hit. That being said as the person casting the spell you need your cursor to be pretty far off of the dummy when casting so it makes sense that the spell doesnt hit. Visually though it will still look like a hit.
hm7bfdc,MartDiamond,11/26/2021,1,11.0,The Zed Shen Jhin arc seems like a great series.  Noxus vs Demacia.  Shurima and the Void.
hm6yoji,Fleeing_Sunlight,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Look your coworkers dont need to know why youre taking a leave of absence other than that it was a personal/medical issue that is significant enough that it requires you to be take time off.  The issue is that it doesnt seem like this was conveyed at all to the teammates who are upset at the situation or that or the general tone of why Upset had to leave was downplayed to them and that the reason why he left was stupid (his wife was lonely?).   Literally he could have just sent a group text to the team during his plane ride back home apologizing and that the issue was significant enough that he has to leave and that probably would have sufficed.
hm8o2ef,Covefiel93,11/26/2021,1,134.0,i mean 5 years and you just made it to platinum... i was hitting d4 by season 3
hm8ry42,memeoi,11/26/2021,1,188.0,Doesn’t 2 apply to Jax as well? His q goes on cooldown upon cast even if it does no dmg? I thought that was intended as it still provides mobility similar to talon. Wouldn’t that be broken if you could use q to gap close to someone who zhonyas then instantly q again?
hm7d5tc,xXDaNXx,11/26/2021,1,,Reddit detectives here with the classic dog tier take.   You realise a pro player whos spent half a decade grinding league  could quite possibly play video games as a way to cope / de-stress.   Its not fucking inconceivable.

hm7ap8z,zaplayer20,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,Shows a bit of his personality. While Upset is a great ADC to me it smells like Forgiven attitude and lets not forget Forgiven was in the end forgotten. I do understand that family issues shouldnt be told to anybody even work collegues or teammates but the way he left it was like intentional. If the heat was already on before his departure than it means he was a drama queen who maybe didnt wanted to be at worlds. Looking at Perkz he had the balls and courage to tell his teammates why he left and it isnt the only case of players leaving for a few days or weeks in the middle of the tournament. Also the fact that he wanted to change everybody except Hylli means that he was part of a toxic environment that may or may not be caused by himself. I dont use twitter nor harass him i am just saying my opinions based on what the trio write in their TL. I also cant forget that in 2020 with Origen something similar happened Origen imploded in summer because of a certain figure... it can be Alphari or it could have been Upset. I tend to believe it was Upset because he wanted to get rid of Destiny and got Jacktroll which we all know how it ended.
hm7bhdj,TH3RM4L33,11/26/2021,1,65.0,Nope its still there. Rare though.
hm7u3hz,rudebrooke,11/26/2021,1,6.0,Well reddit has been screaming for more NA representation for a while now Id expect you guys to all be cheering for CLG next season considering this team is 4/5 NA with the only import being moved up from a year in Academy (obviously not here to retire or steal a paycheque did prove he was better than his NA rookie counterparts) the coaching staff is NA and theyve been very vocal about developing NA players in academy and the amateur scene.  Youre right that its not going to be easy but I think if people showed support for these young players it would be a good start.

hm7d0zl,ApplePitou,11/26/2021,1,3.0,New Lethal Tempo is very strong now on champions like Trynda or Gwen additionally Axiom Arc it is now a very powerful item that makes the game vs assassins like Zed Talon or Qiyana really problematic :3

I believe that Ive done all that I possibly can google hasnt helped much. I tried the Hextech tool and my ping seemed to improve but then immediately went into the upper echelons of 200ms. Is there a magic button I can press to make my ping come down to where I can actually play the game? (p.s. my wifis not the issue would connect to ethernet but my laptop does not have an ethernet port)

hm85p73,blackrifleenthusiast,11/26/2021,1,25.0,That’s how Udyr works. If he is even or ahead against ANY champ (yes any) he will win 1v1 especially if he is tiger stance. Tiger Udyrs damage is actually insane throughout the entire game. With AD bruiser items his DOT will do about 1k damage every 3 autos. This lets him duel the likes of Jax Fiora Yi provided he has a lead.  That being said he is pretty much useless if he’s behind in gold (tiger) and xp (Phoenix). If he’s Phoenix stance he’s a lot easier to duel because usually Udyr players build Phoenix full tank. Either stance has a relative power trough at lvl 6 when duelists unlock powerful ults and Udyr gets nothing. That is his most vulnerable point and when you should look to be fighting

hm7yjwi,garenRoutplay,11/26/2021,1,8.0,Its aram. You play to learn champsyou play champs you are too bad at to play in soloque or you play for dpm. Playing to win in aram is just lowif you have to go you type it. Unspoken rules of aram.
hm8ag5y,Raijin_End,11/26/2021,1,113.0,I care and Im proud of you. Congratulations
hm8ca9k,Dark4legenD,11/26/2021,1,3.0,Well it’s updated a lot so visually doesn’t feel like it’s lacking and it’s an easy game to fall back into especially once you’ve already a lot
hm7txro,Ok-Travel-7875,11/26/2021,1,105.0,Even if iG got those 1-2 magical autos and won the game KT would have still gotten more done in that game alone than both FNC & G2 did in their series combines. Those teams were *never* in a position to come even close to a win.   iG outclassed KT for sure but those 2 teams were in their own tiers compared to the dogshit that we saw in semis.
hm89ixd,Gazskull,11/26/2021,1,7.0,\- Sincerly someone that complains even when a bunch health and ap are released
hm7kgzo,Gromchoices,11/26/2021,1,114.0,The thing is that’s how I imagine every single Shaco player thinks and imo it’s just cringe. My strat is just to ignore the champ for the entire game unless I know it’s the real one then kill them.   I play Sylas so unless he gets fed he won’t kill me. then it turn the Shaco player gets mad playing a useless champ that can’t carry slowly watching his team lose while all he can do is BM and Q R away…. Only to be ignored.

hm7hmtw,Jiffyyy,11/26/2021,1,74.0,> but his teammates sure as fuck did  no his teammates wanted to know. they had no right to know into his personal life.  would it make things easier to understand for them? yes.  does that mean he is forced to give any details of his personal life? no.   Hell if you were to call in to work because of a tragic death in the family would you say hey boss my mom got ran over yesterday while crossing the street after getting some groceries I dont think I can make it?  no you simply say there is a serious personal matter you need to tend to.  if you cant respect peoples boundaries and attack them for it Im not sure what else to say.  and he gave them the reason. they simply are not in the need to know of the details.
hm7anbl,Melodias07,11/26/2021,1,84.0,To add to that in DRX worlds run it was more of pyosik 0830 show.
hm78qq9,Jiffyyy,11/26/2021,1,42.0,>you didnt tell me what was wrong so I cant trust you and dont want to work with you anymore and it be perfectly fine.   thats their own problem. Upset just needs to tell them there is a personal problem and he needs to leave to deal with it. they dont need to know the details because all they would do with them is judge him and determine if they personally feel that he should care for his personal life which is pointless because they have a biased view being the players on the team wanting to play so they would want him to stay.
hm77qms,Tittymotorboat,11/26/2021,1,74.0,You would think Chovy hasnt been BTFO in every relevent best of 5 hes ever played with the way people  talk about him.

hm7268t,Miyaor,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,ADAM had a right to know more than the nothing he was given. He doesnt need to be given the nitty gritty details but he does deserve to know something as a teammate.   Us redditors dont. Neither does anyone else. Yet the event was apparently not private enough to stop fucking Rich from knowing about it so... Teammates got their dreams dashed by Upset leaving. They deserved more than what they got.

hm79iqz,Amsement,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,Theres not really a right answer that would leave both sides satisfied. Having the opportunity you spent so much time towards dashed away without an explanation would leave most people really unsatisfied and/or bitter. At the same time Upset has the right to not disclose specifics to anyone he doesnt want knowing.  I dont know how anyone on the outside can reasonably take sides without having the actual context.   I will say that these twitlongers are rarely ever a good idea. They dont serve any real purpose as people that dislike you enough to harass you on social media arent going to stop just because you explain yourself. Like Adams tweet is mostly stuff he should have just written in a diary or something not gone public with.
hm75etc,Zerwurster,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,For real. Upset worked closely with them for months and decided he couldnt trust most of them.  Somehow that means Upset is in the wrong because 3>1.  Isnt it more likely in their time together Upset made a couple of experiences with his teammates that justify his behavior?  Like some young and heated guys without any real filter like Adam and Bwipo simply being not trustworthy to such a great extend?  3 teammates are mad at him and only 1 is on his side that means they are right! Or maybe 3 teammates had their tiltlevel exceed their capability for empathy and now we are where we are.  FNC wouldnt keep Upset if they had reason to believe he was unreasonable in his decisions and is likely to repeat what happend at worlds.
hm6yfw1,LionePRO,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,even on instagram sorry if i bring this example here but there are people who say penaldo or pessi...wtf you can say ronaldo/messi is the best to me but messi/ronaldo is the best in these categories

hm79g57,Carpax,11/26/2021,1,1054.0,They are all telling the truth though. Upset specifically states he didnt disclose the exact reasoning behind the family emergency to anyone but yamato. He wanted to tell Hylli as well but he didnt feel he needed to know he trusted Upsets judgement.

hm76flv,misteryon22,11/26/2021,1,108.0,>I know he cares about his rank because when I watch him play hes almost always raging at teammates or op champs or whatever and insists that he wants to improve  And thats exactly why he cant improve. In his eyes he doesnt do anything wrong and its always his teammates or the enemy team. Until he stops blaming factors outside of his control and focuses solely on what he could have done better and nothing else he wont get anywhere near a decent rank
hm7ezx4,edgelordweeb_,11/26/2021,1,100.0,Fuck the iCarly reboot the show never needed a reboot and it never shoulda happened
hm7336l,infamousspammer,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,The thing that is really the saddest part about Adams twitlonger is the fact that he thinks that Fnatic would have performed better at worlds with Upset under these circumstances. I mean if something so bad happened in Upsets private life that he is even considering to leave his team and the chance to play at worlds he would surely not be able to properly focus on the game and perform up to his normal level.  Has there been some issue with the communication inside the team? I dont know but it seems like it. I can understand Upset not wanting to tell his teammates about some issues of people in his private life. I mean imagine his wife was suffering from heavy depressions. Would there be any reason to tell this to his teammates especially if they are just that - teammates? I for sure wouldnt and that would also be the case if it is just me having depressions. I would probably only tell my closest friends. And lets face reality just because you are on a team doesnt mean you are even friends. So there is no reason for the other guys on his team to expect anything more then some standard phrase. And if they are not satisfied with that it would be the job of Fnatics management to ensure them that there is a valid reason for Upset to leave.  That there also was some miscommunication around the thing with Alphari at least based on what the two twitlongers state surely doesnt help in calming Adam. But nonetheless it is a very bad fashion to air your dirty laundry in public...
hm720ur,StarkGilford,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Upset must be fucked in the head if he married this thot after dating her for only 2 months.

hm83796,LakersLAQ,11/26/2021,1,,Thats not the point though. They were using both last year with Jiizuke and Ignar and he makes it a possibility for future moves. His salary isnt going to go down just because EG decides not to use an import slot one year.

I get it to the end it tells my Im victorious and then I have to click continue.  However nothing ever changes on the main page.  I cant do part 2 because it doesnt recognize completion of part 1.  Google has not yielded help.  Any thoughts on what Im doing wrong?
hm7mhjb,Katsunivia,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Ive also been wondering what the heck people here are taking. Theyve known each other for such a short time. Noone knows if they are even good friends outside of the team environment and now they all think Upset should seriously tell his coworker he has known for a very short time about his wifes personal life and problems. Not to mention Adam legitimately showed he cant keep this issue to himself and that is he too immature to not accidently (or through an emotional reaction) spill the beans about the actual details if he knew.
hm7diqy,Forrest02,11/26/2021,1,525.0,He won the lawsuit but it was one of those He lost more then he gained kind of wins. It was also based on an older contract type that Twitch no longer uses as well so the whole thing means fuck all at this point lol.

hm8pitq,bburgers9,11/26/2021,1,13.0,People seem to fail to realize that a game having a lot of players doesnt mean its a good game. In leagues case its a highly addictive game. But the quality can only decay to a certain point until even those who are addicted such as myself such as a lot of league veterans have had enough and are simply forced to move on. We havent quite hit that point yet but its on the horizon. Im not surprised leagues player count has been going up. Im sure it will for some time. But give it 5 years tops. If Riot doesnt start to focus on making a good game instead of an entertaining one people are going to start to notice and that player count graph is going to pull an uno reverse.
hm82s0h,Ebobab2,11/26/2021,1,62.0,> maw of malmortious isnt a good item on go in supports (and barely on most go-in midlaners) ~ so them pinging it is just a sign that they dont believe your item is reasonable.  99% they just ping it because they want to shift the blame on you and your item choices while completely abandoning any of their contributions to their game
hm7nbgs,Skylam,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,But they dont have the right to air it all publicly and obviously incite a witchhunt...
hm7cbrm,Barfmeister,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,THANK YOU. To me it seems so obvious that this is the case. The details are not just his to divulge he is protecting the privacy of his loved ones and is prepared to take the consequences from that. In terms of communication with his teammates Im sure he could have handled it better but its also a high bar to set if you expect someone going through something traumatic to also be a perfect communicator during that time. My general takeaway from this is that Upset seems like a person with great integrity and care for those closest to him.

His idea of what good management is and what FNC should have done I guess.      Translation for those that dont speak french as he answers someone asking him what hed do if one of his players did the same as Upset (according to adam twitlonger) :      I take his passport and phone when we arrive if you want to leave you better have a good reason.

He doesnt need to share many details or specifics but thats way too fucking generic. Obviously some of his teammates were not satisfied at all with the flimsy explanation. Which could be the fault of the org and not upset himself.

hm77u8c,2poundWheel,11/26/2021,1,74.0,Kingen was a monster in 2020 summer (I believe couldve been 2021 Spring memory is hazy) and now that he actually has teammates (last year he had a terrible coach drafting him into garbage positions Pyosik who is the most up and down jungler in the league Jett(Plex) who just didnt make sense and was a plug-and-play bandaid for the team while having a rotating door of botlanes  The topside of Peanut and Doran doesnt inspire a lot of confidence.  Kiin  Rascal (If he plays even close to his level in Spring)  Zeus  Doran/Kingen/Canna  Sword/Dove  is my honest opinion. If Dove gets swapped for Howling then it gets more dangerous for Doran. My point isnt that Doran is bad its that Doran is not a super-team material player (very few are..hence super team) The phrase super team is getting beaten to death the last few years.
hm7aiwy,ceyx0001,11/26/2021,1,4455.0,Im not even sure what your point is? People CLOSE to Upset understand that playing worlds is his dream. Are they work buddies or not? Is this a job like you had in mind that you can simply just leave or not? If they are how should Adam be able to know if the only communication he got was that Upset had to leave without being communicated the severity of the situation.
hm7igiv,ApplePitou,11/26/2021,1,2.0,This option gives the enemy team an additional chance which in my opinion is good :3

hm6z75s,-LostInCloud-,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Keep in mind here in Germany (or Europe generally) we tend to do things a bit differently than you folks do in America.  A employer or even teacher would not even be legally allowed to ASK about it if theres a sick note for example.  Upset is not slave and should be treated accordingly.  >Upset didnt trust his teammates to tell them but he expects his teammates to trust him to not need the details.  Upset told multiple members of team and staff offered to tell Hylli. Given what Adam and Bwipo now did he was right not to trust them.  Either way its not like hes asking them to trust him they dont have any right to know in the first place.  Fucking Americans man what do you expect from a society that cant even give people health insurance.

Its only toxic when 1 person holds 4 in a disaster of a game and makes upset people sta and argue rather than move on.

hm7kj3s,setocsheir,11/26/2021,1,130.0,You need to acheive the next step of awareness which is knowing what you can do with that information.  So you know theres 3 bot side. That means you can take an objective topside. At its most basic. So thats like gold level knowledge.  Once you get more advanced itll be like I spotted Lee Sin bot side with idk 45 cs or something. We have vision in his jungle bot side and know he just cleared bot side with his top side camps up. Lee sin will probably try to gank mid or bot or take dragon - if those arent options he will path around top and look to clear his camps top. That means you can let your top laner know where Lee Sin will likely be or plan to take dragon with your jungler with the prio you have bot. It could also be I know lee sin will be top side so I can play more aggressively and take plates bot as a result.  You have to start applying the knowledge you do have to situations further in the future and go beyond basic ok am I going to get ganked here or not?

hm76w0u,babylovesbaby,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Its not the same situation. Day jobs and once in a life time events you pin your hopes and dreams and future career prospects on are not the same thing. Most people have to be explicit about issues which take them away from work but again day job vs. the aforementioned is hugely different. I dont think the teammates had a right to know the details but their frustration is understandable.  I just wish threads like this would stop being posted - everyone seems to understand the situation was bad and this aftermath is unnecessary.
hm7auor,Amsement,11/26/2021,1,125.0,I dont remember LS saying hes bad. He just said that Jensens play for most of the season looked like he was checked out which is something other people have said as well iirc and could be sentiment TL shared if they were willing to replace him with Bjergsen who has been out of it for a year. I havent seen any notable person in the scene say that Jensen isnt good enough but rather that the price tag for him probably isnt worth it for a lot of teams. Theyd be paying whatever the buyout is + his salary unless Jensen is willing to settle for a lower salary which is unlikely. If teams are aiming to get salaries to more reasonable points I dont really blame them for not picking up Jensen.
hm8fzv8,gkrown,11/26/2021,1,118.0,this is my biggest annoyance in low elo supports. playing behind me as adc is awful. either be in a line or be in front. but playing behind just gives all the advantage and starves me off cs. even worse when they have full mana.

hm71mqt,Reclaimer879,11/26/2021,1,74.0,I have seen the Faker vs Chovy match up enough to realize Faker brings more to his teams. Chovy is a beast in lane but that isnt the full package. I would take Showmaker over Chovy anyday and depending on the type of roster I would take Faker as well. BDD imo looked better this Worlds.
hm8dshn,castrozaka,11/26/2021,1,3.0,League of Legends the MOBA is dying and not actively drawing in new players. At least in long-term anyway. The community is fucking evil at its core the gameplay and balance are becoming shittier with each passing season the game is very difficult and overwhelmingly newcomer unfriendly. And this isnt even scratching at the surface of its problems now.  On the other hand League of Legends as a multi-media IP is going strong and will carry on. You have a plethora of engaging spinoff games a compelling cartoon and comic cinematic universe and so on. An ambitious fighting game as Riots next E-Sports IP can also create a community to eclipse the MOBA by drawing in the FGC.  It seems they planned well ahead anticipating for what might happen to the MOBA.
hm8jqtw,LazerFruit,11/26/2021,1,10.0,I dont think the issue is one of physically declining tbh the issue is one of time. What sport requires its athletes to practice 10-12 hours a day if not more to maintain top level. I think the reason pro players get worse faster in league than traditional sports is because they lose the drive to spend their entire day every day playing and practicing league. When you get older you prioritize other things some people want to spend time with family/significant others start families etc. So they spend less and less time practicing so other players improve faster while they fall behind the curve

Maybe the family member in question kept it secret on social media.  Its still very possible he lied. If we assume fnc coaching was okay with him leaving as is everyone in the scene who knows of his situation were also assuming upset lied to all of them.  Ultimately we just dont know but I would still stand on the side of charitability. If it really was all a farce and he really just went home because of his wife then when it leaks we can do the memes but before we know that id say nah lets be chariable.

hm7u07d,Adventurous-Sport-45,11/26/2021,1,19.0,I dont think Mel could *be* Rell unless they completely changed Rells appearance *and* backstory around. And while there have been some changes (Caitlyn looks a little different Ekko has a different hairstyle hextech is much newer) generally speaking most of the characters look very much like their game counterparts. And yeah they are both Black Noxians is not much to go on by itself.   However I think there is too much that hints at a possible connection or inspiration to dismiss out of hand. That is we cannot discard the possibility that the characters are related Mel took inspiration from Rell and so forth.  In general Mel is from Noxus she has a mother who is a high-ranking Noxian and who is focused on her children being strong and ruthless above all else and at any cost and her name is just one phoneme different from Rell. That would be enough to make one wonder whether the writers of *Arcane* were at least thinking of Rell when they made her character even if they had no in-story connection or Rell did not exist in *Arcane*.   But most importantly at the end of the final episode when Jinx fires her rocket at the council chamber Mels golden accoutrements start glowing. That just screams metalmancer to me (look at how Rells hair and metal glow). And (correct me if I am wrong) so far only one champion is a metalmancer *at all*. Not in Noxus but at all and thats Rell. It still seems unlikely that she *is* Rell but there sure are a few similarities between them.  Of course the flip side is that the show has apparently been in development since 2015. Rell was released in 2020 so the writers must have at least had the general idea for Mels character before Rell was released and possibly since before her character was in development. I mean Mels role is not minor: she helped jumpstart the development of hextech helped get Jayce on the council and remove Heimerdinger later entered a romantic relationship with him and is the catalyst for Ambessa (and Noxus by extension?) coming to Piltover.   So they had to have had her in there from a fairly early stage which means that if there were any connection between Mel and Rell Mel would almost certainly have had to come first.

hm8pfjw,studiousAmbrose,11/26/2021,1,165.0,Do you have anyone that you laned against that put more pressure on you than others or made you just go wow theyre a bit apart from other players?

hm6y09x,CoogiMonster,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Beyond this you get critiqued for taking time off from management and coworkers in regular jobs.  If your reasoning for needing time off isn’t sufficient even as a burger flipper plenty of people will dig you for it.  Anything that remotely complicates someone else’s life gets met with pushback and support it’s the nature of humans and thinking the world revolves around them.

hm7x3yx,Luquitaz,11/26/2021,1,,The guy clarified that he thinks support is the hardest to climb with if youre significantly better than everyone else in the game.

hm77a7k,Random_Stealth_Ward,11/26/2021,1,51.0,Guess The visuals of the passive may be tied to the spells hitting Champion rather than the spell actually affecting the Champion but that is kind of a weird situation then.  There are some cases of effects ignoring stuff like blocks because the only condition is that they hit something but its usually not just visually. For example soraka hitting Spellshielded targets with Q activates her Q passive even though the spell didnt affect them.  Maybe a similar case happens with Talon P and while the passive assumes every hit counts the condition itself remains as damage the enemy and so only the visuals appear.

hm8gz0v,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,118.0,always be ready to skill different abilities and play different styles. In early game you can very easily roam off resets and in lane gank. Mid to late be creative with your flanks or use your teammates to get snap engages.

hm7ftr0,babylovesbaby,11/26/2021,1,,Indeed I get that but you cant really justify being angry at someone for not speaking English if you dont speak *their* language. It certainly makes communication in some games harder when people have the ability to speak a common language but refuse but thats their right - they can speak whatever language they want just like you can.

hm810h8,Odd_Play_5769,11/26/2021,1,3.0,Also they cant show it before draft because it will dictate draft. Both teams will be drafting around synergy with soul point or just generally whatever buff the drake gives naturally. Its too game warping. Besides j like the RNG-lite we get with it

There’s more than just the buyout here. Teams would have to pay Jensen close to what he’s actually making from the bench for him to be interested too.

hm76bv2,RemoteAnalysis3809,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,For real people need to stop re-hashing this point and accuse Upset or Adam of lying because anyone with reading comprehension can understand that one side gave only the severity of the situation while the other wanted specificity.   They literally both talked about their stance throughout all the twitlongers.
hm7p29l,Jonoabbo,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Yes a bit of professionalism wouldnt go amiss. My teammate wouldnt share intimate details about his personal life with me and then was involved with replacing me with a better player is hardly anything personal. If he is going to start making twitlongers and going into meltdown every time either of those things happen its going to be a rough career.   He is well within his right to be upset or frustrated with the situation but he is hardly justified to be mad at anybody.

hm7jcgy,amroth6464,11/26/2021,1,,I dunno decency ?  And if you talk purely about rights im pretty sure public slander without any basis is not that much allowed.  You can probably argue he didnt specifically say that Upset was lying about his situation but it doesnt make it any less a dick move.  He knew that by his move he would send a huge band of degenerate on Upsets family especially on his wife whos active on internet.  &#x200B  And yet youre here telling yeah ? so what ? 
hm7qfb2,DoorHingesKill,11/26/2021,1,124.0,> life sucks sometimes and theres nothing you can do about it when it happens.  Id check with a lawyer and see if I could sue Upset for the occurred losses. If Fnatic had done well at Worlds Adam might have been able to negotiate a significantly better contract.
hm76ctg,horrorpastry,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Its not a problem playing casually its more an odd cultural observation. Most non-english speakers start off in english but then revert back into their own language when they need to flame but French people seem to do the opposite.

I want to build trust with colleagues in work related things. Not divulge personal things and trust them in that sense.

hm897pe,josluivivgar,11/26/2021,1,115.0,at least for TL they just showed with alphari that theyre willing to be lenient and not screw over their players I guess?  so if you do well you get $$$$$$ if you dont then you still get more than a one year contract and get to negotiate to leave to another team.  (theres also a good chance that salaries have peaked with some good players not getting chances because of high salaries so an extended contract is great for a player in a market that might be adjusting next year)  now if I was signing with G2 I would definitely not sign anything more than a 1 year contract.

hm89sm6,Arcille,11/26/2021,1,165.0,Very few people will have their ceiling be bronze. Ceiling being gold for some people is believable but I don’t think you understand how low down bronze is.  People are stuck in bronze or silver because they choose not to actively think and play. It’s very easy to just auto pilot while playing the game and I bet that’s the biggest reason people get stuck at ranks below plat  A bronze player literally just has to think about their decisions actively and they will climb

hm8mvdd,xxReadMarxxx,11/26/2021,1,102.0,I actually think a lot of people watch LPL games. Like two of them. Ill willingly admit that I watch maybe 5 non-playoff LPL games per season and thats probably more than average but not enough for these kinds of nuanced opinions.   The problem is people seeing a game or three of LPL and thinking that qualifies them to have infallible opinions about all of Chinese League because all those other redditors dont even watch LPL
hm7dxvu,Adleyy65,11/26/2021,1,,No in the end he settled for a pretty reasonably amount. Its reported to be a 600.000 buy out which seems fair and is significantly lower then what it was supposed to be at the start.
hm7izoo,Proterragon,11/26/2021,1,,OK didnt expect a serious response on reddit so I will apologize for snarkiness in my first reply seemed warranted at the time.  My point here is that teammate is just a term for someone who is in the same team as you. Thats it. There are different kinds of teams and there are as many different kinds of teammates as there are different people. I understand that some people presume that being teammates automatically means a deeper and closer connection but IMHO that Is a childish immature and naive position of someone who either hasnt had many real life experiences (especially as a member of a team) or simply has a romanticized notion of being a team. Or possibly (or even usually perhaps) both. Now they are probably not to be blamed for this. Modern media loves to portray sports teams as some kind of families or comrades in arms. But as it usually happens real world is not like that. And there is a direct correlation between being more experienced being in the industry (any industry) longer and knowing that your team members are not always your friends. In most cases actually its just business.  Whole drama here is that Adam is an immature unprofessional 18-19 year old (btw BIG NOTE HERE let that sink in hes a fucking teen with no life experience let alone knowledge of business etiquette or procedures). And being an immature teen that he is he overreacted mishandled his at least partially justified frustrations behaved unprofessionally took it personally when his team explored other options for his position and generally shat the bed with his childish behavior.  On a wider point about community this community as well is full of immature childish people who do not understand what Is professional and what isnt and to whom does Upset owe an explanation and to whom does he not.  Last thing Adam did react unprofessionally and immaturely without thought of influence he wields and the consequences that his TL will lead to. That does reflect on him badly but he is still very young this is his first 6 months in any professional environment and he has space to learn so I dont hold it against him too much. Just think that he is being a baby about it and thats it.

hm8dn17,blackrifleenthusiast,11/26/2021,1,17.0,I’ve noticed it’s been worse than normal. Runes/builds I don’t really care about it’s preseason. But people are legitimately soft inting every game or just have no clue what they are doing. It might be people playing off-role but it is markedly worse than say 2 months ago.   For example I had today a Leona who had the least damage taken in the entire game and a Malzahar who didn’t use his ultimate until 20 min in the game
hm7lb06,Cassereddit,11/26/2021,1,126.0,The rune provides you with an item every few minutes early on with which you can instakill any type of minion (no matter how many HP they have left) and you permanently gain more damage towards that type of minion for the rest of the game.   Ask r/ahrimains for more Ahri specific builds etc. if you want to

hm7fbju,not_so_pro,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,I dont understand what he has to apologise for? He and the fnatic management declared that whatever the situation was that it was extreme enough for him to go home. By the sounds of it it wasnt a spur of the moment decision it was all discussed with the relevant parties. People forget that upset has been trying for years to make worlds. It was literally adams first split. If hes as good as he thinks he is hell go again

hm7lhh6,plexerfhk,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Upset owes his teammates jack shit and management spilling the beans to his teammates would be a huge violation of Upset’s trust. He had personal family emergencies that precluded his participation in Worlds 2021 that is all the explanation FNC deserves. If the rest of FNC wants more they should fuck off. Adams a giant bitch for airing his dirty laundry online.

hm7e32h,limeopolis1,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,> When talking about Upset leaving he said that he knows it must be super important because Upset is a competitor and would not give up and leave for nothing.  lmfao did you watch the video or are you just trying to push some dogshit narrative.  Yamato word for word said he shared some details with me but I dont need to know everything.  Clearly what Upset shared with him was enough for the coaching staff to agree with the decision.
hm7bkkf,Snoo8331100,11/26/2021,1,157.0,Played on both and both are awful. On EUNE people flame more in their native tongues on EUW they usually do it in English. But both are terrible toxic cesspools.

hm75q21,jaguar317,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,I mean you might see it that way but I feel like most reasonable people would see Upsets first twitlonger as an emotional response to a massive douche move by Adam (which is why its so poorly written) and this one as clarification to the firsr one after collecting his thoughts. Like I said Adam was the one who was a giant douchebag. Do not put the blame on Upset for defending himself.

hm75yh3,kazuyaminegishi,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Upset *has* been transparent about whats happening. The transparency is the family emergency.  Bwipo Adam and Nisqy simply dont believe thats the case so they want to know exactly what the emergency is. Its like when a coworker you hate calls in sick so you now have to do double the work your first thought is I bet theyre faking sick and they just went on vacation regardless of what the truth is. For you you wont believe it until they come to work the next day and see them coughing up a lung (the you being a hypothetical person).  Adam and Co are this hypothetical coworker. Its not that Upset didnt convey that he had an emergency Its that he didnt convey what this emergency was so they could decide for themselves if it was severe enough for him to leave them high and dry.  The complications of the situation are that Upset is right to keep his private life private regardless of the effort he and his teammates put into this year he prioritizes his family over a trophy and thats his prerogative.  His teammates who are not in this situation prioritize the trophy over Upsets family problems so they are right to be angry that something that doesnt involve them killed their tournament.  The issue comes in that theyve made this frustration a public issue instead of a private one and no amount of justification can explain that. They should have put on the big boy pants told management that Upsets conduct made him unreliable and said us or him or moved on. Hes never going to tell them what happened and getting the public to bully him into doing so by spreading conspiracies about his wife is childish and vile.

hm78uxi,Conker184,11/26/2021,1,74.0,I didnt remember this game too much so I went through and quickly played through it they were even in cs for a lot of the early game and BDD made roam plays that gave his team an advantage and Humanoid farms during this period then he just gets more farm since thats what Viktor does.  The term flame horizon means less when people like you just call it out any time there is a 100 CS difference without looking at any context.

hm7z8oc,DangerousSeaweed0,11/26/2021,1,1589.0,if people really thought upset might leave  bean wouldnt have had only 2 10 minutes scrim games.  if there is even a small chance one of your players cant play  u try to integrate the substitute into scrims.  remember mikyx at msi 2019 ? g2 mostly scrimmed with promisque because miky had hand issues and the org was not certain he could play.   fnc not giving bean more then 2 scrims when that possibility was on the table means 1 of 2 things :  - fncs coaching staff is incompetent.  - fnc expected upset to play.  Assuming yamato is not a straight up idiot  that means that upset didnt made the issue as clear as he makes it be at the very least

You dont have to trust everyone until they prove you wrong i bet someone that would life his live like that is up to a lot of nasty suprises.  Trust is earned. Hyli was able to earn his share Adam and Bwipo werent.  Why should they trust he had legit reasons? They dont have to. They have to accept it and not incite angry fans to harass him and his wife.   They have the right to be angry and irretated i can empathise with that. But shit happens.

hm78l46,puhtoinen,11/26/2021,1,141.0,How is that racist? When youve played CS:GO for 4000 hours while neighboring Russia you can get back to me with your own anecdotal evidence.  I never said russians are incapable of speaking english or learning the language. I merely pointed out a fact that the vast majority of russians I encountered in the couple thousand games I played would only communicate in russian even in situations where the rest of the team were speaking english with eachother.  This is also not something only I have witnessed go ask the Dota2 community how hard it is to communicate with russians.   I also dont understand how you managed to get offended people like to be able to communicate with their teams in team games. When that doesnt happen no matter what the reason is it takes something out of the experience. I have no ill will towards the people of Russia I just cant communicate with them and that does bum me out in a game thats all about the team.
hm75xzx,InsuranceOne2864,11/26/2021,1,1001.0, Im still defending upset but you are totally right. Everything about their relationship looks weird from his wifes background (2 divorcesneeding visa for europeonly fansgold digger status) to the fact that they married so fucking soon as they got together.    Its absolutely unreal how young adult males are so easy target for manipulative women. Even worse when someone like Upset has probably 0 life experience in social interactions.   The guy married mostly based on his hormones and he does not even realize it.
hm76f1w,InsuranceOne2864,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Nah its much more.   2 divorces getting visa for europe from a south american country onlyfans/some sex cam too i think gold digger status in chile and a couple of more people saying she was a prostitute too (i have 0 proof in this regard so i wont take it into consideration).   Poor guy married after his hormones went nuts and he does not even realize it yet.

hm7pfh9,vegeful,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Its even more shitty when he got caught playing aram during Fnc match. According to some its a 10 hour long of playing league.    Like dude have some consideration and play on alt account or offline game. Its give many kind of speculation and bring mixed feeling to your team mate. It give the i gtg soon to your bff but 10 minute later u play with another friend vibes.  He truly dont give a fk about his team feeling.
hm76jb1,whydoyoureadnames,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Given the scenario and events surrounding it they were most likely given enough info that something involving his wife happened (Adam mentioning the wife bwipo and girlfriend tweets at the time etc.)  So we can infer that meaning they got info enough to know it involves the wife in someway most likely. So they got told something and that’s all they need to know honestly. If a personal emergency happens than that’s the end of discussion they aren’t entitled to know more and sure as hell shouldn’t direct fans to harass people either.  Edit: done explaining this to people who want to just be angry that an adult had an emergency and dealt with it fine

hm74j52,Gort566,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,Do you think an org can breach a players privacy for anothers feelings? He can feel entitled to know all he wants. Fnatic cannot divulge the information

hm7kamq,LakersLAQ,11/26/2021,1,63.0,Did Bwipo still have a contract with Fnatic? If not hes not really a big change. His salary would just fall somewhere around what Alphari and Impact were making. Bjergsen wasnt a buyout because he was a free agent just salary at this point.  Hans Sama was the expensive one.   Same with Inspired on EG.
hm7sg4f,CoalaRebelde,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Management got value out of Adam and Bwipo almost got from Nisqy too.  Now they just give upset a shot at redemption with the org nurture his feeling of I need to make up and then sell him too when he peaks.  If they tried selling him now he would go for very cheap and every serious org would see a red flag in why does FNC wants to get rid of one of the best adcs in the league?.

hm77drf,RemoteAnalysis3809,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Imagine your own wife having a miscarriage (most likely since the timeline matches perfectly with a first/second trimester miscarriage considering how fast they got married and how few months it was before the incident took place)/get into an accident/etc. and your coworkers/fans be telling you shes just causing trouble.  No wonder Upset kept his mouth shut.
hm7n66o,Skylam,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Or it could be that both Adam and Bwipo are being unreasonable and wanted details other than family issues.

hm7bmw6,mistood,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,I want to give you some context on Upsets mentality.        Upset meets a camgirl/onlyfans girls who lives in South America online dates her for 2 months and decides to marry her. This is her 3rd marriage and she even has hundreds of nudes available online. You can tell from her social media that she has many red flags.        Upset makes the judgement to commit to this kind of woman marrying her after only 2 months of dating. You think he is someone who makes smart and sensible decisions? Lets just say he is prone to making stupid decisions at times. I hate how he keeps saying that the reason is due to family suffering as if his mom/dad is dying but its really he has some issues with his manipulative psychotic wife.        The fact that he chose to leave 12 hours before the first game suddenly makes me believe that the camgirl wife gave some sort of ultimatum. I do believe there is some truth in Adams statement of her feeling lonely. From her bio you can tell after they married she moved to Germany away from her home in South America. She is probably not adjusting well with no friends and family except Upset. The ultimatum was probably something like  I want to go back home to South America if you dont come back then I will leave. If his wife was truly sick it doesnt make sense that he would sudenly leave 12 hours before the game. The timing doesnt make sense. He knew he had to choose his wife or league and he chose league. The real reason would give him so much criticism that I believe he chose to put it under the guise of muh privacy. If he had a real reason people would understand support and respect his decision to leave.

hm74v14,Burning87,11/26/2021,1,108.0,Habit and stagnation can become far more of an enemy than even trollers feeders and smurfs ever could be. You see this absolutely all over the place. I am not embarrassed to admit I would easily fit into this myself as well. I reached Platinum within my third year of playing  (which is technically also a slow burn I think most would make it in their second year if they played to grow.. if not first) and I have been there since. The only excuse I have is that I genuinely feel my champions have never been granted the honor of ever being meta but they have never been NOT meta either. Just somewhere in between. There have been plenty examples of people making it where I have not.      I have a minor excuse of quitting the game somewhat in season 7 8 and partly through season 9. But I think I should have managed Diamond by now. My own experience is simply that unless you accept that you have flaws and that your choices might not be the correct ones you will never grow and get out of your bubble. Especially so if youre stuck in even lower tiers than Silver. It can be a hellish landscape unless you push your skill higher. You cannot rely on your team in such places which means you have to be the win factor every time.
hm7c7re,pinkspott,11/26/2021,1,7.0,Some abilities do seem standardized though. Projectile-type abilities that come out as a champion dies always seem to do damage (e.g. Veigar Q or Bard Q).

Most streamers that Im aware of from bigger ones like Tyler1 and Faker to medium and lesser-known streamers like Nemesis Dzukill Foxdrop SRO etc have expressed some pretty serious dissatisfaction with the current state of the game. That dissatisfaction reaches a lot of computer screens. The larger streamers cant really quit because its their livelihoods but they would if they could. Many smaller streamers have.
hm81eym,MasheeXD,11/26/2021,1,15.0,Except if 4/5 players want out of the game at 15 minutes do you seriously think there’s a chance to win …?
hm7uity,RedditChad420,11/26/2021,1,1.0,This definitely appears to be traced.

hm84zkm,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,92.0,My ADC on my collegiate team is from EUW and I think he could vouch to say Im better than Diamond EUW players. But again I dont think that matters. The people who comment think I can help them and if someone in Diamond EUW asks me for help then all to them I can answer their questions. If they think theyre better than NA challenger then so be it.
hm8077f,cygodx,11/26/2021,1,88.0,JDG wink honestly best offseason move
hm7m9z9,aglimmerof,11/26/2021,1,540.0,Akalis shroud was supposed to give true invisibility protecting her from even turret aggro.  Thankfully it didnt make it into the game ...
hm78xqn,Melodias07,11/26/2021,1,74.0,Look at replies of my other comment literally just following narrative. Even CL said that Faker had really solid form in QF and chovy said that Faker made 0 mistakes in lane so he couldnt do anything (paraphrased) but here people are living in there delusion.  chovy was below average in early summer and at the end was just just okay. In playoffs it was more about Deft/Vsta diffing every botlane they met but yeah DeFt WaShEd and its always has been ChoVy LiFeEsPoRt.

hm80ynn,RektByDefault,11/26/2021,1,11.0,Sometimes I type fullmute all and then oops forgot the slash in the chat. It usually stops the flame but then I can still hear them if they actually say something smart.
hm76u0o,CoCratzY,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Yeah I thought the same when I saw the video. It Seems like no one knows even Dardo or Yamato and now they have to lie to protect Upset argumentation
hm78t7j,Caenen_,11/26/2021,1,2.0,Its specific to how the spell is implemented unfortunately. Generally anything that uses a cast time or channel and does its effects after it does not do its effects if you die during the cast time. This is why Xerath W works this way even though spells that feel very similar do.   Xerath Q on the other hand creates the line with the area checks immediately when you recast then the effect triggers after a brief delay. Whether thats a bug is up to Riot tom decide but as per usual its thats how it works presently for the most part.  Obviously missiles that are already spawned (e.g. Xerath E after his cast time completed) persist even if their caster dies. Most of them at least.  Heres a fun note since you mentioned Sivir Q though: Early Boomerang spells didnt properly work when their caster died because casting the return missile would run into some issue (I dont remember atm if it was that it couldnt cast at a dead target or a dead character couldnt cast them) so instead of fixing that innate spell behaviour on those spells they just made a separate spell for the return missile for Sivir Q and Ahri Q and I dont remember if anyone else. Either way this is the reason Ahri Q has had her Q go invisible on the return when she died after VFX updates at least twice lmao.
hm8okzm,sephrinx,11/26/2021,1,165.0,Did you ever employ the use of the /muteall strategy?
hm77c7f,jaguar317,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Im confused by why you are equating Upset and Adams statements. Adam was very clearly on the offensive while Upset has been defending himself. Yes one is a douchebag because he directed massive amounts of hate from people like you towards Upset. The other is being bombarded by hate comments everywhere and is trying to defend himself. Yeah I feel like these two things are very different.
hm7ci94,seink,11/26/2021,1,69.0,> Lets say Riot decided to change Yasuo/Yones Ronin like outfit into something from a Chinese dynasty in major Riot label. Wouldnt fucking make sense right?   So what if it doesnt make sense? I have never thought any more or less about Yasuo and japan because its all fictional.   >Also imagine Wukong with a Samurai armor instead of a Chinese like garb from the journey to the West. Chinese people will 100% have problems with this.  I am chinese and I dont give a shit about whether wukong is not chinese enough because I have better things to do.    >  Hell some Europeans got mad that Caitlyn was turned half-Asian in Arcane when she is supposed to be a Caucasian- British aristocrat. Let me reiterate that I know its fucking fictional and a game but these things matter to some not all people.  Yeah you and those people with caitlyn mentality are ridiculous. If you dont like dont play the game. Nobody is forcing you down the throat or making assumptions about korea because of ahri.  > Ahri was created when the Korean server came out with a distinct Korean cultural semblance and even a Korean name. It is representative of Korean culture even though you might not think that way.  Yeah and I know that. And anyone with half a brain knows that she is not representative of what korean culture really is because its a fictional character in a game.   > if mad dont play the game hurdurr are you 12 who cant manage any discussion/discourse?  Well let see. If a imaginary character triggers someones cultural sensitivity and they feel the need to spend time to whine about it on the internet then yes they should uninstall and do something else.  Ahri being more or less correctly portrait in korean culture has nothing to do with korean or implies anything about them because she not real. If you cant accept that then the ONLY sensible discourse is to stop looking at it.

Ive seen numerous languages used in games and they always used English no matter how bad to communicate the plays or answer. Only French and Polish players absolutely refuse to use English and I doubt so many of them dont speak it.   Even Russians in CSGO who just blurt Russian in pubs will answer something in English even if its just to tell you Fuck you

hm765rj,Thomean,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,They have the right to be angry but they do not have the right to know the exact situation. That is something for Upset and his family to decide.   There is also a very big difference between saying the way worlds went sucked which made you angry and saying he just went home because his gf was lonely.   Him not telling them is not disrespectfull at all. And as far as my experience goes in pro sports (development teams in my youth) it was not the norm to share personal information during family problems.   Hell I would not even expect my own family to share everything about a problem if they did not want to talk about it. They will tell me enough and I trust them. And comming back to sports if the manager/coach said it was an emergency then it was an emergency.   This just sounds like Adam not trusting anyone at fnatic
hm78e2f,dmtoddle,11/26/2021,1,1190.0,Yeah Im js this bc hes still listed as looking for a team on this sheet
hm79qw2,Btigeriz,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,100% Adam and anybody else on the team are allowed to be upset but Adam knew what was going to happen when he publicly said Upsets reason wasnt legitimate and had to do with his wife (he was likely completely wrong) and that is why Adam should get criticized by the community. Even if he just wanted to call Upset out fine whatever but leave Upsets family out of it.

hm89fe9,MapPotential9009,11/26/2021,1,65.0,League isnt about having fun anymore its about winning at all costs even in non-ranked/urf/ultimate spellbook games. It used to be a slower paced game with less power spikes and more winnable comebacks but todays League is a different beast. A single kill or item can put certain characters so far ahead of their opponent that it becomes almost impossible to comeback. Games now snowball so hard 50% of the time League is really unfun to play. The community has also become far less forgiving and patient to mistakes and the blame is always shifted to another player even though the mistake was their fault. Toxicity is a real problem at the moment and it goes unchecked and unpunished which really sucks for veteran and new players. Riot have failed to address it.

hm7f4wh,Jiffyyy,11/26/2021,1,74.0,it sucks for everyone there you think Upset was excited to go home and miss out playing at worlds? life sucks sometimes and theres nothing you can do about it when it happens.  but you really need to drop this notion that people are entitled to his personal life. work and personal life are separate and remain that way unless the person decides to share with others things about their personal life. a lot of people seem to have a lack of respect to peoples boundaries and personal life and feel entitled to know everything.
hm7i7lm,mewfour,11/26/2021,1,528.0,yes and no - his E was a global range teleport but did not give vision. You could teleport anywhere but you were blind until you arrived.  his R gave vision on everyone and slowed them by 40% while it was active

hm8lfv1,Eaglekingoftheskies,11/26/2021,1,12350.0,> What other weapons have we seen enforcers use throughout the series? Its literally just rifles and at best case gas grenades. Of the two people with hextech one is also missing. >  >   The weridest thing about this argument is that you assume they arent going to make more hextech weapons when they litearlly talk about arming enforcers with hextech. You keep saying some nonsense like silco will just attack before that happens when he doesnt have any power at all to do so.   >Yeah and those that actually did this are a minority. Most people dont want to risk dying.   You really dont understand much about history   >Youre the one who said they were calling for their precious earlier lmao they crawl on all fours and go precious when silco pulls out a vial. They literally all golum.    I never said any of that. You kept acting like they were compeltely and totaly useless. Its a stupid argument now and its stupid everytime youve mentioned it  >Ah yes me thinking the drug trade is about money is wrong lmao   Not the money thing. You thinking the drug trade is all about funding the revoluton is wrong and you still have yet to address the fact that silco just commited straight up murder. The closest was you saying people die in war which had nothing to do with silco murering people.   >Ok hold on how was Vander fixing zaun exactly? He cut a deal with the enforcers to try and maintain the status quo. He wasnt actually improving anything.   Where on earth did you get the idea vander was trying to maintain the status quo from? That is literally never even implied. You have some sort of werid selective memory because several points youve made this entire conversation is just you literally misremembering a scene.   >How can you possibly think that bribing enforcers doesnt help his goal of a revolution?  Because he forced the enforcers to brutally murder people on the streets. Seriously rewatch the series. Theyve mentioned tthis several times. It had nothing to do with them trying to stop them. It was never about controlling an enemy force. It was always about installing fear in the population of zaun so that theyd never rebel against him. One of the main reasons why he tried so hard to get rid of the firelights is because they did actually stand up to silco.  Whats werid about you aside form you misremembering scenes is that the show is pretty clear on the narrative about this. Its not my intperation. Silco was manipulating athority and doing whatever it took to stay in power why ekko and his groups were vigilantes who tried to stand up to him. You just keep trying to whitewash everything silco does and try to link it all to a revolution that never happened.   >The deal he cut with jayce is literally him stating it.   No he didnt. Because like I said earlier you completely misremmebered the scene. Silco never intimitaded jayce into do anything and there is no indication that he was ever using the drug trade to fund research. In fact his actual factory where he made the stuff is run mostly by children. Jayce cut a deal with silco out of sympathy and nothing more. Jayce said that silco would get crushed if they went against piltover and wanted to avoid more bloodshed. He also said that Piltover has ignored most of zauns problems so is unworthy to be in charge of the place. Those are the two reasons why Jayce cut a deal. It had litearlly nothing to do with anything silco did   >No the issue is that you seem to think that revolutionaries/revolutions/civil war leaders are hollier than jesus figures that are completely infallible and 100% pure of heart that never did anything bad.   I literally never said or implied any of the sort. But silco never started a revolution. You can say he tried to plan one sure but not everything the character did was related to that goal. You seem to think that silco murdering children somehow helped him with a revoliution. And then you kept trying to make a bunch of straw men arguments like when you brought up death tol  Like I said in another comments the amount of civilians involved the death toll  the cause the date none of that stuff is relevant or similar to anything silco did. Because silco never started a revoluton. Silco was a drug kingpin who commited murder in order to stay in power and bribed the cops to take out rivals and those who stood up to him

hm7guaw,hanameister,11/26/2021,1,75.0,1. Your trinket should always be blue or yellow (most eves players prefer blue) because if you sweep with oracle the enemy can see that the vision is temporarily gone 2. predator seems like a gimmick (you might hit w easier but youre letting them know that youre there with predator giving counterplay) best way to hit charm is be behind them cast charm and let them walk into you or quick w q and burst if you know you can kill 3. your cs per min indicates youre not keeping up in cs the enemy jungler (6-7 cs per min is ideal) 4. your itemization doesnt look ideal besides having mejai and protobelt but you die way too much (6 is way too high for an eve player to keep the stacks) try: dark seal/mejais into protobelt/boots and after is situational deathcap if youre snowballing or ahead into banshees/lich bane as last items. Zhonya is not good on eve. Void staff can be bought imo but some dont like it because eve has great magic pen with W and general burst.

hm7u1tp,evan1932,11/26/2021,1,124.0,This sub is a joke. 80% of the posts are esports related when a whole sub dedicated to lol esports exists. And a lot of these posts are just updates on drama between players/organizations. I get that this is a general subreddit for lol and lol-related stuff but the amount of attention and arguments around this stupid and pointless drama is insane to me and not a good look for the sub especially to newcomers and new players.

hm7b2rq,damselindis,11/26/2021,1,523.0,**Shurimas Legacy**    * Removed: Will of the Emperor (Attack speed gain from cooldown reduction)  **Conquering Sands**   * Removed: Additional damage per soldier. The slow is still reapplied.  **Arise!**   *   New Effect: Soldier attacks now draw minion aggro to Azir.    *  Soldier command range reduced to 660 from 800.    *   Removed: Soldiers being able to attack wards or trinkets.    *   Soldier vision range reduced to 350 from 575.    *   Removed: Casting on top of turrets to damage them.    *   Removed: Sand Soldiers applying  Fervor of Battle    * Removed: Soldiers being able to attack wards or trinkets.  **Shifting Sands**  * Range reduced to 1100 from global.   * No longer knocks up the first champion hit.  **Emperors Divide**  *    Removed: The wall no longer knocks back any enemy who attempts to pass through once stationary although still functions as impassable terrain. *    Wall duration reduced to 3 seconds from 5 / 6 / 7. *   Removed: Bonus movement speed to allies or Azir on pass-through.  The champ has been through some shit lol. These are just the big changes too not including the numerous (yet minor) Q cd nerfs W attack speed and soldier pass-through damage nerfs etc. Also hes gotten some positive changes in the form of triple soldiers granting attack speed and E giving a soldier charge on collision.
hm8hkur,StarGaurdianBard,11/26/2021,1,31.0,No way will any of the teams do that. Imagine KeePass saying no LCK teams this year only CL teams are allowed and some teams still entered their LCK teams anyways. They would be the laughingstock of Korea and fans would be pissed about that team interrupting a tournament for rising talent instead.  I can only assume you only think this because you werent aware that the rules changed this year:  https://www.invenglobal.com/articles/15814/kespa-cup-2021-ulsan-to-be-held-from-dec-10-to-12-all-lck-teams-will-not-be-playing-for-the-first-time-in-tournament-history

hm7t7cl,LakersLAQ,11/26/2021,1,161.0,What is his buyout at? No one with credible information has said that this is the case lol.  All the top teams had different plans and Jensen is not going to cut his salary just so he can play on a worse roster. It would be smart for him to just take a break and collect his salary for at least a split or the year then he can make a choice after. Crazy to think that Steve is holding Jensen in contract jail just so TL can keep paying his salary.
hm801rw,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,55.0,Champion pool definitely has a HUGE part in climbing. Sitting on a small pool will help you climb much faster. Having versatility in champion playstyle is essential when it comes to learning role + climbing. Ex. Playing ADC my champ pool would be something like  Hyper carry Utility Duelist (Jinx Jhin Kalista). At first I would play on rovex3 and just play kayn for fun. I wasted a LOT of time on that but it was fun  l o0 o l. Next season for sure I will take the climb very seriously and treat every account as my main so I can climb higher.

The same way it was explained that Hyli didnt want to know any details because what he already knew was enough to understand how important it was.

hm6y8f5,PassageForsaken8736,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Tell me you don’t understand how competitive league is not the same as soloq without telling me:   There’s a reason concepts like weakside/strongside feeding resources etc exist in competitive sports and it’s very difficult to play with a different team composition where you have no chemistry all of a sudden. Not commenting at all on Adam/Upset but Nisqy played very well when he was able to and this is not on him at all.
hm74737,00Dandy,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,Well Upset is better than Rekkles atm so Fnatic couldve tried to trade him. Besides that there were plenty of other good ADCs available this offseason like Hans Sama Carzzy Patrik and several others. Or they could have promoted Bean to the main roster.

hm7x752,amroth6464,11/26/2021,1,,Anyone in their position would be frustrated and feel like they want to know. Especially young guys like them.  Do that mean they deserve to know private things about people they dont know to release their frustration ? I dont think so.  Even worse it would lead to leak those private informations to thousands of people. You keep thinking about Upset. Think about his wife or whoever is involved in that situation. Is it fair for her that thousands of people with definitely a part of malicious ones know about her miscarriage / suicide / cancer / whatever happened to her ?  &#x200B  Its not Adam Nisqy or Bwipos call to allow that to be leaked. Hell its not even Upsets call. Its hers. And no way she would accept that.  &#x200B  As much frustrated they are by not knowing why their world turned to shit its not an information they should know.  And that attempt to turn the blame on Upsets wife is a real asshole move whatever how young Adam is. And i really hope he gets some kind of retribution for actively trying to send people to harass a woman who were probably already living a frickin nightmare.

hm7knbj,00petar00,11/26/2021,1,130.0,He probably isnt trying to improve i was like him when i started playing and for the first 2 years i only played normal games and i didnt even play that often.  Many people are saying that the problem is that he is raging and blaming other people thats not really the case why do you think challanger streamers can do that every single game and still be challanger it comes to the mentality and if you can accept that you too make mistakes you can blame your team in your head for some plays but theres really not much value in typing it unless you want to lose.  It mostly came down to me playing on autopilot and just locking in the champion i want to play doing the same thing every game once you realize that you are doing that you can start to improve.  Willingness to improve not just spam games thinking you will get better that just loops you into auto-pilot gameplay ive been talking about. Always think about your decisions watch replays and figure out what you did wrong in a game and not just repeating the same mistakes.  Playing one champion or one tricking will be very helpful thats how i reached diamond for the first time once you play one champion enough that you can tell what any other champion in the game can do to you (how much damage/how much utility they provide) and knowing how much you can take damage and who you can survive and kill every single time. Thats why it is important to play one champion or a few at most when you are playing seriously you learn the limits of your champion.  If you are a laner you should learn to cs without focusing too much on last hitting so you can focus on map and enemy champion/jungler pathing/warding.  I can go on and on about specific skills and knowledge that is important like map awareness last hitting minions jungle pathing for your and enemy jungler but overall you can figure this by yourself or look it up on youtube what mostly matters is mentality of the player that wants to improve there are people with millions of points on a champion stuck in bronze and most of them arent trying to improve not everyone can though but most people can reach gold/plat and even diamond even without any great mechanical play and reaction time required by just using your knowledge.
hm85dp7,Lemon_Shooter,11/26/2021,1,4.0,The 2 outer turret trade for 5v2 bot was extremely suspect
hm7zokw,Excalidorito,11/26/2021,1,277.0,I’m all for it. I have plenty of friends on EUNE that I’d love to play with more but can’t because I’m EUW and they’re EUNE. Makes it really painful.
hm7yryi,could_eat,11/26/2021,1,13.0,What makes an adc strong in lane? It can be that they have a long auto range strong poke strong all in strong trades CC etc.  You typically pick a support that can enhance their strengths or in some cases make up for their weakness. For example: engage supports with all in adcs enchanter supports with dps champions like kogmaw poke adc and support.  So long as you stick to a reasonably small champ pool you will learn through experience. There arent that many adc champions so youll learn pretty quickly how they play.

hm7xlme,byeolToT,11/26/2021,1,156.0,Your friend probably dosnt care and dosnt want to improve but wants to just be good at the game but that only works for a small amount of players. Most of us normal people have to put in a lot of time in improving and getting small edges above the people on out elo. Also mindset says a lot and i think if someone is Stuck in Bronze but plays that amount of games they probably think they know everything but they dont know anything at All. Its also kinda important to Focus on one role and a small amount of Champions (2-3).
hm7jwpm,TargonBoi,11/26/2021,1,205.0,Are you aware that merging servers would also merge the infrastructure? Meaning that EUW would benefit from games hoster in Germany and to the east of it on the former EUNE while still being EUW?
hm7xwje,JevonP,11/26/2021,1,,no some people just dont understand how to apply perfect practice perfectly over time  everyone has the capacity to improve. Its all a mental thing you arent born good or bad at anything besides very small outliers who have mechanical or mental advantages.  The vast majority of players in any game/sport can improve. You arent just consigned to being shit
hm7uov4,SamsungBaker,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,You still dont get the point probably lack of education.   Yes Alphari is better than Adam but its not a REASON to backstab your teammate like this even more when you didnt even play at Worlds and literally made your team mental boom.   Like Upset move made all of FNC played poor at Worlds and so he decide to replace them because they played poorly + all behind their back you cant be more trashy than this
hm7dfw0,Dangnoob,11/26/2021,1,72.0,I also used Eve to hit plat this past season. And Im a jinx main at heart LOL. She can just snowball so hard and control the game. Good job man.
hm7pl75,SamsungBaker,11/26/2021,1,,Arent good?   Nisqy literally hard carried FNC during playoff as for Adam he was one of the best toplaner in LEC.   They had poor performance because all of FNC went mental boom because of Upset leave and obviously the one who didnt play worlds want to replace both of them wow
hm8kfjx,Rodniconii,11/26/2021,1,4.0,If you want a real ruined King story just play the game. Its so much better.

hm76i18,Odd_Play_5769,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,So upset posted a childish twitlonger in response to Adams childish Twitlonger realized it was childish after and then got FNATCs PR firm to writehim a better one (if you have any experience working with PR at a large corporation you know PR formatting and font the second you see it). Do I have all that right? Yeah Adam was the douchebag thoughnot Upset even though Upset did the same thing but Upset has the moral highground because he can hide behind family emergency and privacy in a highly public profession.. am I understanding all this correctly?? This is unironically your stance?

He cares about sheltering his fragile self-image much more than he cares about winning.   About 40% of league players are this way. Another 40% just treat it as any other game as a means of entertainment rather than a self-defining pursuit of mastery. The last 20% actually want to win and get skill capped between diamond and challenger.   Yes anyone who is not at least diamond is in the 80% and quite a few diamond players themselves are there too.

hm7twsk,xkap,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Respect works both way you know? How do you expect them to respect Upset when he without adequate explanation single handedly destroyed everything they worked entire year for? And on top of that Upset tried to replace his teammates behind their backs because they lack ambitions lol.
hm7s3ie,NeoDestinyy,11/26/2021,1,124.0,Was this the 5.5 fucking k guy?
hm7fzvx,brdlee,11/26/2021,1,144.0,Honestly if Jensen is as bad as LS says he is he’s legit just the clutchest person on the planet.
hm6y2c5,A001113,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Because he thinks it’s Upset’s fault. That doesn’t mean he’s right.
hm71luw,misteryon22,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Youd think the emergency part of family emergency would show that its serious but no we need to spill the tea i guess
hm7xd9a,Ray_ADC,11/26/2021,1,,No its not support as a whole is literally easier than mid for example.   So obviously getting to X rank with support would be easier since the  relative skill that you need is lower.  As for what this guy is saying the guy with the highest WR on that soloq challenge earlier this year was a support player so Id say hes just bad.
hm6yhzp,DogAteMyCPU,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Ok dude you tell Upset to postpone his family emergency 2 weeks.
hm70ztk,Omnilatent,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,I dont think you read the comment before you properly.  &#x200B  The point was his team deserves to know something specific and not something half-assed like too private to share gl in tournament
hm83e3r,Hnus22,11/26/2021,1,5.0,Its live on steam already. Not with Licensed names of players and teams still early release - but fun
hm7q1yy,yonangks,11/26/2021,1,120.0,Probably the one where her R insta cancels for no reason after using your rotation too quickly.   She also has one that insta cancels her R when used after being hit by Sylas E Kassadin Q etc. Kassadins Q should act like a channel cancel but not in Katarinas case it completely silences her from using R for like 1-2 seconds after being hit with it.
hm70j9g,Twoja_Morda,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,What exactly do you think fnc management could have done? You cant really avoid having immature players react this way if they choose to do so.
hm8rlop,Pure_Void,11/26/2021,1,102.0,yea all of the skins legit looks amazing definitely the best world skins its gonna be hard to top them. I have LeBlanc and camille ive gotten rakan shard like 3 times but i dont play supp but i want the rest though
hm7bdfx,Agrouba,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,tbf that kind of people dont even speak french..
hm6zzj9,Dreadedvegas,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Normal work doesn’t equate to professional sports and isn’t a good analogy.   If you work towards getting to a tournament the entire year get to the tournament and something happens where a teammate who is critical to how you win leaves and you’re told bare minimal information to why he left? The teammates have a right to be angry and publicly be angry.  I’m not stating the public should know I’m saying his teammates should know. Him not telling them is equally disrespectful of their situation as Adam publicly airing his “suspicion” on why he left
hm7agee,Risicoco,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,>deserve some sort of explanation  They got told it was a family emergency. Thats really all they need to know. No one has the right to know details.   And Adams twitlonger and the reaction of the French community just proves that it was right to not tell them details. You just have to look at DL to see what happens when hatemobs learn about a family tragedy.

Steps:  - Get Oracle Lens  - Obtain eye of the herald  - Summon it anywhere  - immediately use oracle lens after rift herald channel  - done
hm84a4c,NoFlayNoPlay,11/26/2021,1,126.0,playing tahm kench taught me that i can literally not lose a 1v1 even if i miss everything and go under the enemy tower.
hm717z1,Dry-Place-2986,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Not gonna lie I am guilty of this because sometimes I cant get on Discord with my friends so we just speak French in chat but I never imagined it could bother other people. I figured they could just ignore it or mute us. Its not like were expecting them to understand what were saying anyway. Thanks for letting me know its annoying lol Ill stop.
hm72in9,TheFlanderer,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Nah it was about it being fucked up not to tell your teammates what was going on. Youre trying to twist it

And yes if me and a few other coworkers worked on a project/presentation for months and one of them publicly bailed 12 hours before we present at a conference I would 100% want to know why they bailed and I would expect the same attitudes towards me if I did the same.

hm71uu9,Agreeable_Junket_271,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,I challenge anyone to think of a possible understandable reason for Upsets departure (I am hoping to be proven wrong) that satisfies:  1) Required Upset to immediately relocate in the middle of a career defining moment  2) Is so privacy-sensitive that the best explanation you can give to your teammates is that its a family emergency without being able  a single additional piece of context even a month after.  2.5) Not a medical emergency. (subsumed by point 2)

hm8ktwf,Amsement,11/26/2021,1,187.0,Hes hit Masters in Korea so idk where you get this gold player stuff from.   Hes criticized Jensens proview yes but he criticizes anything he thinks is bad play and compliments good play when he sees it. Its not as if LS has it out for Jensen or something.  [His criticisms of Jensen have primarily been in laning.](https://youtu.be/py9uQ5zYf0I?t=718)  But this is also his criticism of most western mid laners when he compared them to eastern ones at worlds.   LS gave his thoughts on Jensen not playing [here](https://youtu.be/r6XahZDXoYA?t=2524) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4e3cgTIoD0&ab_channel=LeagueofLoL).  I would say that its pretty clear his stance is that its not worthwhile paying the large sum teams would have to pay to get him when there are other options that do not cost as much. That doesnt mean Jensen is bad or that he thinks Jensen is bad. I dont know what his thoughts on Jensen are from previous years but I would say that this is a fair statement to make based off of how Jensen performed this year overall.
hm716x5,Tittymotorboat,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,A funny as fuck joke I agree
hm7i8uu,InflationSuccessful8,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,If you play as five as this level of intensity more details should be provided to avoid this kind of frustration. Either it is Fnatics fault or Upsets one but definitely not Adams who was just kept in the dark
hm7pqdg,jaguar317,11/26/2021,1,,Confused why you think Ive tried to deny you your opinion. Nowhere have I said you are not allowed to  believe what you believe. All Ive said is I disagree with it. Does it really take 5 comments for you to understand that we are on two separate sides of a debate and I am simply giving you my opinion on the situation? Im glad weve finally come to this conclusion.
hm7nqvu,Karpeeezy,11/26/2021,1,89.0,Imagine thinking the USD isnt the worlds reserve currency lmao
hm8b0ak,zoewarner,11/26/2021,1,166.0,No.  Start another thread and dont try to hijack this one.
hm7glza,Lahwtiste,11/26/2021,1,1301.0,Thats the thing people usually dont understand or chose to ignore.  People can have different definitions or opinions of the same thing.   Maybe what Upset shared in those meetings wasnt enough for the other players to relate to it or for them its not a good enough reason or something else. We cant know for sure but what one of them say wont necessarily dismiss what the other say.  And as I said in another message and you also touched about in your last sentence is the what could happen.  I might be totally wrong but from all the infos that got told it seems that the team knew he had personal issues but they werent aware that him leaving was a possibility. If they had known that they might have requested Bean to get more scrim time to prepare for that. In the end that possibility apparently became the only option since Upset said that it got worse and had to leave.  Management didnt do a good enough job in the end but its somewhat a tough situation to be in for all party involved. That also could explain why Bwipo unfollowed FNC staff on twitter because he was pissed he wasnt aware of all possibilities.
hm7jwlj,PsychoPass1,11/26/2021,1,63.0,Expensive buyouts -> Teams seem to always want to at least secure the player for a decently long time rather than paying the buyout and having them leave after one year (for free). At least C9 / TL can cash out on them if they want to leave again (of course that is only as long as teams are willing to pay such huge buyouts).
hm8fs5f,rabbitacolypse,11/26/2021,1,3.0,Honestly it either sounds like you need a better PC or to contact Riot support and send logs over for them to investigate.
hm7ehqg,Migraine-,11/26/2021,1,56.0,Yes Im currently a doctor. If I said I have to leave I have a family emergency I would be allowed (actually encouraged) to leave no further questions asked.  If someone said to me I have to leave I have a family emergency I would also encourage them to go no questions asked.
hm7g98z,akutasame94,11/26/2021,1,184.0,I transferred from EUNE to EUW was gold 1 on EUNE currently sitting in Silver 1 on EUW and wondering if I even wanna play further. The amount of games I lost due to toxicity or people running it down on EUW dwarfs those on EUNE with bonus points now I get flamed in languages I can understand (some more some less).  And no offense Frenchies but Id rather have Polish toxic players than French. French just go mdr as they die 15th time to turret Polish at least give up when they are ignored after few int deaths and sometimes try to win... Yet to see that with French inters (I mean some could have been of other nationalities but the ones that talked spoke in French)

hm7swxy,goliathfasa,11/26/2021,1,253.0,Yeah I see what you mean and where you come from.  Especially if you feel in love with the in game versions of the champs and now comparing them with their Arcane versions they’re quite different even though they’re supposed to be canon.  Honestly I just end up treating the Arcane Jinx and the game Jinx as different characters. Unless in season 2 they manage to further her transformation and tie it neatly to her in game self I have a pretty easy time to just see them as separate versions of the same character.  Kind of like comics Peter Parker and MCU Peter Parker if you know what I mean.
hm7us9y,IAmDaleicious,11/26/2021,1,52.0,Longevity. Huge champion pool. Similar but maybe slightly lower peak than TheShy. Even though Ssumday was good Smeb was clearly the best top in KR from 15-17 and again top three in 18.  Btw adding CuVee just detracts from your argument.
hm84gf6,SwagDrQueefChief,11/26/2021,1,159.0,Using an ability during rake/noxian diplomacy should cancel the movement buffer or attack buffer as the game will only store 1 input.

hm7dqzh,Sycherthrou,11/26/2021,1,64.0,I dont actually play adc. But [u.gg](https://u.gg) says twitch is now higher winrate with lethal than his previous patch highest winrate pta. And draven winrate is 4% higher with lethal than with conqueror.  The game hasnt really changed much for adcs outside of the addition of lethal so I am attributing all changes in winrate to the rune.

hm71ihn,aithosrds,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,I’m not saying he needs to tell people about his family and if that’s what you think then you’re an idiot.  I’m saying that refusing to tell his teammates giving zero information to the community is toxic and will only have a negative effect and create drama.  He could have said “someone in my family is gravely ill and I need to be there” without giving any more information and that would have been completely accepted.  Not only that but instead of creating confusion and hate the community would largely have gotten behind him and sent him well wishes and support.  I’m not saying he should have spilled his heart out and given specifics on the situation but he should have said *something* besides a “very personal family issue”.
hm7p2r9,dragunityag,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,From an American perspective that would still be pretty easy to find out? Least here everything gets reported on.

One glance at the stats would tell you that predator (and Zhonyas) on Eve is horrendous.   Its like trying to type as fast as possible with 2 fingers instead of 10. If youre used to using only 2 fingers you can still get quite fast but in the long run its worth taking the time to switch to 10.

hm7wt1v,Salvage570,11/26/2021,1,,Damn coming out swinging for no reason. Real reddit moment. They went directly out of highschool into living with a group of other people in the exact same situation and spend 10 hours a day playing LoL. It takes dedication and skill to do that but I doubt its allowed them to mature emotionally at the normal rate. The fact Adam went and took the beef public while KNOWING this was an extremely personal and emotional matter for upset kinda proves that.
hm7qlzy,Jokinzazpi,11/26/2021,1,89.0,Maybe it is time for the US to be responsible and not print 40% of all the USD in existence in a single year then.
hm856g5,TH3RM4L33,11/26/2021,1,159.0,I noticed that pressing W - Basic - R or W - R - Basic buffers both the basic attack and the ultimate after W. So its not always like that.

If you tried to play ranked and got higher than plat you were likely to get thrown against challenger players because there was no one in your MMR range. More than enough players is a pretty bold claim
hm7d7a6,hixagit,11/26/2021,1,,The same org who almost had no toplaner because all the tops they wanted refused the offers and only got one in the end because Ocelote finally lowered his buy-out for them.
hm7o4yl,bsxjiggawhat,11/26/2021,1,24.0,I like Singed
hm75f5a,matteosagwa,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,That is totally normal Alphari is better than Adam. Alphari came to Upset and asked about joining fnatic as Upset has played with Alphari before and they are friends.   Roster changes happen all the time hell Jankos wanted Rekkles out of G2 nothing wrong with that. And Upset didnt want Adam out of fnatic he just thought Alphari was a better choice for the team...because he is.
hm7yx9a,YassinRs,11/26/2021,1,105.0,So youre aware redditors wont have behind the scenes knowledge but you still ask them for their opinion and then complain that they never had the insider info?  God youre so smart
hm7kgpq,Gimmedatpls-,11/26/2021,1,114.0,Nocturne teaches you to abuse mapawareness and vision control to pick off vulnerable enemies. He makes you think about vision from both teams point of view and not just only yours (like a lot of tanks) or only the enemies (like a lot of other assassins like rengo and kha)
hm85vm2,SituationGood922,11/26/2021,1,92.0,at this exact moment who do you think is the best player on the server if you were to add up their current skill in all 5 roles?  do you think Tyler1 is very near the top?
hm84mqj,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,92.0,Lets say youre playing lulu. Enemy ad has to farm and you can harass them while theyre farming. You can auto space enemy support and auto harass them. Harassing and letting your ad farm safely will always maximize your lead from botlane.

hm7a15j,Agreeable_Junket_271,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,lol Im aware of what emergency means. you seem to be unaware of the concept of subjective experience as in what he considers an emergency is subjective to his own worldview.  whether his reasoning for considering it an emergency will hold up under scrutiny is entirely unknown given that literally no one knows what his situation was
hm7y2yh,_ziyou_,11/26/2021,1,55.0,So jungle would be the second hardest while it was the easiest to get to Masters thats very interesting.

hm8rsvj,FoundationSimple4358,11/26/2021,1,165.0,Banger post. People love treating things like winrates or role comparisons as black and white but reading someone explain some actual depth of context is a pleasure to read
hm7ql85,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,17.0,I think top lane needs the most love that role is horrible to play no one cares about you. Youre either weak sided the entire game or youre expected to carry the game.   I think in general jungle is still always going to be the strongest role and its hard to balance considering how much they can affect every lane.  I think jg/top/ad probably the most 3 toxic roles in order when climbing in under masters. Its probably the same in high elo too when I think about it.
hm7fdsv,MrFuzzyPickles92,11/26/2021,1,144.0,Better than the OG
hm7il80,GodofSteak,11/26/2021,1,130.0,He has a serious case of noobitis.
hm82pgb,bns18js,11/26/2021,1,55.0,Its not what they want to hear. Its just the truth. Support is still the least played by far globally. If nothing else we know for sure statistically we have the least amount of total players in the support position and it is autofilled the most. On top of that people who play support are the least competitive. Like if people get your mom/dad/girlfriend/boyfriend(who arent hardcore gamers) to play the game with them what is the role they gravitate towards by far? Its support. These combined means support mains has the least amount of competition to go up against and climbing in that position is the easiest.   And the above is true even if we assume support is as hard to play as the other roles which its not. Basically everyone(not just DOPA lol) agrees supports are by far the worst mechanically. Their champions do not need high precision nor high speed to function. They dont have to last hit and contest enemy laners at the same time(do not tell me last hitting is easy you have to do it while PvPing too. there is a reason chovys CS numbers are not attainable by everyone even at the pro level). There is some decision making to be made but its not any harder than jungle or mid. The vastly easier mechanical requirements still put it at the easiest.  Nobody is saying a gold Yasuo main deserves D1/masters. But its quite possible that a mid diamond Yasuo main can do it if they switched to support. But D1/masters support mains(esp enchanters) likely cannot even stay at mid diamond if they switched to yasuo. Support mains are simply the worst compared to others at the same elo.

hm78v4z,HemoTalon,11/26/2021,1,108.0,I will say older accounts that have been stuck in lower elos find it incredibly hard to get past where they have been for a few seasons Ive been playing for a long time like 2010 and have been bronze to silver the entire time I took a two year break a few years ago came back and got gold but I needed to have a %70 win rate because my MMR was soo unbelievably fucking terrible and thats just unfair. This year I didnt make it back to gold cause I have had other issues but even so I was at 150 games and %60 win rate stuck in S1/S2 for over 70 games.
hm8duxv,Empty_ManaPotion,11/26/2021,1,113.0,im also above average in math compared to preschoolers but i still suck at math.
hm7e7or,Newfypuppie,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,Did you read my comment?   I didnt say that upset has to tell adam what went down but upset has to at least talk to adam in private and apologize in a more sincere matter.
hm7rkiy,CoalaRebelde,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Right? Adam and Nisqy arent just a name they are real people and got screwed by something they had no say in. I dont get why people are so against them venting their frustrations.
hm7f6o6,xCammo,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,So you are actually thinking that Adam saying publicly on twitter idk why he left so as far as Im concerned Im gonna say his wife felt lonely and he went back to her. Is it true? I dont care is appropriate.  Really fucking wish youd re-evaluate your thoughts.
hm74zed,Idothisformoney,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,Fanatic has never been a team thats like a second family. They have always just been coworkers. Some might be better friends. But most of them are just coworkers. They are not like the mad lions and G2 where they live together eat together and do everything together.

hm84obv,HappyLittleLongUserN,11/26/2021,1,159.0,Well yes if you want to climb from plat to dia. But here its bronze to silver which should be easy enough with how many game this guy plays. Understanding his champion would be the first step.
hm75p28,Wizzdom,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,In this case I dont think there is any reason to believe Upset left for bad reasons. But family emergency is the most generic excuse there is. Surely Upset or management could have done a better job of communicating the severity of what happened without giving away personal details. He wants to keep it private but trust me Id do the same in his shoes.  All that being said I think Adam is more salty about being replaced.
hm7qwun,arcunii,11/26/2021,1,225.0,So obviously theres many splash arts but in all of them the birds have 6.
hm8bqd9,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,108.0,toplane was jax probably because all of them take time warp and cheese you from the brush. jungle kayn (dont need to expalain). mid galio because they always move for team. ad all of them are the same. supp lulu / yuumi because they could make their teammates exodia

Huh... revealed 0 information wasnt hurtful to anyones privacy and conveyed that there was something severe that he needed to be available for.  If only hed told them it was a family emergency... ah wait he did. But apparently now family emergency can also mean something minor... lol.

hm81ake,DariusRivers,11/26/2021,1,150.0,If this is the case this raises a few more questions. The same items that are in the box Caitlyn is carrying are the same items that are in Vis bag that shes filling up with stolen items. Which would have meant those objects existed in two places simultaneously. And if Jayce went to his benefactors first then Ekko would have had the wrong location to give to Vi as a tip. He would have given them the Kirammans place not Jayces lab. Theres just a whole bunch that doesnt really add up and the rule of thumb is that if you have to make some sort of convoluted explanation to make plot points work then they didnt work.  Dont even get me started about Jayce and Mel haha. The development of his character from naive idealist to scummy politician to repentant realist would have been fine over the course of several seasons but definitely not over the course of 9 episodes and DEFINITELY not over the course of how short the in-universe length of time was in Act 2+3 from start to finish. And Mel went from someone who wanted Jayce and Viktor to build hextech weapons to being fervently for peace. I get that her tense relationship with her mother is supposed to have changed her opinions but it was definitely not handled well.  Again if you have to rely on your viewers to make convoluted explanations for plot points then you should have explained better. Caitlyn forging Jayces seal would have been a fairly important part of her whole scheme to talk to the inmates of Stillwater (remember she was there for the big goon first before the warden revealed hed been beaten up by Vi) so if that WAS the case the show should have shown it.
hm7nny5,BurningApe,11/26/2021,1,,This is like typical american mentality - freedom privacy above all. It doesnt mean shit I need freedom to breathe and not wear a mask so I will happily spread covid germs to others.  I need privacy so I would like to leverage this human right to disrespect half of my entire team by not telling them any details about what was so serious that caused me to ditch the most important tournament of their year in the last minute. Sometimes life isnt about rules you can play around those rules however much you want but sometimes its better to be a mature good person and naturally you will have a better outcome. Upset played by the rules of I am entitled to my privacy and look how that ended.  Its extremely unlikely Bwipo or Adam would have leaked it if they were told the truth given that Yamato and the other manager hasnt leaked anything yet.
hm738y2,Saphrogenik,11/26/2021,1,42.0,Lmao different people and situations entirely. Everybody copes differently. Like you coping with the fact Upset would put his family over his team so you assume the worst.

hm88qmm,Kripox,11/26/2021,1,25.0,Vi is not weak she is super strong after the code cleanup she got a little while back. Possibly not in terms of jungler 1v1s at lvl 4 but she is really good overall.

hm71ld3,jaguar317,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Why do his teammates NEED to know the exact reason he left? They already very obviously know he left for a family emergency that needed his immediate attention. Is he really so obligated to say more than that? Also about this second family shit... lmao. Yeah the guy that Upset has known for less than one year who has shown himself to be so unprofessional and douchey that he publicly bashed Upset who has shown himself to be incredibly immature in soloqueue who literally doesnt talk in any of FNCs voice comms is the guy that Upset would tell his most private information to. Adam knew enough. If he was truly a good teammate he would trust that Upset wouldnt leave for some minor petty reason. If you want to talk about being a shitty teammate you have your #1 candidate Adam right there.

hm7eq90,--------V--------,11/26/2021,1,56.0,It absolutely is scummy they are teammates 5 of them depending on one another to win worlds. And you vanish and abandoned them without telling them at the most important point in their career

hm71dfy,mistood,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,People have said that checking the social media of his family everyone seems okay.    The reason has to do with his wife apparently. Before he left he told the team that his wife is feeling bad/ in pain/lonely something along those lines. Its definitley because of his wife.     If his family member was actually dying he could let his teammates know (not the public) and they would understand him. They might not like it but they will understand it. The fact he keeps saying muh privacy makes me believe he doesnt have a real reason. When Perkz and Doublelift had their tragedies the whole community rallied in support of them and understood their situation. I dont understand why he doesnt tell just his teammates he doesnt have to tell the public.
hm8566c,Jiffyyy,11/26/2021,1,143.0,of course it makes things easier this is not about what is easiest this is about boundaries and personal space and respecting it.

hm83d7f,ShavedDragon,11/26/2021,1,23.0,Theres this guy named Vander in the first few episodes and I think he may be twitch. I missed a little bit of the end of episode 3 but he seems to be hiding for the rest of the show. Reminds me of what twitch would do
hm7p93f,BigB_porter,11/26/2021,1,5.0,Alright that makes sense thank you for the response
hm7c4iv,kazuyaminegishi,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,Yes I do lmao what kind of question is that? If something happens that I find far more important than what Im currently doing comes up and it requires my attention then I give it my attention. If it screws someone over I will apologize but thats all they get. My choice wont change just because they feel bad I just have to accept they feel bad.  They can think im lying all they want to it doesnt matter if they want to sleuth into my personal life so they can play judge and jury on whether Im allowed to prioritize different shit from them then thats stupid.  If they dont believe me when I say I find this more important than that well tough for them.  Again you can make it sound as complicated as you want to but the simplistic situation is that Upset felt something important more important than worlds happened. So he left to address that. His teammates dont need to know what that is and it doesnt matter if they think its as important Upset thinks its that important. If they dont believe him they can be mad about it until the day they die it still doesnt mean they need to know anything more.
hm7dxc9,Ok_Dot9858,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,No I don’t. We simply don’t know what happened and that’s all I am stating. Our best guess is to refer to those who know. And they clearly decided even in light of the importance of the upcoming event

hm7fufz,Esmi_Esmenet,11/26/2021,1,147.0,I didnt look into this but it sounds...unlikely because they (Riot) did say they are keeping full control of Arcane. Not sure if Netflix was giving them money to give to a 3rd party animator (that Riot worked with for 8+ years on game cinematics only) for 6 years...and then Netflix basically has nothing. Riot can probably just bugger off and not even deal with NF for season probably + NF doesnt get to change a single frame during the making of...next parts (like it was for this one).
hm7t3f8,TheDiabeticGM,11/26/2021,1,68.0,I think this thread has had some of the best and most interesting discussion that I have come across about the show. Thanks for opening my eyes I hadnt even considered this.

hm70j58,_ziyou_,11/26/2021,1,108.0,Some people just dont care about really getting into the game on a deeper level. And some people just plateau very quickly and do not want to spend the time and effort to get better. Its a game after all and a game is supposed to be fun. Fun is a very subjective thing after all.  I also know someone who does not get past ~ Bronze 2 and he has been playing for many years also. Of course he is into the game but he has no idea about runes still builds some wrong items sometimes and so on.
hm6zszu,Rektile7,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,He can say it but a lot of players would be miffed about getting replaced on the recommendation of the dude who tossed the whole year without telling the team anything

hm8q7j1,ViraLCyclopezz,11/26/2021,1,52.0,This idea makes me want to commit war crimes
hm8t7ha,StevSoko,11/26/2021,1,78.0,The violinist in that scene is just a real person its not Jhin
hm76xfq,rudebrooke,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,He did say if it was his story to tell he would tell it. His family arent public figures and therefore hes not elaborating on the issue.   Stop drama mongering and let the guy be.
hm7vpqi,mocaaaaaaaa,11/26/2021,1,1.0,I have this issue on my G14 when playing in borderless and the display is connected to the AMD iGPU never found a fix
hm8n12b,Tilterino247,11/26/2021,1,191.0,Jensen hates streaming. I assure you man is not happy rn.
hm6zlmp,macrotransactions,11/26/2021,1,162.0,the problem with this mode was that the map update sucked  the altars were just terrible
hm8itr0,Freeman0017,11/26/2021,1,12350.0,I dont think that Jinx jinxed it either they just were agreeing with his plan and the deal he made with Silco wich include him handing over her in so my best guess is that season 2 is not about war but everyone hunting her down Vi just rushing agains the clock to save her or stop her before she does something worse
hm7c002,Sushi2k,11/26/2021,1,125.0,Damn take that TL flair off. Slandering Xmithie like that smh.
hm6yead,Rwings,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,No they dont. His personal life is no ones business. Getting feedback from the peanut gallery on anything besides his play is asinine.
hm84n04,swellbaby,11/26/2021,1,291.0,There are variations?
hm7jyww,ExcellentPastries,11/26/2021,1,198.0,Speaking solely to upside/potential Summit and Berserker have way higher ceilings than TL’s top and bot. Fudge could end the season better than Bjerg but I think only the most extreme C9 fans think that’s going to happen. Blaber and Santorin are both fairly known quantities but when he’s playing at his best Blaber is simply better.  I can’t stress how much this all relies on everything going right - their ceiling is high but their floor is low. TL even at its worst should still be a top 2 team in NA. C9 at its worst is like scraping into playoffs and praying for a miracle run. If I’m betting money on who goes to MSI it’s TL by a mile then 100T then C9.
hm85oq4,sp0j,11/26/2021,1,111.0,They are meaningful. It means you have no control over your career.
hm85y36,Fyne_,11/26/2021,1,291.0,its sad that op feels eune is dead and it has basically the same size as NA
hm7qla9,HNIC1995,11/26/2021,1,110.0,I like both for different reasons.  It is really fun to follow a BB season through the live feeds.  I think overall Survivor is the better show and I wish they could rework BB in some way to bring back some of that old magic.  Ill keep watching though because I can pretend is better than other reality tv.
hm84nqs,WhatIMeantT0SayWas,11/26/2021,1,39.0,....you know that hashtags dont do anything on reddit right?
hm7jccv,NUFC9RW,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Its fine wanting to replace someone but they shouldnt find out through social media.

hm8socq,Loose-Potential-3597,11/26/2021,1,121.0,That was the real finals
hm7h1b6,I_am_not_Serabia,11/26/2021,1,1301.0,Some people here are like:  Upset? Leave him alone hes got family issues.  The rest of the team? Fuck them upset got family issues.  Why is it so hard to understand that the whole team got fked by the situation. Sure people should be angry how adam decided to handle the whole stuff but they shouldnt be surprised and angry that his is mad. Really you all guys are so much supportive and all but if something happened to you and everything you worked on went straight to the trash bin you also wouldnt be pleased and would like to at least understand why.
hm7l36x,Tangbat,11/26/2021,1,80.0,Ya its much easier without boosters in pre season doesn t it.
hm78kqa,DT-Z0mby,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,its also super cringe. why be proud about something you have no influence over as if its your accomplishment
hm7h8at,computo2000,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,That sounds really cringe.
hm8rc5u,imjunsul,11/26/2021,1,58.0,Its most likely Showmaker/Faker if hes talking about it right now during off season lol.. or else he would have re-signed already. But there is still a chance for him to play with iG since he should feel more comfortable with Rookie. Hope Zeus gets to play full-time or he should just join DK or stick with iG.
hm78y3q,JustAppleJuice,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,> more than 12 hours  Im impartial to this drama but damn the irony made me chuckle.

hm79gep,PomegranateMaterial,11/26/2021,1,7.0,Yeah my bad mate. If it is like that then its a pretty smooth tease isnt it?
hm6y7i7,-LostInCloud-,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,How are they supposed to communicate this?  > Upset had to leave cant provide details sadly  Should have been the end of everything. When some people feel entitled to other peoples private information I dont think thats something you can handle anyhow.  In some way they have handled it with Adam and Bwipo being gone next split so they wont poison the team anymore.
hm7sbvo,Bonsparks,11/26/2021,1,3.0,Your LP just has 0 impact on your life.  Just say it sucks and move on.

hm6zpj3,frenkli_h,11/26/2021,1,21.0,it litteraly has nothing to do because i faced 1 champ  out of 50 champs ive faced today   even tho i smashed her on the game u are talking about. like whatt bro ???? nice logic  edit: after some resarch u litteraly spent ur whole day on reddit shitting on the post i made and on the comments  i guess there is more to it then XD dont get so offended and take things personal
hm7yrdj,ViraLCyclopezz,11/26/2021,1,27.0,Hopefully new void jungler has at least some dinosaur resemblance

hm79gz1,SP3EDI,11/26/2021,1,144.0,pls let them stay at EUNE. dont get them to play permanently on EUW.
hm7i2vj,Gaarando,11/26/2021,1,144.0,Ok and now rewatch EG vs C9 and see how poorly Danny did. Also 100T improved while TL got worse and thats why 100T won the split.
hm7vj5o,Pretty_Airline_5063,11/26/2021,1,17.0,Tyler2
hm8a5jp,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,108.0,When youre a midlaner that roleswaps to support you feel like a 8th grader at an elementary school. You can easily trade on enemy bot laners. You can help your ad wave manage and prevent being ganked for the most part. Being a support you know what your sidelaners need. Teamfighting is basically the same as you just either support your DPS or you engage which might be the only skill that really isnt found in midlane all that often.
hm8r9qh,windswepts,11/26/2021,1,3.0,420 hehe
hm7xp16,Lohenngram,11/26/2021,1,66.0,This is where it turns out theyre a LoR player instead
hm7d7pp,Regrup,11/26/2021,1,2.0,im not arguing that
hm7wl3b,BigB_porter,11/26/2021,1,,Yeah thats a good way of thinking
hm8rvn2,The4thJames,11/26/2021,1,24.0,Yasuo yone and viego all have crit scaling so they benefit from building crit items and they are intentionally meant to build those items. Irelia builds bork first and then has a few options but shieldbow has a lot of what she wants out of an item (attack speed  AD  life steal tankyness from the sheild and passive stats). I imagine riot would like CCS built more but people may just not be catching on to it on the champs its good on. From what I see nasus players just tend to sit on the bramble cus they get what they want and it lets them rush more important items like frozen and spirit. If you dont benefit from finishing thornmail dont get it till 6 items and hope someone on your team gets anti heal.
hm8g0gk,Halseyqueen,11/26/2021,1,75.0,Yes she did and she is working on Arcane Jinx atm!
hm7o8fa,BBQMasterDad,11/26/2021,1,19.0,Depends what ELO you’re in honestly. Anything under Plat I’d say fuck the wave state and just take what you want. Do you seriously think some pisslow Gold knows anything about wave management? Now this being said if the wave LOOKS like it’s in a good spot I wouldn’t touch it such as your laner is walking back into lane and a nice wave is built up even if unintentional.
hm8m4v8,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,140.0,It depends on the ranks. I will just speak for under masters. The diffs are kind of half true. Example youre playing jayce top and are forced to leash + weaksided. Of course youre not going to be able to play the game so in that sense it is jungle diff but at the same time you can do things to minimize your deficit when put into certain scenarios.
hm7g2n4,TemporaMoras,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,People are overblowing Adam importance in their run during summer so much LMAO.  He was without a doubt the weakest part of the team.

hm75ddd,babylovesbaby,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,I get why it is obnoxious for them to refuse but if its that big of an issue why did you never learn French?
hm7np3y,uncertainrandompal,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,he also said yamato knew and advised him to go home while yamato himself said in interview he didn’t know anything.  Upset doing is exactly what expected - damage control with zero new information.  also “needed my immediate attention” and playing arams with his wife whole day and days after as well looks like bullshit as well.
hm7a6zp,gridemann,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,Exactly if anything all of these shallow non-answers are validating Adams version even more.  Reddit is truly something else.
hm76lze,Jad94,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,? So we are quantifying personal emergencies? Nah your dad is in a life threatening coma? Naw you can only go if your mom is also in a coma  What kind of stupid ideology is that???
hm76jtx,Tanriyung,11/26/2021,1,4.0,0. I disagree with the premise that League is a crush or be crushed game most of my games are close with often some form of comebacks.  1. The point I disagree the most with you are basically asking to delete some champions outright. Also targeted abilities are not unfair they are stronger than skillshot by default but thats taken into account in the balance.   2. The only real result youd get from that is an increase in bot leveled accounts which makes it worse for new player as those bots uses coop vs ai.  Youll slightly increase the average skill in ranked overall but that wont actually change the experience for anyone as you are matchdd with players of your skill anyway.  3. Sure itd be nice not actually that important through. People oversell tutorials.  4. Would stop players from trading champions during pick phase and generally would increase massively the toxicity in normal games because ranked players would feel forced to play normals terrible idea.  5. Sure would be nice not gonna happen through and you already know why.  6. Text based tips are the 2nd worst way to make people learn something so itd be useless but sure I wouldnt be against it as it would be optional.
hm8mytn,Ciscodiscoisvibing,11/26/2021,1,8.0,when im last pick playing support i sometimes ask my toplaner who they want me to ban since i know mathcups are so much more relevant in there  im not sure if it helps that much but its atleast something.
hm8nzc9,schemeup,11/26/2021,1,58.0,I really hope its Faker after he saw how he tried to enable Canna. Would love for T1 to have both Zeus and TheShy.

hm7veww,-Ophidian-,11/26/2021,1,24.0,What does chicken have to do with this 😏
hm75uhs,After_Signature_6580,11/26/2021,1,4.0,They said they were working on it for over 5 years. Im sure lots was already planned and completed years ago.
hm79fy5,TH3RM4L33,11/26/2021,1,55.0,Yep the spell just has to hit. Its kinda the same principle with bug #7. You just have to press the button but the spell doesnt have to cast.
hm7o4mg,eddeadcosta,11/26/2021,1,22.0,Ay just drag the champion to the top of the scoreboard and the note icon will pop up. Guess it is a bug
hm7lz86,JumpscareRodent,11/26/2021,1,86.0,Shacos boxes and Heimerdingers turrets display the old portrait icon in-game when you target them. Top left. Not sure if you can fix those :)
hm7d8k8,cav2010,11/26/2021,1,,Yep. The only peoples that should know is his employer since his employer view this as serious situation and feel like he not going to in right state of mind of to play. The let him leave and side with him for this situation sure his teammates could be piss but to drag him out to public like this is to far. They should really talk one on one with him instead
hm89wp0,Haramwey,11/26/2021,1,150.0,They hated Jesus because he told the truth  Dude married a camwhore he’d been with for a couple months and rushed home to make sure she wasn’t banging the neighbors.
hm7o80v,ACertainUser123,11/26/2021,1,,Isnt that the same thing? He was approached by Fnatic and advised them they should get alphari? So he wanted to replace Adam.
hm7s5jp,zUkUu,11/26/2021,1,15.0,It doesnt has to be. 😏
hm814bt,Xyexs,11/26/2021,1,277.0,Im very confident that we are defaukted to eune. I saw a swedish streamer register an account yesterday and even back in season 4 i got lvl 20 on eune before swapping to euw.  Edit: https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Servers
hm87rif,ImTheNguyenerOne,11/26/2021,1,93.0,From everything Ive read on reddit so taken with a grain of salt his streaming contract got sold by RNG to someone else and supposedly ends sometime in December.
hm71p4x,frenkli_h,11/26/2021,1,49.0,ik i just forget sometimes i still won the game and carried tho all good idk why people in these comments are these mad and try to judge  every single right click i had
hm7z2ov,Jonoabbo,11/26/2021,1,,Wunder is past his prime because of one bad split? Saying he was terrible the entire year is just not true. He was worse than his usual standard but by no means terrible.   No player will be flawless every season and if one bad season means you should never be on a top tier again the entire cast of top tier players would need to be replaced with rookies.
hm84x1i,bns18js,11/26/2021,1,,>Cant take you seriously if you dont understand the role  Can you take DOPA or doublelift or basically everyone else who play this game seriously though? Its a well known consensus that support is the easiest. This aint just me saying it lol.  >Enchanters at a high level are much better mechanically than engage tanks that have one job to occasionally throw all their spells out. Watch how challenger Janna players lane. On ranged auto attack supports the entire laning battle contesting cs is incredibly similar to midlane  I mean... Sure? Thats not a high bar though. I can honestly agree Janna is mechanically harder than Naut or Leona. Hey Ill even give it to Soraka Lmao.  But compared to champs in other roles like Irelia Yasuo Lee Sin and Vayne? Or even Camile Ekko Graves and Cait? None of the support champs even hold up a candle even if were just talking about PvPing this is not even considering that whole having to CS the whole game while PvPing aspect.
hm74kac,moroheus,11/26/2021,1,42.0,Your insecurities
hm7tsvb,Poughy14,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Its not that hard this management is just terrible.   How hard is it to say he has to leave because of family medical condition/death he ask you to support him in this time and he ask us to remain private about this and to not be asked furthermore   Take 5 min its the f minimum for your teammates and I insist teammates not coworkers
hm7ngdq,xGlaedr,11/26/2021,1,,They kinda do though.  Killing an enemy champion resets its Bounty = Getting a tower gives you the bounty doesnt reset cause well the objective doesnt exist anymore  Any other Bounty is still active in both cases. Unless Im blind and getting one shut down makes the other Champ Bounties disappear
hm6zuh9,bondsmatthew,11/26/2021,1,144.0,Auto attack more! I see it especially from supports in trades. It can be the difference between a lot trade and a won trade. Go to poke an enemy in lane as Zyra for example? Throw down a W Q auto instead of just a W Q. Midlane as Ahri? Throw an auto in with your Q to add 60 extra damage. Just because youre an AP champion doesnt mean your autos do 0 damage
hm7ifk3,beezel-,11/26/2021,1,79.0,Hes fine right now. Hes just like any other snowbally assassin.  Talon was already a permaroaming midlaner. Making his jungling easier changes nothing.
hm78bbu,maidboy,11/26/2021,1,62.0,understandable your friends didnt care as it is preseason + las server + pisslow
hm7v042,nikmaier42069,11/26/2021,1,252.0,Same for german when randoms throw the h word around at 10 mins its doomed
hm8stuc,Heliotex,11/26/2021,1,,The Sentinel event was skins first story second. They chose which champs to be part of the skinline and then forced a random flimsy story that connected them together without any regard for established canon.  They saw that the dating sim style with the Spirit Blossom events was successful so they thought people would like a self-insert rookie character. However that works for the former not the latter. Especially when paired with cringe dialogue.
hm7sna2,leagueoflegendsdog,11/26/2021,1,252.0,Aw... Do your feelings get hurt by what people think?
hm83zs9,Pillow51,11/26/2021,1,107.0,Damn Kcorp 2 is looking nice !
hm71jv3,HeckAryan,11/26/2021,1,141.0,What if somebody did ask huh what then? Im sure they were quite satisfied with the answer. But you no you cannot for the life of you find a way to somehow think about what someone else thinks or feels. When you imply that nobody asked youre talking solely about yourself. The world doesnt revolve around you. Try to find the simple joys of life instead of wasting perhaps the best years of your life away sitting in your shit smeared cheeto dust covered cum bespeckled ergonomic office chair. Maybe start working out think about somebody other than you secure yourself a date anything will work so long as you get the fuck outside and stop asking who asked every 2 fucking minutes because quite frankly nobody asked for your opinion as well. Youre but a speck of extra stinky shit in a pile of manure thats all the significance you have in this world but you can change that with 4 simple words: Shutting the fuck up. Thank you and have a good day
hm77dtf,Wompond,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Reddit vultures don’t need to know
hm7bl16,cptlf,11/26/2021,1,39.0,Something happened in the team. There is 0 communication as to why players decided to leave.
hm7b7vf,sukazu,11/26/2021,1,115.0,Balance my friend           If the goal is to improve you should definitly have sessions where you try to not die and focus on csing / map movements      And some sessions where you limit test      It doesnt matter that youll lose more in short term.       If the goal is to climb you should play agressive if youre significantly better than the elo youre playing in     Or passive if similar.  Reducing potential errors and not tilting will get you further than trying to outplay peoples of similar level.
hm8mjgs,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,140.0,In toplane I really learned the importance of trading and matchups in general even when playing other roles. Since youre put onto an island you really need to minmax to have an impact later but its really applicable to other roles. In jungle you learn to look at lanes a lot more. Midlane is just jack of all trades role. Ad you learn to get the most amount of gold. Support you learn how to support. I think what improved me the most when playing midlane was definitely playing toplane. Since you learn almost every role from playing mid in some sort of way given you play x champion the only real thing is getting better at trading imo.
hm7hacq,the-lonely-corki,11/26/2021,1,53.0,How the fuck has no one said rumble? He has 7 main runes he can run and he can be played in every single role without being considered troll besides maybe adc and even that ain’t bad rumble has got to be the most versatile with gragus slightly below   There are several different items you can take with rumble as well the only thing rumble can do is become a tank
hm6y8e9,xnalem,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Probably that Carlos wouldn‘t sell to fnatic
hm81ve5,LookinForDatSixPack,11/26/2021,1,2.0,For anyone who is curious I ended up playing Darius mid because my mid lane didnt want to play Kassadin into Sylas. He ended up letting the enemy Kat top get fed but it all worked out in the end! It was a fun first game to start my evening with :)
hm7g4yu,traumatized_for_life,11/26/2021,1,100.0,it is canon. arcane is retconning leagues lore and its for the better. leagues original lore was made by sweaty white nerds who took inspiration from other sweaty white nerds so you have this ridiculous foundation that lacks deprh diversity and substance.  caitlyn has half-ionian heritage now and looks less like a british carnival prostitute. Jayce looks hispanic now instead of generic white techno superman.

hm7qh6y,JamisonDouglas,11/26/2021,1,252.0,Yeah dude this has been common knowledge for a while now. If your account is fresh (as in 0 ranked games played) and you spam normals as a 5 stack while grinding to and try hard you will have stupid LP games/minimal losses and be able to climb like a rocket ship even with a sub 50% win rate. Same for flex. As long as the account hasnt played ranked your non ranked games can alter your MMR. Tarzaned released a guide on it right before he stopped trying at all in soloq and basically said your first 20 normal games drastically alter your MMR and showed the effects.   Just look up normal game MMR exploit and pick a sauce that looks to your taste theres many to choose from. Has been this case for at least a year. Yamatosdeath got found out doing it like this time last year for doing it which is when I think the general populatuon learned about it. God knows how long its actually been the case for/how long people have been using it. They claimed to have fixed it at the start of the season but it still works just slightly less effectively.

hm7z89p,Poluact,11/26/2021,1,277.0,I think it would be less. English vocabulary has more words in general. I tried an online tool and it found 22k 7-letter words. I skimmed through it and it also includes multiple grammar forms. I dont know how large is vocabulary this site uses though.  But ok lets err on the side of caution and say its 100k words. Now calculating the probability is tricky because words and letters are not all equal some are used more often some less there are other rules like amount of contiguous consonants and vowels you can typically have in a word etc-etc. But lets say theyre all equal for simplicity. Russian have 33 letters but one of them is usually just ignored and replaced with other similar letters.  So we have 100k 7-letter words consisting from a combination of 32 letters. We put 7 letters in random order how do we calculate probability we hit one of them?  ----------  Edit: ok the amount of completely random 7-letter words we can do with an alphabet of 32 letters is 32^7 = 34359738368 right? So the probability would be 100000/34359738368 ≈ 0.0000029 or 0.00029%. Is that correct with all the assumptions made?

hm6zmw5,SaulJoker,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Reddit can’t take no for an answer.  I can only imagine what Upset and his family is going through especially his wife. I truly hope they’re doing alright.  Also fuck Adam for his unprofessionalism. Yeah I understand he must he frustrated with the situation but “I’m not trying to start drama” after writing 3 paragraphs which do exactly that is not the way to approach this.  Seriously man how could you possibly ever think that Upset leaving right before the most important tournament of the year is due to a petty reason?  Do you seriously think Upset wanted the team to crash and burn? Or Fnatic management? Bwipo has expressed his frustration but he certainly didn’t seem to think Upset was lying. Neither did Nisqy or Hyli. So why should you?  Praising himself pointing fingers at Upset and badmouthing both the org and his former teammates.  Pathetic.

hm8jgkh,rjaydo2,11/26/2021,1,21.0,This is definitely prevalent in the lower elos (low diamond and below) but once you get to d2+ theres a very very small chance the game comes back. I think this is what the last commenter was trying to say. Once youre in a higher elo bracket its probably because you make sure you win your games that youre 20 kills ahead. Its not ALL of the time but nothing is worse than exerting yourself for 30 mins in a 3-4 hour session on a game you never had a chance in because the lane you strong-sided lost along with the others. Playing that out past even plat just feels extremely bad. Theres times where the game is truly 90% chance of being over.

hm7l4s4,KeijiKiryira,11/26/2021,1,5.0,If you’re super far ahead and are unable to only push one lane putting more pressure on the enemy by destroying multiple lanes is useful. But if you’re unable to push your lane and are ahead moving to mid/top and getting those turrets usually helps because then bot lane may be empty allowing that to be pushed if there aren’t any large fights to join in.

hm8jvxq,Majeh666,11/26/2021,1,315.0,English is the most commonly taught 2nd language and pretty much anyone born after the 90s that graduated high school can speak English to a decent albeit broken level. And these are everyday people some of whom dont ever interact with the english language except in tv shows and movies.    Talking to anyone that looks older than 40-50 in english is a complete crapshot some might know a word or two picked up from the tv while the others will look at you like youre drunk or possessed.     On eune in 10/10 games the players speak in English or at the very least start speaking in English before degenerating to insulting in their own language aka the classic kurwa jebany ja pierdole etc.

hm7o6ue,HuaRong,11/26/2021,1,120.0,Its comments like yours part of the reason why Riot doesnt communicate much. As soon as someone says anything you jump on them and ask them to do a bunch of work theyre not even responsible for.
hm8qq7j,rjaydo2,11/26/2021,1,26.0,I play ranked to gain LP that is correct. I enjoy that aspect because then I play at a higher level push myself to think harder and more creatively and I enjoy the competition as a whole. I have my fun in clash and nornals or flex with friends then take this part more seriously. Im not toxic about it but when Im looking to gain LP and only have a limited time to play I dont waste my time on a game we are down 12-0 in 10 mins and I havent been able to touch a jungle camp in 2 mins. The odds of coming back are very very slim.   Im not rank shaming but have you played in the aforementioned ranks? You dont get up there if you dont at least have some idea how to close out a game. Please also recall Im describing D2+. I dont ff on any alt account simply because it IS a problem in the game for many people that dont understand what a lost game really looks/feels like.

hm80ynv,bns18js,11/26/2021,1,55.0,> Ive been challenger for 5 seasons now.  Here is the answer. OP is a long time challenger someone who is extremely good and much better than barely getting to masters. He is **practically smurfing** on his way to masters. So really he is just saying support takes the longest to get there with his very specific situation which makes sense because its hard to completely 1v9 smurf on support champions no matter how much better you are.   Which OP basically said by explaining in another post---  >Being a support that is significantly better than everyone else in the game is not going to have as much of an impact when comparing it to any other role.  But for someone playing at their absolute peak the situation is completely different. This is what DOPA is talking about. For people playing at their peak level trying to climb support is the easiest because it requires less skill especially mechanical. So for someone who is limited by their own abilities support is the path of least resistance and would allow people to get to a higher ranking than otherwise possible with anything else. This is what people call elo inflated and it is largely accurate.  **TLDR**: Its hard to completely 1v9 as support when youre playing at a skill level below you like what OP is doing. But if youre limited by your abilities at your peak support demands the least amount of of skill and therefore is still the easiest. DOPA is not wrong.
hm7yqy6,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,55.0,Correct. In lower elos you can get away with a lot of things. Ex. getting kills on the sidelane youre full clearing to full clearing counter jungling. In high elo laners are a lot more reactive to jungle and making decisions become much more difficult.

hm7svm1,Coc0tte,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Youre saying that like Upset didnt commit years of his own life to the game and the competition and like he didnt work very hard during this whole year. And you almost make it sounds like he left on purpose and without consequences for himself.  If he left its because he had good reasons to and even Yamato was concerned about Upsets situation when he learned what happened. Upset was certainly devastated by the situation but yet people still blame him and harrass him non-stop. It was never the fault of Upset that things happened to his family why would people blame him ? Why cant people respect his privacy especially since he shared the details of the situation to the team management ? Its very clear that he would not have left if it was not a VERY serious issue.  And he is right to not trust his teammates about keeping his privacy secret it would definitely have been leaked to the public eventually (especially when you see Adam posting random shit to create drama) so I totally understand his decision to hide the details to his teammates.  People should just stop being assholes and treat him like a human being accepting that family issues can happen and that people are not required to share their private life.
hm7dra6,Dark-Dragon,11/26/2021,1,166.0,Valorant isnt any better from what I can tell. Accounts are hardlocked to a region there and without a VPN or someone to create account for you I dont think you can even create an account to play on a different region.  Either way Riot fucked up big time when they announced their whole Riot games account making things global and whatsoever while completely failing to deliver on the promise. I distinctly remember them almost stealing my account name because its not globally unique whereas Im like yeah of course its not I had to create like 4 different accounts including PBE to play the game LUL.  Meanwhile instead of needing just one account to play globally I had to create another new account because even my NA LoL account was region bound to Europe when I tried to use it to play Valorant with my American friends. This entire clusterfuck is such a 1998 experience of a hassle. Just let me use one account to play wherever I want it really shouldnt be so hard.

hm7ijew,nyasiaa,11/26/2021,1,130.0,I used to think that so I made it a super deep habit to look at minimap and I can do that in a way that doesnt hinder my normal play at all  now I will never miss anyone missing ever I mute everyones pings and I can probably see that someone is missing on any lane possibly before the laners themselves realise that and ping that   if I have a deep ward I can see any gank way in advance 100% of the time   The problem is that.. its not really helpful. Most of the time the jungler is missing so what play super mega safe all the time? Im just gonna achieve nothing because of that. I see them bot lane that still doesnt give me anything. I need to know how much exactly it takes for them to get from bot lane to top lane because every single wave manipulation decision depends on that. And I dont know that because I dont know what camps they will take along the way I dont know how fast this champion clears what camps are already cleared based on the timing of the gank. If my deep ward gets cleared Im basically as good as if I didnt ever look at the minimap. Often I see a jungler from far away I think they wont be able to gank me and suddenly it turns out that they just pop predator flash ult whatever stun and I still die. Often I think that even if they gank me Im still safe. Nope didnt expect items and runes to deal way too much damage. Or maybe they are coming my lane what now? nothing my lane is fucked anyways because I was building a slow push into enemy because I didnt predict the pathing of the jungler and I didnt even think about it being a possibility. Instead of making less errors Im making different errors.    Learning to use the minimap has only shown me how much I suck at the game dunning kruger at its fullest I guess

hm7zd7m,ConscienceNot,11/26/2021,1,20.0,Talking about lvl 4. He can beat Xin. He beats trundle. He beats hecarim. He beats Vi ( she is kinda weak this season ). He beats graves. He beats Jarvan. He beats Kayn. He beats ekko. He beats gragas. He beats Lee. He can beat Noc. He beats Viego. He beats Reksai. He beats Zac. He beats even shyvana if I remember correctly.  He doesnt beat WW Olaf Voli and Scarner and Yi because of his fkin W. And udyr.
hm7arcs,SilveredUndead,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,Maybe Im particularly coloured by this sort of stuff in particular but if his wife tried to take her own life I cannot imagine any world where he would even be remotely ready to talk roster moves as quickly as he was. I dont know if you fully realize how hard it hits you when someone close to you tries to do this sort of thing.   It also really doesnt matter. Its not for the public to know only those close to him that he trusts. Which doesnt include his own teammates that got him to Worlds hence the drama.
hm7ud3n,howtopayherefor,11/26/2021,1,551.0,But its not precise at all. I assume that you wouldnt be able to do anything else while charging forward so its not like youre multitasking and the different zones are huge: literally quadrants of the whole map. Why would you even click near the edges?  If ADCs can kite by rapidly alternating between clicking exactly on an opponent and clicking where they want to move several times a second Mordekaiser players should be able to decide after a second of channel time which quadrant of the screen their mouse should be at.
hm7aw8p,AnxiousEzrael,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,I mean if 3 of his teammates were in the dark and not given even a cursory explanation its definitely on Yamato and the management.  They dont have to give them all the info (or us). They had to placate them in some way. Upset deserves his privacy but as DL said you dont get to have that when youre a public figure
hm8tunp,Riot_Koyuncu,11/26/2021,1,20.0,👀 Thanks for the detailed list - seems like preseason introduced some unintended behavior.
hm7osue,adek13sz,11/26/2021,1,252.0,Its more than 1ms and depends on location but there wont be login queues nowadays. So worth it.
hm8s1o8,imjunsul,11/26/2021,1,27.0,HLE needs to do what Sandbox is doing and just get young players and develop and hope they stay in the future. HLE does have the $ to keep their players.
hm785wi,rudebrooke,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,I guess you dont understand the word emergency then do you?   Here Ill help you out.   Emergency: a serious unexpected and often dangerous situation requiring immediate action.  If you think that a close one is in urgent trouble projects a more serious issue than there is a serious family emergency and I have to leave Ill have some of what youre on thanks.

hm7pgea,No_Principle_4593,11/26/2021,1,,The question was if he should have to justify leaving worlds to his bosses and team mates which is indeed a management matter
hm7hye3,No_Principle_4593,11/26/2021,1,74.0,Let me tell you the vast majority of the world doesnt work like that for a good reason people leaving work at their will without proper justification of any kind get them fired or at least a warning in any serious and half decent work environment.
hm7w8q9,SylentSymphonies,11/26/2021,1,,Well it happened yesterday and it was TOTALLY a bug
hm73v61,BHowe1205,11/26/2021,1,42.0,are you saying that short of death theres *literally not a single thing* you can think of that could have happened to Upsets family to justify him going home? im not speculating on what happened but if someone in his family had been assaulted or was suffering mental health issues (among many other similar bad things) then i fully understand his decision  &#x200B  also its really shitty to judge a woman based on her past relationships that you know nothing about or for the fact that she did sex work and then to use that judgement to influence whether or not his reasoning was good enough. legit just the type of harassment and speculation that Upset asked people not to do
hm7ag29,hixagit,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,If we only had to give information on what peoples business is we would never talk with anyone on anything. Yamato telling Adam.he knows the issue and think Upset is right to leave in that situation doesnt hurt anyone and only help Adam and the other players. No idea why some of you think nobody should communicate anything ever.

hm7pikn,firechaox,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,He said that the reason he was told (girlfriend is sad) wouldnt be a good enough reason and be doesnt think its what actually happened (as can be implied by him saying until Im told what actually happened). But that until hes told otherwise its what hes going to run with... its exactly what he said... I dont see how you read it differently...
hm7k8xw,WervieOW,11/26/2021,1,22.0,I can only assume you are low elo and I do not mean to insult you. But “just CC” doesn’t apply to tanks for once Yone is not tanky he has self sustain as long he is not CC’ed.   “Just CC” is harder on range champions and high mobility champions that can be difficult to predict. Yones mobility is rather straight forward his ult has an indicator and so does his E.   There is a reason why Yone is sitting on a steady negative winrate.  Yes he has that 1v5 potential if he gets super fed but so does Kassa Vlad Kata Yasuo Cassio Kayn Darius the list is endless.   Take it or leave it but negative winrate on average is not a broken champion.
hm7scsd,CryptographerAny1442,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,For one series while holding horrible stats during the entire split. Adam was not a good player he just happened to be on a good team and he should have been grateful for that.
hm6y90z,zNYNz,11/26/2021,1,8.0,No thanks.  That just means the scrapgoat for losing the match is readily presented to the team by the game.  In fact it will probably increase toxicity in a way that is harder to punish (e.g. game play toxicity).
hm7hact,--------V--------,11/26/2021,1,74.0,I can’t stand the LEC I was glad they lost but this was some bush league bull shit and I don’t need to know the reason but his teammates sure as fuck did. How can anyone justify him not telling him teammates? I will never get that hoe you can abandon your teammates without giving them a reason.
hm84epo,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,92.0,wtf it just auto corrected it to THE 🐐
hm8f7zc,castrozaka,11/26/2021,1,118.0,EUW Diamond as a whole is legitimately NA Masters-GM level.
hm7w5ni,lolKhamul,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,> Youre saying that like Upset didnt commit years of his own life to the game and the competition and like he didnt work very hard during this whole year. And you almost make it sounds like he left on purpose and without consequences for himself.  Never ever said that. But if he ruins only his own committed time (if hed play a 1v1 esport) its not affecting anyone else. Thats a major fucking difference to making that move in a team environment. Nobody can blame him for throwing his time down the drain. They blame him because he threw away their invested time.  > If he left its because he had good reasons .....  The reason doesnt matter and neither does whether it was justified. Its fucking irrelevant. The public doesnt need to know. We will never know. Even if we knew it would not fucking matter what we think about it. Its not even relevant what you or anyone else thinks about him as a person and how he would act. **All that changes nothing. In the end his decision ruined the year of all other FNC players and staffers. And thats a fucking indisputable fact and they have every fucking right to be mad about it. Especially since they cant even get closure because they dont know why.**   Upset owes the public jack shit. Not an explanation nor a reason. And the public doesnt have any right to threat him bad. But everyone on that FNC team does. And imo he ows every single staffer on FNC an explanation whether he trusts them or not.
hm87bl0,bed-sores,11/26/2021,1,92.0,i don’t get how the mechanics thing can be wholly applied to a role like that. top lane is full of mechanically brain dead champs and support has a lot of mages that also get played mid. unless we’re only counting last hitting which seems like a very narrow definition of mechanics.  seems more accurate to say certain categories of champs (enchanters as you said) are mechanically easier than to try and base it on roles that all have a variety of mechanical difficulty within them.  edit:also im relatively new to the game and not that good at it so im not saying you’re wrong just that i don’t really get it.
hm77yce,CronicSmoked,11/26/2021,1,92.0,So i did all 4 of these quests. It says i got the capsule but its not in my League of Legends inventory. Does anyone know how to fix it?
hm8e4u5,hpl2000,11/26/2021,1,,Except the average person isn’t a preschooler lol. Are you better than the average person that took maths all the way through highschool? That’s a fair baseline to see if you’re better than the average.
hm7izk7,Craftingistheway,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Yeah you like a bit more but you aka the other players are not entilted to AT ALL. Not even the tninest bit giga hard and 1000% NOPE. You are not owned jack shit for an explanation further that the org approved of Upsets reasoning and resulting action to leave. They have the information to judge it.  THis is literally just 2 immature kids being butthurt that someone didnt deem them trustworthy and oh what a surprise he was right to do so.
hm7cukb,V1pArzZ,11/26/2021,1,102.0,When i played twitch jungle i won a lot of games by level 2 ganking their top then repeatganking when they tp up. Many toplaners just straightup go afk and flame in chat after that.
hm7eopu,Tuelegend,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,perhaps thats why those 3 left and only upset and hyli stayed.  fnatic got a good roster and can only rival vitality
hm7ekpy,deediazh,11/26/2021,1,62.0,Its weird he is in fact the most mentioned player in every conversation involving promising NA talent which to be fair not many people have. General Sniper gets front page flashy clips but there is no competitive proof yet he is going to be good contrary to Kenvi. People just assume every spectator have the same level of involvement with the NA scene as other fans.
hm7uk8s,Roadrollerdesu,11/26/2021,1,9.0,Doesnt vlad top get run down repeatedly and bruteforced by every single toplaner with some mobility? Like i cant see how he may survive against Jax/Shen/Mundo/Kled/Fiora/Irelia/Camille/Riven/Tahm Kench/Nasus/Trynd/Gwen/Renekton.

hm71enw,th3kandyking,11/26/2021,1,108.0,I dont want to be that guy that defends your friend....and anyone can argue this all they want. Bronze and Silver are a different beast. Some games truly are at the mercy of your teamates. I have a friend that could easily lane and win a game in G3-P4 but the dude is stuck in Bronze - Silver. Why?   Well he plays ADC and try as you might you are somewhat dependent on your support. Who may deserve to be in bronze. Now Im not saying my friend doesnt have a lot of improvement to make but thats video games in general. No one has a perfect game.   That being said I believe the very best thing you can do if you Shouldnt be in Silver Or Shouldnt be in Bronze or Shouldnt be in gold lol. Play 2-4 Champs max grind in a role that can carry (top/mid/jg) and grind out games on the same champs over and over until you dont use u.gg because you know the match-up and you know exactly what to do based on their comp and your role and how you plan to win the game.   If thats via enabling your team or split pushing towers until nexus you find your niche. But blaming others and doing the same thing on repeat is why you get Hardstuck.   If you go 5/1/1 as the ADC but Always lose because top gets feed and shits on me  Maybe you should go top get feed and shit on other people?   Its a mental block for sure because Im the say way. lol.  if you are better than the elo you are in then you will eventually climb especially if you play 1000 games.   If you are not....well then thats the elo you belong in for now. I can say that doing the same thing and blaming teamates etc isnt going to get your Winrate up.   Most players refuse to even acknowledge that their mechanics are horrible like an ADC that doesnt A click. Or a mage that clicks on themselves to self cast as opposed to using alt or a hotkey.   Point being there is no way you are below Plat and have no way to improve mechanically and individually.  but there is a possibility that you ARE good enough and hinder yourself even before the game starts with role champ select and other things like not muting all chat and team chat 🤣  good luck out there guys.

hm7e2vw,fullyuncooly,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,Adam was a known liability his champm pool and playstyle just dont cut it internationally and Nisqy is also known to shit the bed internationally. Fnatic wanted to replace them and then asked Upset about his opinion on possible replacements.
hm7vuyt,akutasame94,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,He didnt trust any players from his team other than Hily? And Hily said he doesnt want to know and supposedly still doesnt know.   So you are telling me Upset told someone from another team but didnt trust his own teammates?   Even if I think what Adam did was dumb and immature this is just bad on both sides.
hm8rn3x,Head_Haunter,11/26/2021,1,165.0,Your sentence doesnt make a lot of sense.   Tyler1 got stuck at Gold 1 for a long time when he was doing his top climb. If he had used a previously challenger account he would have pretty easily skipped most of low elo.   Reason he did that is to prove that he could. Hes literally the only streamer that does a fresh account -> challenger challenge.
hm7oliv,vegeful,11/26/2021,1,,1 week later and league player still cant tell a different between a normal job 9-5 and an esport job. U can miss out for 1 week in the job for emergency meeting and not a single one of your co-worker get fired and your company become a clown.    There is a degree of importance between missing out on daily job and missing out on a job that require u to be there once a year or probably only once a lifetime.   Its like collecting all 7 of super dragon ball by accident and then ur friend steal ur wish then fkin Shenron gone that the level of frustration Adam feel.

hm8bza5,1000baby,11/26/2021,1,4.0,I think this is a brilliant change for both teams.   Zoom has always been more of a tank type of player with good map awareness and lane management. I think it fits perfectly well with the more aggressive mid/bot focus of TES. While JDG lacks hard carries. 369 definitely plays more similarly to how TheShy plays for IG.
hm86kwy,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,92.0,relative to the TOP of the ladder Tyler1 I dont think he is near the top. I do think Tyler1 is probably the hardest grinder of anyone to ever exist during my time of playing that I know of. I have huge respects for his grind. The best player on the server question is really hard we dont have any like god sent multi role talents like other regions do. Im not sure.

hm6yr8b,bynature123,11/26/2021,1,3.0,The new support about “money” and the ADC were pulled from Arcane and do not relate to Arcane characters anymore. It says in the roadmap above they didn’t quite fit so they’re being pushed back to 2022 and will have their own releases and stories to tell. This means everything about Arcane is off the tables Corina Veraza could certainly become a champ but I highly doubt she’s our cash goblin.   Also I think there was a leak involving Corina on the Chinese wild rift patch I think Corina is going to become the first ever exclusive wild rift champion I could be wrong but that’s what I read from a few different leaks.   The final thing that keeps me from believing this is we already have a plant support champ named Zyra and she’s doing very well this year growing in popularity. I doubt riot would put another plant champ in the support role (all 3 of them are supports) I think it would be a lot smarter if they made a mid laner or top laner out of Corina or even a poisonous jungler.

hm7ox7g,firechaox,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Right because Adam has no rights to talk about his situation to his fans. Forgot that upset is the only person here with rights and Adam isnt a public person allowed to engage with people... upset to some degree yes did lose some right to privacy indeed- and so did his girlfriend by the way given that they both literally make a living from being public figures and interacting with them. Adam didnt say anything that wasnt to some degree public knowledge or already rumored and what he says is that he wasnt given any particular reason only a vague reason that he doesnt think is what happened (that upset left merely because his girlfriend was supposedly sad) but that until he hears something better it is What he will go with I guess.   He even has a surprising amount of perspective and he cites the reason he ultimately left was that he they were trying to replace him and didnt feel valued in comms ... seems super valid for someone to leave if he doesnt feel valued.

hm804sc,Odd_Play_5769,11/26/2021,1,6.0,Its clearly Singed but there is more debate whether Vander will end up being WW or not
hm70odm,Bhiggsb,11/26/2021,1,22.0,Yea super weird. Inspired had just extended his rogue contract to 2023 back in August and look what his situation is now.
hm79gk1,Falsus,11/26/2021,1,144.0,Playing on both. Diamond on EUW and Gold on EUNE. A gold in EUNE is kinda equal to a gold in EUW but matchmaking is a bit more wild in EUNE so you get less balanced teams.
hm7a5nk,ApplePitou,11/26/2021,1,6.0,Arcane still have unimaginable potential to surprise us :3
hm79fae,ye1l,11/26/2021,1,74.0,RNG has giga money problems. Doubt that a big upgrade is actually gonna happen.
hm8czzx,Hrkeol,11/26/2021,1,180.0,He never said he isnt one of the best in NA tho or that he doesnt deserve to be on NA team so whats the point of your comment?
hm7lz1s,AsahiMizunoThighs,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,True but ymmv on how much you view League players as celebrities and being a celebrity doesnt make invasion of privacy acceptable. We can do better imo : /
hm8gyuo,Lahoje,11/26/2021,1,1516.0,You cant see it but you can assume that the noise you hear a bit before the explosion is the grenade hitting the wall because of Ekko kicking it
hm7dsqa,-LostInCloud-,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,The point is that Upset is to decide who he wants to share these things with. He did share with Yamato he would have shared with Hylli.  I guess he was right not to share with Adam and Bwipo
hm81ohv,Mejalu,11/26/2021,1,11.0,If you q up and press find match play the game. Thats what Im saying. Positive attitude isnt going to hinder your performance.   Your negative attitude and your I cant do anything about it attitude attributes to the toxicity that is prevalent in this game.
hm773ie,blueragemage,11/26/2021,1,22.0,yeah theres a chance TL got paid money to hold Alphari for a year depending on Alpharis yearly salary and buyout
hm77o5p,SP3EDI,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,dont tell lies. he never tried to replace anyone. Thats bullshit the french idiots want you to believe on social media like it was a top 10 anime betrayal. Perkz and Alphari where comming back as duo to EU and basically all top Teams where offered the duo so was fnatic and fnatic/alpahri contacted upset (alpharis old teammate) to talk to him about the stuff. Nothing out of the odinary and the very basic between every player move in the fucking league. Nisqy wanted out himself he wanted to go to c9 but c9 bailed out and no one else wants nisqy. Fnatic chose to upgrade mid with humanoid and again no one with a brain would not pick humanoid over nisqy. It has absolutly nothing to do with upset.
hm7npa0,Quaiche,11/26/2021,1,144.0,In addition of all of the other stuff he may have very wrong fundamentals of this game.  One example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fC1GHVET_s
hm7larb,GutsWay,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,I dont think youve ever competed or done something that gives your life purpose and meaning for you to call a pro player immature for caring about the thing theyve devoted their entire existence towards.  They deserved to know why their goals and hardwork were nullified. Its fair for them to want to know the exact reason. A serious family issue can mean anything. All he had to do was specify hey guys I need to be with my family at this time because Im mourning the loss of a loved one etc. Instead you decide to say absolutely nothing. I know youre a silver/gold LoL redditor but dont insult peoples dreams and hardwork.
hm7tuhv,LakersLAQ,11/26/2021,1,89.0,He probably still is tbh. TL wanting a better player is probably what lowered his value but he is still super valuable due to him not counting as an import. Hes still one of the better top laners to have if you want a championship contending roster.
hm7mzax,Judgejudyx,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,upset said he wanted alphari over adam thats not made up. im not talking about french social media
hm8pqrt,Zeddit_B,11/26/2021,1,8.0,No. Its only camps you see. Its definitely helpful but doesnt break tos.
hm7mdlg,Miyaor,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,He didnt tell them enough.  Its one thing to tell them like how I did in the first bit you need to give some information and 3 member of FNC didnt get enough. Adam and Nisqy (based on Nisqy liking Adams tweet) and Bwipo (based on him literally saying he didnt know) didnt know enough. All three didnt think it was serious enough to warrant him leaving based on what they knew.   He needed to convey how serious it was. He didnt. The way you say things matters and if three members all feel similarly about it it wasnt just one person misunderstanding. It was one person not giving them the bare minimum of information.  Even if you think Adam is a shit person you think Nisqy as well? Bwipo too? Nah he didnt convey the message properly and betrayed his teammates due to that.   I am not pissed I just feel strongly about this. I quite literally do not care if Upsets father was the ringleader behind 9/11. I just feel strongly about the situation because I have been in two similar situations one where the teammate apologized properly. The sense of betrayal you feel from a teammate ditching you is very very high and not something I would wish for anyone to feel. The time my teammate properly conveyed his feelings sucked but we are still close and all of us on the team never held it against him.  The thing Adam gets from knowing more is Closure. Closure is important for EVERYONE not just Upset. Upset wasnt the only one who was impacted by this but he only thought about himself and his friend on the team.

hm7m1kq,FaeeLOL,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,If he doesnt want to tell that is his choice. But that choice comes with the negatives of speculation. Also Adam complained about not knowing the reason. I cant believe I have to say this but *he would not be complaining about not knowing the reason if he was given the reason*.  Your job and a 5-man incredibly hard-working team environment are entirely different things. Cant even be compared. Im not sure if you realize it but we are not just talking about taking a day off from work here. Surely you understand how fucking ridiculously different the situations are so please just stop trying to draw that comparison.
hm7sds8,DeeWongsta,11/26/2021,1,253.0,Ye that’s fair. I can understand that. I’ve liked jinx from the beginning her personality and character design. Then Arcane came out and revealed she had a tragic childhood which resulted in how she is now. It makes sense completely understand how she went from Powder to Jinx buuut I would have liked jinx more if they revealed her as always being crazy instead of giving her a tragic past. It reflects real life too much which to me personally is not as interesting. I do get that people don’t just become crazy out of nowhere but Jinx isn’t a real person and so she wouldn’t NEED to have a reasonable explanation as to why she is the way she is. I tend to be drawn towards the crazy/psychotic characters but as soon as their life starts to reflect real life I lose a bit of interest in them I guess ?  I’ve had this discussion with friends and they all  disagree/ think my opinion makes no sense. I think the majority have the same opinions as my friends so it was refreshing to read your comment :)
hm8tpn9,Terozu,11/26/2021,1,56.0,Yeah How about a drink.  I dont want that drink.
hm8m56b,SnooWoofers5193,11/26/2021,1,124.0,I played with a eve one trick one time randomly in flex queue. Masters player 65% wr on 200 games #2 eve NA. Always wondered if he was a smurf. https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Last+Darkling
hm7ds9o,Grothas,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,No its not fine to think hes a weasel thats a pretty shitty thing to think and express. Were not talking his own privacy/secrets but those of a third party (his family).
hm7oyp1,No_Principle_4593,11/26/2021,1,,We are talking about the whole situation which is a big shit show one again and an other systemic failure from fnc management Professionnal esport teams are businesses and should be managed that way not like a non profit team of doctors in a public hosoital Also do you not understand my point that following how health system is managed is a pretty bad idea for a business especially considering the health system in question is a relative failure compared to its direct neighbours?

hm7a80v,bondsmatthew,11/26/2021,1,4.0,Different champions is what it comes down to. I wish they would clean up a lot of inconsistencies in league it would be pretty nice
hm801wm,puberty1,11/26/2021,1,3.0,according to leaguepedia former EG Prodigies toplaner perhaps he will be in an academy roster or is the amateur player CoreJJ talked about
hm81j93,sukableet,11/26/2021,1,277.0,That would be 100k/(32^7) = 0.00000291038 or one in 343597. This is definitely a very rough estimation for the reasons you mentioned and I would argue someone that is taking those into account could put up a much better guess than a purely random one. Anyway it definitely is rare which does make it quite a funny coincidence.

hm6yizw,Agitated-Lab6992,11/26/2021,1,276.0,League is already a literal tower defense game.

hm7mwga,DT-Z0mby,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,its debatable whether hyli or upset was the best player on that roster. there are arguments for either and i respect both sides. lets say both were the best part of the team
hm7iccm,Jiffyyy,11/26/2021,1,74.0,and that is fine. I dont think you are understanding that your way of doing this is not the golden standard of how every single person on earth handles things.
hm722d8,blueberry__wine,11/26/2021,1,24.0,Your math just isnt right ....... its not even close lmao.   but even aside from the math you dont balance champions around how fast they can 100-0 you.   Leblanc can 100-0 Vayne in 0.5 seconds. Does that mean shes 10 times more OP than Vayne is currently?
hm8gey7,doglop,11/26/2021,1,11.0,Thats just an example its like saying a marksman should be able to use ap items at their max potential. Brusier can use thornmail just not as effective as tanks easy as that

hm7un96,derbyt,11/26/2021,1,17.0,Youre relying a lot on your teammates being good enough to capitalize on advantages you give them as support (vision pressure peel lockdown). That simply doesnt happen in lower ranks. Once you get high Plat and higher Support gets easier. Im sure for someone like Dopa who rockets to those high ranks its an easier role. Personally I play a carry role until I get up to those ranks then return to being a support main.
hm8k33m,crawwurm,11/26/2021,1,78.0,so what just dye hear and put wraps on hands? zzz
hm7wdiz,Free-Pop4661,11/26/2021,1,7.0,It seems to me that you are probably in low Eli. As a support main you are better off with someone getting the kill then them getting away
hm8jc60,FatPigsExtreme,11/26/2021,1,174.0,One of my friends was stuck in bronze 4/5 for 4 years. One day one of of my other friends (who is a diamond master yi main) started teaching him how to play master yi. He started climbing pretty quickly and eventually hit gold. This made me realise that improvement is possible for people stuck in very low elo for a long time but they often don’t care/can’t be bothered to put in the effort.
hm796q7,YeastBender,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,I mean Adam mentioned that in his twitlonger but Upset said it was a straight out lie. So one of the two is lying but we dont know which one.

hm6yo2u,Judgejudyx,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,I have no issue with family emergencies. My issue as an unbiased na fan. Is that after he left worlds even for a good reason. He tried to replace adam/nisqy. Even if I had no choice and had to leave worlds. I would feel so guilty for my teamates. I wouldnt try to replace my mid and top who performed great.
hm7ufse,GarryTheCarry,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,He offered to tell him but he trusted him and respected his privacy

hm7k0x9,computo2000,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,> the community is fine to think he’s being a weasel for not telling them  Thats the most dumb take imo. Something awful happened i gotta go What happened I cant tell you because I dont want this info on social media youre lying lmao  Have you ever learned when an argument is properly supported? Because this isnt it. This is one problem. A second problem is if Upset was a liar why didnt he lie about the reason he is leaving?  Like Upset an elite level player after having reached worlds and having played the game for years and having never suddenly left his team had to leave his team because of a traumatic family event and he was extremely selective about sharing its nature because he doesnt want people on social media to use it against him. Why not believe this? Where is the logical inconsistency? That nisqy/adam dont buy it? Well how about they come out with ARGUMENTS to support their opinions I dont give a shit what they think if they dont properly support it and neither should you.
hm86c1g,jetskimanatee,11/26/2021,1,143.0,i got more down votes for saying ghost is a mediocre lck player than this guy going after upsets wife. what a joke
hm7v124,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,17.0,In challenger support is probably one of the easiest roles to climb in mainly because you have so much impact on the map without actually having any sort of gold. Supports in general are less mechanically skilled so it definitely something I would agree with Dopa on.      When it comes to climbing support for me had the least amount of agency. Being a support that is significantly better than everyone else in the game is not going to have as much of an impact when comparing it to any other role. The support role at the end of the day still plays its part as a side character that supports someone else to carry the game. Top island role ad often dictated by support and jungle mid dictated by jungle and jungle can play freely in lower ranks.
hm7q9yg,Broken_Reality,11/26/2021,1,4461.0,Would you tell someone you worked with for only a few months the details of a family crisis? Especially if they are immature? Adam was told all he needed and was entitled to know and yet he wants more? Adam has since shown that if he was told more he would have spilled it to everyone just cause he was pissed and entitled. Upset was right not to tell him anything.

hm7d8f5,jaguar317,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,I do agree that hopefully Upset has spoken to Adam behind closed doors. However these statements from Upset  are not directed to Adam anymore. He doesnt mention Adam at all in this post. Its directed to the massive amounts of hate Upset and his family are getting from the floodgates that Adam unleashed. Unfortunately that is the basically irreversible consequence of Adams actions.

hm8my4p,_HotSoup,11/26/2021,1,,This is just straight up false.  The better way to phrase it would be to say people dont care about NA talent when a roster seems to be thrown together at random without a competent coaching staff behind them and without any guidance or resources put into them. Or when the players are used as a bandaid fix to an already imploding team.   So many people are hyped about EGs roster this year. EG is a team with an extremely competent coaching staff veteran voices and leaders along with 2 young NA players and Vulcan.  If youre going to do it right I care a lot about NA players. Im so tired of people cherry-picking examples of bottom tier orgs with seemingly no idea of how to run a LoL team and using that as the example of NA talent not being good enough or people not actually wanting to watch NA players.
hm7z8o3,MrDrugnut,11/26/2021,1,11.0,the game isnt that hard to solve the higher elo you are. games become predictable assuming all 10 players arent going to be doing basic mistakes. i wouldnt say lost at draft but once the snowball gets going its pretty obvious. I mean they had to implement this bounty system to try and fix that issue and its still pretty bad assuming the winning team is just taking the objectives  you could say you are assuming a lot but throws rarely happen. hard to throw in a gamestate where you either one shot or overheal long gone are the days of slowpaced macro plays and creative teamfights - there is no way to make a proper mistake if the game boils down to stat checking. and the point is that we rather make 9/10 games go quicker than to fight for nothing because of the 1/10 being an example of aNyThIng CaN hAppEn  stop watching anime. sheer force of will isnt going to make the enemy mid unplug their ethernet cable. they will keep roaming and snowballing lanes and no amount of positive attitude is going to change that.

hm75n6n,PowerfulRice5704,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Upset is under no obligation to tell his teammates the specifics of the situation. Them knowing his mother died or his wife miscarrying or whatever it might be doesnt change the situation of the matter. Upset placed his family above his playing a video game and that is a decision I will always support and we should all respect his privacy. Bwipow cheating on his gf or however he hurt her and airing his dirty laundry to the public was his own decision. Adam being annoyed at not knowing the situation is a feeling he is entitled to. Upsets situation is still none of their business.

And given that Youngbuck was an actual person in charge for FNC while Grabbz was more of an assistant to the G2 players its really not that weird to put YB over Grabbz
hm7gbbm,Jazdu,11/26/2021,1,1301.0,Dont want to throw hate at all but when Perkzs dad died we all knew why he wasnt playing (a very important reason) and when Doublelifts brother did what he did (extremely important situation) we all knew .  I wonder what the fuck happened to Upset family to top those 2 situations.
hm6xsvn,maribri6,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Adam only wrote that because he wasnt trusted with anything and no one would tell him anything after the fact.  Its like a firefighter not putting out a fire and justifying it after by saying everything burned. Well yeah everything burned cause they didnt put it out.  In IRL sport you kinda abandon your privacy towards your teammates why? cause trust means telling people things. Not hiding it from them. Im not saying thats how it should be Im saying thats how it is.  Upset didnt wanna tell his teammates what was the problem therefore  the situation became super complicated for him and FNC management to explain to the others in the team. Especially cause you have hard time trusting someone who just said they didnt trust you enough to tell you things.  IMO the reactions weve seen show that FNC management were not able to handle the situation at all.

hm8jyho,V1pArzZ,11/26/2021,1,174.0,85 cs/ min and 3 deaths avg is pretty hard to achieve. Get it on kayle and i suppose youll end up pretty high.

hm7pjar,uncertainrandompal,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,that’s right. funny how hard to do any business with immature kids like him.   orgs have nerves of steel to deal with all of this
hm7fc4j,Fgame,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,The amount of manchildren downvoting me because theyve never had to take care of a family before is honestly staggering. Like everyone on the team is entitled to the personal medical information here? You dont understand how the REAL world works this would never fly in the REAL world! But Im pretty sure at the OLYMPICS this year Team USA had a gymnast step down due to mental issues. And thats a MUCH bigger deal than worlds.

hm7w6ot,ArrayyLoL,11/26/2021,1,3.0,Most of the times it doesnt matter. What matters is the enemy is dead and he is losing XP and gold every second. It matters only when ur damage carry (wether it is the karma or the ziggs) is behind and enemy has a shutdown.
hm6z6an,SevenTailedFox,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,My thoughts exactly. As many others have already said Upset has a right to keep his privacy and Adam has a right to be frustrated/angry with the situation. However its extremely unprofessional of Adam to vent on Twitter like that. He can be mad at Upset all he wants but making shit like this public is absurd and harmful.
hm7qixv,vegeful,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,You mean those random nobody on twitter with fake name with zero like or the twitch people who get banned?

hm7tguj,vegeful,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Imagine that u still cant tell a different between normal job and pro player job after he give a simple detail.   Its not childish when people career will be gone after this. Proper explaination for absent is a given. Both Fnatic management and Upset fail to deliver a message that can make his team understand the severity of what Upset is facing.  If u cant understand it that ok.   Moreover I dont like both of them but i can understand Adam feeling more. Also another FNC management fail in their duty this tweet had last for 3 day now? Why no one in FNC say anything to counter Adam but outsider come and help Upset like they know more about it.
hm7ex1l,InvitemetoSkeet,11/26/2021,1,64.0,Its like the same winrate with lethal on draven.  What are you looking at?  [https://u.gg/lol/champions/draven/runes-table](https://u.gg/lol/champions/draven/runes-table)  Conq wr increases with rank.

hm7v29r,MapPotential9009,11/26/2021,1,243.0,Yes because its true
hm79d11,AutofilledLux,11/26/2021,1,1620.0,hello do now support and adc of 2021. that will be released in 2022. count as champions for support and bottom role of 2022. or 2021.? since you said in previous roadmaps that you aim for 1 champion per position. so does that mean that we would still get another support and adc in 2022. besides the delayed ones cause of Arcane?
hm7tsa8,TH3RM4L33,11/26/2021,1,120.0,That hasnt been the case for years. His damage level 2 is laughable right now.
hm7d2rk,Jonoabbo,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,So what? You want him to lie and go Nah I think Adam is a better for the team than Alphari or Wunder?

hm7muha,c9haiondrugs,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,How is it pathetic? He not only abandoned him for cloudy reason thats can be respected but after doing so he talked down on him and tried to get rid of him from the roster? Imagine someone misses work beacuse of an emergency so you pick up their slack for the next 2 weeks and when they return they want to replace you.  &#x200B  Petty is a matter of perspective.
hm75s50,supern00b64,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Maybe his wife pushed him to play league with her to cheer him up. Do you really think that he would or his family would let him just wallow in misery for the whole time he was home?
hm780op,thenicob,11/26/2021,1,83.0,I see what hes implying: the quality of the camera joke edit was way worse than modern cameras are. I also felt like the editing of the video was pretty meh. BDS had much better videos (see the Xico one). sound was really meh in the interview section.
hm7au8m,nitko87,11/26/2021,1,115.0,Your friend is unfortunately not playing the game in a way that is conducive to long term improvement. He might very well be trying to win every single game and when you play like that it is horribly frustrating to lose. I used to play ranked that way and it just wasn’t fun I wasn’t going anywhere and it felt like games were out of my control.  What your friend needs to do if he really wants to improve is stop trying to win and start trying to improve. Victory will follow once he actually gets better at the game.   It’s interesting. I play a lot of norms because usually I just hit gold and stop playing ranked so I see a good amount of the low elo ladder in my games. You can ALWAYS tell who’s Silver 4 or lower simply by how they play. I’d go so far as to say that people who belong in higher elo can easily get to the rank they deserve. But “Career Bronze” players (as I call them) play like you’d expect bronze players to play either because they’re truly bad at the game or they are like your friend and refuse to improve.  I’d urge your friend to do the following if they truly want to improve (some of this may be stuff they already do idk).  Drop the ego. Your friend is literally bronze. Bottom 15% or lower. He’s not good. His teammates aren’t the only reason he isn’t improving.   Stick to one main role 3 champions in that role. Learn 1-2 champ/ for their offrole  Don’t expect to win if you’re not above 7.5cs/min all game   Practice dying as few times as possible (while still going for smart plays)  Watch how pros play the game (wards roaming taking objectives etc)  Mute all every game.   Play the game as if you’re against 5 AI and with 4 on your team +you. It’s your job to win the game no one else’s. That doesn’t mean someone else might not carry and that doesn’t mean every game is winnable but you need to overperform every game to improve.  Similarly even if the game is lost do not lose focus and start playing “badly”. Continue to farm continue to look for advantages that could get you back in the game. Practice playing from behind.   If your friend tries this stuff and still can’t get better at league idk. Might be a lost cause. I have a buddy who is Silver 3 with like 600 games this season who’s got a similar issue. He’s admittedly an okay player but he still tries to play like 40 different champs has a bad mental and there’s a clear reason he never hit gold despite having the mechanics to do it.

hm8pz2a,Mejalu,11/26/2021,1,26.0,Bro the point since season 3 has been to win the game and sweat as you call it. Snowball was far worse then than it is now.   Playing the game until the Nexus blows up is what you agreed to do when you clicked find match. Not only try if its going good for me. If thats the case then why even play league of legends. There are plenty of other games where you can completely avoid this.
hm7doox,Horizon96,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,Because the German Spanish Swedish Norwegian Dutch and so on all learned English and it makes for an easy way for everyone to communicate. I get your point but realistically a person cant learn every European language and English tends to be the common ground for most Europeans.

hm8nypc,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,165.0,rakan will always be a champion that engages in mid ~ late game. He can sometimes just go for the enemy flank and 1 man ult him vs trying to get a big ult on their 4. In lane he can play as an enchanter poke engage or sustain. I had the most success when I had a lot of divers on my team. The beauty about rakan is that hes so versatile in lane and can impact the map at the same time.

hm8rrda,Prinz_,11/26/2021,1,2.0,Yeah so many shows these days use other peoples music. And it works really well to be fair - but when you have music crafted to the scene like how Riot does with Arcane or even when the scene is influenced by the music itself (I think they mentioned that was a factor in the /dev) it really does hit different.
hm8pm9z,Mejalu,11/26/2021,1,26.0,I really cant believe that you are telling me that its ok to give up in a game that you chose to play and then making a case for it like its not a majority cause for a lot of the toxicity in this game.   Whether youre losing or winning play the game. I dont get the point if youre not going to play. What do you play the game for?   Do you just play the game for lp? What kind of emptiness is that
hm7e69h,jaguar317,11/26/2021,1,,Adam can say what he wants. Nobody is stopping him. No one is arresting him for his tweet. Unfortunately that doesnt make it not a dick move.
hm7bqxc,jaguar317,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,You do realize that if Upset were to tell Adam the full details he would be sharing someone elses private struggle with Adam has absolutely nothing to do with that person right?   I do feel bad for Upsets teammates and I understand their frustration. But I think two things are very clear. First publicly bashing and sending massive waves of hate towards Upset is 100% the wrong move. Second there is no way Upset is obligated to share someone elses situation with Adam who he isnt very close to and who certainly isnt at all connected with the person who is close to Upset.
hm79gew,Melodias07,11/26/2021,1,84.0,TBH canna > Zeus now we didnt saw much from Zeus and he didnt look that great.  Might change if he get enough stage experience with the team.

hm7rfmg,DangerousSeaweed0,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,ure kidding. messing with someones work and livelyhood is probably the least proffesional donezo manifests we ever got in league. its a legitimate reason to be pissed at considering how short esports careers are.  adam was kicked out of 1 of 2 western teams that actually have a chance at doing anything internationally  and he was kicked for a player he clowed on in their series....as a rookie with a lot more potential to grow.  thats a slap on the face for him  even more so when the decision had upsets involvement after he absoultly bailed on them and had the audacity to tell them face to face that he doesnt trust them or that hes not up to his standards.  that situation alone would be enough to break the team  without including the worlds fiasco in it. If u think that was unproffesional from adam  what do u call upsets behaviour ?

hm7s076,IWouldLikeAName,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Yes. I do in fact mean the trolls how could you tell? Who says it doesnt make a difference. It can still heavily impact a person. Performance can be controlled and is usually on you. Something like a personal emergency is out of your control and can make you feel helpless. Having random trolls making fun of your parents death and that your brother that you loved and looked up to was the cause will still sting especially when DL was finally starting to make amends with his parents.   Why even have a chance at being harassed by trolls when you can just keep the matter to your inner circle.
hm7nnpt,FearMyFPS,11/26/2021,1,551.0,I mean Riot asked AzirMains this and the overwhelming answer was Shurima Shuffle and so now we’re stuck with this

hm8l7p7,Random_Stealth_Ward,11/26/2021,1,17.0,Wanted? Probably not exactly but they arent intended to be the main users as chainsaw does exists and lets them apply grievous easier. Bruisers are supposed to use tank items to some extent but they are not necessarily the class they are balanced on much like DMP was mainly a bruiser item despite having tank stats and so it was balanced around bruisers.  Thornmail is mainly balanced as a tank item and so its no surprise the better users will be tanks. This is a similar situation to old Sunfire with the CC proc of damage that was added sure some bruisers could want to use Sunfire but the item was mainly catered towards tanks so the proc was mainly going to help them more than bruisers. Only real loser of this situation is Mundo since tank items that need CC procs arent as good on him and bruiser items arent necessarily good on him either.

And the reason Ive not engaged with you specifically as youll note there are plenty of others Ive been more than happy to go back and forth with is because of how youve presented yourself. Not as someone looking to have a discussion or debate but as a pseudo intellectual who smells an opportunity to assert dominance but now cant account for his false conjecture. Not only do know how I feel about the show as a whole its obvious to you the character flaws that lead me to those incorrect assertions. Objectivity and conjecture do not go hand in hand quite the opposite actually. And you dont even realize that that is your real problem. Its not that hate is the wrong word to describe how youve extrapolated I must feel about the subject its the fact that you think you know that in the first place. This is what you have to take into consideration if you want to be taken seriously in a debate as someone with validity to their contribution. Though Im not quite sure thats what you really care about as you strike me as someone just out to make themselves feel or look superior. Do I know that? No. I have no idea what kind of person you are nor your motivations for continuing a conversation that has clearly upset you. And thats the type of objectivity you lack which makes you pointless to engage with. Or as a wise man once said a waste of time. You dont know how to argue you know how to reddit argue. Which you are pretty adept at but nonetheless.
hm877op,bns18js,11/26/2021,1,92.0,> Every role has harder and easier champions support has few extremely high skill cap ones but that doesnt make the average player much different.  The hardest support champs are easier than the hardest champs in other roles. The average support champs are also easier than the average support champs in other roles.   And its not only champion kits either. What you have to do in your role also matters alot. A xerath played in the mid lane is harder than a xerath played in the support position even if theyre literally the same champion. Having to contest/get every CS while also aiming your skillshots is much harder than just aiming your skillshots.  >Seraphine is all skillshots apart from a high CD shield obviously more to keep track of than Annie or twisted fate even.  In insolation if you ONLY talk about spells sure. But have you seen a challenger twisted fate lane? Its alot of very precise mouse movements much much harder than what a challenger seraphine has to do in lane.   Also skillshots is like the worst argument lmao. Vayne for example has zero but nobody is insane enough to call her easier than seraphine. Because obviously vayne needs so much more mouse precision/speed and reflex to properly kite and do damage while seraphine can sit miles back with low APM and still get alot of value out by throwing out some easy spells in peoples general direction.  >But because one is a support role (and frankly because one is a cute aesthetic character) its considered mechanically easy by people who have never played the role.  I explained why above. Also again youre **ignoring** the fact that support is the least popular role and what casuals gravitate towards making it the role with the least amount of competition.  >It only becomes a gap in role skill in extremely few picks like Akali or azir but 99.999% of the people calling support easy cant play those champion at a master+ level either  And 99.999% of support players would drop a shit ton of elo if they played anything else. While other roles switching to support can stay even or even climb.

hm7h46j,PoachedByCarlos,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,Because Adam wouldnt have come out with the accusations and this wouldnt have blown up so much
hm8q5we,mikharv31,11/26/2021,1,26.0,Well they fielded “somebodies” last year and look where that got them lmao

hm84gbv,RegalSkye,11/26/2021,1,291.0,Oh man I feel you. Its not everyday you meet another JP server refugee. Its the negative atmosphere of the KR server without the quality of gameplay and its made worse by the sheer number of Korean/Chinese/Vietnamese invaders. Queue times were god awful and while I was still there I ended up playing only TFT.
hm82h23,LazerFruit,11/26/2021,1,7.0,Ideally ziggs should but its much better for the supp to get it then it is to try and gift it and pantheon walk away

hm8541y,PhreakRiot,11/26/2021,1,92.0,Ironically support has your highest winrate and fewest games while jungle has your lowest winrate. Caveat that jungle went 200 lp higher but Support seemed to actually be your easiest climb by results.
hm7okww,adek13sz,11/26/2021,1,252.0,That would be glorious. French/Spanish people vs Polish people.

hm7k0pp,ACertainUser123,11/26/2021,1,92.0,Well Adams situation is worse than the others he also had upset go behind his back and talk to Fnatic about replacing him with alphari. So its like he stabbed adam in the back twice so i get why hes really annoyed at upset. But yea he shouldnt have speculated about his situation.
hm77a87,KasumiGotoTriss,11/26/2021,1,24.0,>she can stack it and one-shot people before its possible to react  ?? How do you not have the time to react? She cant stack it on minions
hm76j16,kazuyaminegishi,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Upset stated that when asked what he thought about Alphari vs Adam he said he felt Alphari was the better player. He also went on to elaborate by saying he feels its normal to try and build the best team possible.  He doesnt owe Adam anything other than an apology for ruining their worlds which I hope he did give them. Anything after that is assigning some debt to Upset that he doesnt have.
hm7grev,Xyexs,11/26/2021,1,184.0,Wait what the fuck is there proof of this?
hm703jg,HawksFanKennesaw,11/26/2021,1,2.0,Well hopefully yall can make up for the last several years of CLG being terrible.  Nothing easy.

hm6yt9g,Metaxpro,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,>I mean... nothing wrong with selling her nudes if she wants to.     Yes Im sure theres nothing wrong with being married to someone that others can just google up for their naked body she was selling so easily like it was street hotdog. Does absolutely nothing to either ones mental and has no effect on a relationship dynamic.   Downvote all you want because its the age of empowering women no matter what they do but this shit can ruin peoples lives and by the time they actually realize that its already too late.
hm7rz0i,Iperovic,11/26/2021,1,89.0,Why though?  And I mean why for both parties?  Im assuming these players werent cheap plus they take up import slots so if things dont work out in any direction it will be a fucking nightmare
hm7r9zr,ConscienceNot,11/26/2021,1,15.0,I tried to beat him as panthen with full mythic item and he literally had just tabis. I couldnt beat him even when he started at 50% of HP.
hm75inm,DrawDecoder,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Upset probably thought he was being transparent but in reality didn’t communicate it well with his teammates at all.  If multiple FNC players feel slighted by Upset then it really does bring into question the way Upset himself has handled this situation legitimate as his issues may be.
hm7etqa,Mortally_DIvine,11/26/2021,1,68.0,Why does the backflip bug happen if you have some insight?

hm7n2bv,DangerousSeaweed0,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,how would adam know whats beingg normal  with him being a rookie for one ?  and even if its normal  it still feels like shit when the teammate that bailed on you is also the one saying yea  i think we can replace him with a better player  since my dream is to win  Like...no shit  u think adams dream was to get shit on because his team lost their main carry 12h before the first game?
hm8o0jr,Careless_Scheme_1189,11/26/2021,1,28.0,Would love to see xayah rakan have some screen time

Which is literally what 3/4 members did (although Adam had different reasons but it didnt help and nisqy also doesnt seem happy with it).

hm7fmc9,Adleyy65,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,They dont deserve anything besides knowing that Upset had an important family incident. They dont need to know more and also dont deserve to know more. Or how would you feel if you had share some of your most private matters with your colleagues at work who you know for a few months. FNC Management knows it and thats enough.
hm7ev5o,whydoyoureadnames,11/26/2021,1,97.0,Gamergate is funny in the moment to moment understanding and play by play but as you said the long term effects it had were devastating. Steve bannon even directly cited gamergate when he began his political moves. It’s so fucked.
hm73f7a,MCGabbaG,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,I 100% agree. The fact that only Adam feels like he has to vent about this publicly kinda shows for me that he is the least mature of the players. Probably thinks he can say anything he wants now because of the massive French fanbase. Kinda scary tbh.
hm8bccc,IWillNameMyChildZoe,11/26/2021,1,7.0,Collector has to go. This item is too cancer to exist.
hm7x0yd,vegeful,11/26/2021,1,1589.0,He is a public figure. Him vented in private to his friend does not mean shit because tommorow many insider will say in twitter that he dislike Upset behaviour.

hm7qrrw,usernameisavailable2,11/26/2021,1,148.0,I think the best usage of this is when youre playing morgana against say a blitz. With self cast you can hover ur mouse over ur ally and should the blitz hook come flying towards you you dont have to reposition ur mouse back to yourself before casting black shield.
hm7fkjw,GarryTheCarry,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,Because they cant understand that he doesnt know them good enough to tell them something that private  He knows Hyli and trusts him not to go public with it thats why he was ready to tell him and Hyli trusting him and Adam going public just proves that he knows who is his friend and who is just coworker
hm7l3cd,Elibu,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Very doubtful he just left like that.
hm7m07y,OppaiTaichou,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,yeah if its done behind his back its just backstabbing lol. could of just told him they dont plan to play with him next year or that they dont want to play with him.      its not that hard to be upfront with your current teammates.
hm89k8e,RyanGreenOnMyCock,11/26/2021,1,298.0,This is actually valid lol most Canadians live south of Detroit
hm8dmti,terenul1,11/26/2021,1,44.0,Theoretically in most cases you beat her in lane and sniwball the lead in a win. But there is so much gold in the game that its basically guaranteed for any vayne to get 3 items and start running whole teams down
hm7zbv8,Salm9n,11/26/2021,1,55.0,Last hitting in a vacuum is easy for anyone with a brain but the hard part is getting the cs while trading.   Your second points rings true but I’ve also seen them just afk mid on support champs mid while the enemy roams and carries the game. I honestly think only tops and junglers are good at auto-fill mid lane. Elo based for sure too
hm7jbel,kill4life54,11/26/2021,1,12326.0,Aight yeah thats also a possible way for vik to get to glorious evolution 😁

hm6ytxk,dgar19949,11/26/2021,1,7.0,I think if you aren’t getting shield reduction your ganna have a bad time otherwise they are both scrub killers.
hm8iazg,JukebocksTV,11/26/2021,1,12.0,As adc if I need to choose between getting a minion or attacking the enemy and I can only do one I should take the cs every time. This only changes if there is kill potential. This can be arranged by the support stepping forward with me and attacking the enemy adc while I take the cs.  Any other distribution of responsibility in the bot lane is sub optimal.
hm8r9wi,Banglatiger,11/26/2021,1,8.0,That’s a really hard question to answer tbh. There’s too many champs and too many styles of play to really make a decision for someone else. I’d first figure out what primary role and secondary role you like first then go from there.  Once you got that down figure out if you like assassins high dps bruisers tanks supports or mages then once you got that it’ll narrow your pool significantly and then master maybe all the champs that fill that filter since it’s much smaller and learn one champ that you’re comfortable in an unfamiliar for each other filter.   For example. I love side lanes. Can’t stand jg will tolerate mid and support   For top I’ve mastered most of the fighters and a couple tanks. For bot I’ve mastered maybe 7 adcs and I have like 4 pocket picks for mid and 2 for support and 2 Jg champs I could play even if I have a bad day.
hm6yn27,RoughMedicine,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Hyli sided with him because he has some decency and realised it wasnt his place to ask if Upset didnt want to share.  Just grow up already.

Either way do you actually think “well he might be better than the two players likely to be the worst mids in the league” is a great argument for someone who has been hanging around since 2016?

hm7qxy6,akutasame94,11/26/2021,1,144.0,I am the exact same opposite rofl  Ive played with high elo and low elo. I have beat challengers numerous times in lane (Mix of friends with different skill levels so we made custom 5 v 5s).  In season 8 I decided to try and take the game seriously like literally pay attention to everything. I climbed to plat 1 in very few wins from Gold 4. I think I lost only 3 games on that climb. But then I got bored of playing same champions and holding myself back.  See I am pretty good in lane mechanically. I used to play a lot of FPS games and I am used to fast paced gameplay and needing quick reflexes so I am greeding and disrespecting everything enemy does rofl. I am like If jungler comes to my ass overextending for last 5 minutes Ill kill em both and since this is not fps I die. I also dont ward. I know I should I know where and when I just dont care.  I also cycle through champions constantly. THe only role I actually dont do that is ADC which is my main role that I dont play too much and have only started playing again to climb because  in other roles the urge to outplay is too strong.   The main difference tho is I dont really complain or care. I probably could reach diamond maybe higher or maybe Id be stuck in plat but I play the game to have fun and couldnt care less where I am ranked.
hm72xrd,Vantablack9,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,> it’s more so he felt that he didn’t have to even communicate how dire the situation was to his team  But Upset says that he spoke with the team saying that he was feeling pretty bad because of it but couldnt tell them what it was. Now do we believe Upset that he said that to everyone? Thats up to each one but its weird that people keep saying this.
hm7m1z2,Craftingistheway,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Thats simply not true. They dont have to trust Upsets judgment. THey have to trust the judgment of their fucking employeer who have gotten the information...     Like they may come as news to you but you have to trust my judgment is precisely the type of relationship you have with your god damn fucking boss...
hm89ylv,_DEKADE_,11/26/2021,1,298.0,Im not saying you are wrong but if it was that simple then there would be 1 server.  The main appeal of 2 servers is language Europe has alot of them. Yes you dint need language to ping but speaking in team chat is useful for setting up plays. The other appeal would be ping having a single server would probably affect some countries way more than others.  Im also pretty sure that merging 2 huge servers is alot harder than most people think which is fair enough not everyone is knowledgeable about that topic especially teens or young adults which are the main demographic for lol.  Imo its fine as it is. If you think you would have more fun in another server then make a new account or pay for a transfer.

hm78rzn,DieNowMike,11/26/2021,1,1.0,I think it should only trigger if all lames are behind (except maybe support because that could lead to strategic inting)
hm7rpcm,smashspete,11/26/2021,1,144.0,You just described 95% of players on League tbh. They want a higher rank but dont really care to play the game and think about what they can do to improve. Every game they play they focus on looking at how everyone else is playing to criticize it instead of just focusing on their own performance regardless of what their teammates are doing. thats literally all there is to it. its a maturity thing to be honest or lack of
hm8i6dn,Freeman0017,11/26/2021,1,12346.0,I call it for Mel here you can see her jerk a bit before the warhead armed itself as if sensing something then her adorments start to glow and she turns to see the rocket hit the window Jayce and Victor are standing just next to her and so is Kaitlyns mother so maybe Mel is able to protect them but everyone else is as good as dead
hm7isxz,HyBrideh,11/26/2021,1,5.0,If you manage to get ahead early try to transition that lead into the map. What I mean by that is to try to gank the other lanes and help your jungler secure vision and objectives. I think this is what most low elo players struggle with they always say they win their lane but lose the game and that’s because they don’t transition their lane lead into a map lead. Secure objectives and vision with your lead as well as advantages in kills and prio for your team and you’ll consistently win more games.
hm758gy,ihatemylife39,11/26/2021,1,108.0,You’re right it’s just that taking a break for a couple months and doing something else actually does help with improving mindset at least for me. I took a break from the game for one month and I went from being hardstuck silver 4 to gold 4.
hm79nuh,ApplePitou,11/26/2021,1,7.0,Nice find :3
hm7sgtg,12thBlessing,11/26/2021,1,1546.0,people downvoting you for this but for sure big personalities have discord minions that find out juicy drama through connections (employees at orgs friends on teams etc.) and relay it for attention.
hm7ygo8,CuteKnight12,11/26/2021,1,127.0,Hahaha. I wish man. It genuinely feels the same as low elo sometimes. Just with *much* bigger egos lmao  If you want to learn quickly/improve with the game I suggest watching actually high elo streamers/YouTubers (educational ones specifically)! Watching PekinWoof for example helped me improve a lot since he talks about what kind of things hes thinking/taking note of during matches.
hm7qu5p,marlgrgr,11/26/2021,1,7.0,The funny thing is that I had a similar game a couple of days ago but a little more intense:        https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/r2ydw2/when\_you\_play\_the\_fifth\_game\_of\_your\_promo\_to/        They stopped hitting the nexus not just once but twice and the third time when they tried to win they were outplayed and lost.
hm7mlvt,DT-Z0mby,11/26/2021,1,205.0,well true. we are talking about server area though and if im not wrong the vast majority of canadians live in the south rather close to the US
hm7b2vk,2poundWheel,11/26/2021,1,87.0,Im saying from watching his soloq for over a year lol
hm84u6q,NeshamahX,11/26/2021,1,107.0,Congrats bro. Its been a personal goal of mine for years as well. Its awesome to see someone else succeed!
hm8kaqx,moebelhausmann,11/26/2021,1,78.0,Weird flex... Actually iam not that jelous as long as she doesnt have the Guantlets
hm86jpc,HappyLittleLongUserN,11/26/2021,1,126.0,Zilean: Dont be mad when the game gets hard since you can always be useful. Be flexible how you aproach situations because there is more than one way to play it out and you can always adapt to the team if you need engage follow up cc peel zoning or just someone clearing the waves until the carry is done scaling. This champ has it all to be honest.
hm879fv,Tuxxmuxx,11/26/2021,1,561.0,Something similar was a thing in counter-strike source for a little while https://counterstrike.fandom.com/wiki/Dynamic_Weapon_Pricing  Guns changed prices once a week depending on how used they were over the previous week. It obviously wasnt a good idea but its interesting
hm7gb9f,xKayko,11/26/2021,1,74.0,Why are you acting like you know what happened and its the only obvious thing you weirdo.
hm74ncq,jaguar317,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,Heres the thing. If Upsets situation only included himself I could definitely have seen him telling his teammates. However his situation includes someone else who has nothing to do with Adam. Imo hes right to not spread someone elses personal struggle to random public figures who are irrelevant to their life.
hm88wtf,Zamasuningen,11/26/2021,1,110.0,they did win MSI tho
hm6yopa,CoogiMonster,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,I can sympathize with the Nisqy stuff because I actually thought during the regular season he was good and I can’t picture a replacement that’s an upgrade falling into Fnatic’s lap.  Adam was fine and a rookie and justifiably upset that he was being overlooked but you can’t not swing for a top 3 western Top lane (even if there was 0% chance of Alphari coming).  If anything seems true it’s that Fnatic and girlfriends/wives seem to have caused a lot of drama this last season and that hopefully mature discourse can happen also Hyli is a fucking chad awesome teammate/player/husband that is managing all those roles maturely… no point in him leaving since he’s th franchise player at this point.
hm7dczv,lppur3ps3,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,I dont see where Bwipo comes in?
hm8s8uy,zer0-_,11/26/2021,1,52.0,Im 99% sure he injected or consumed Shimmer in Act 3. Either beforr he was talking to Viktor or before Silco came looking for help because of Jinx
hm7uit0,pannucci,11/26/2021,1,52.0,He has since day 1 said he only wants to play with rookie. Nothing has changed. He actually has been on record saying he would retire if he didnt play with him so its actually pretty insane hes considering playing in LCK without him.
hm8hjbb,elderbob1,11/26/2021,1,2.0,looool true
hm7a9us,philip2110,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,Some people read Adam’s post and took everything he said as fact even though it is clearly not because that’s not how people act. It’s not Adam’s fault he’s a moronic kid with an insane ego who threw a sulk but it is what it is at this point.
hm8q8eg,doglop,11/26/2021,1,4.0,Eh I like wildrift but I dont like not being able to get skins even if they are random and the worst of all in pc at least thats something I like

hm8avug,Yetti2Quick,11/26/2021,1,108.0,False. This guy uses high mmr accounts to climb them from previous seasons. Tyler uses brand new fresh accounts that he literally levels up to 30 himself. He is the true alpha and will be all role challenger early next season.
hm8j4de,Arclight_Ashe,11/26/2021,1,315.0,You know you’ve pissed someone off when they go from trying to insult you in broken English to outright capslocking in their native language and expecting you to understand them.   Bonus points when you respond ‘speak English it’s English language server’ and you get 5 lines of ‘fuck your mother’ in Turkish or polish and the comment that started it off was ‘can you please ping miss’

hm8dekz,FakeBukowski,11/26/2021,1,165.0,I feel like a lot of people dont know how to auto attack. If you AA using right click on the target you are not doing it right. In my opinion the best way to auto attack is using attack move on smartcast (some people just use standard attack move though without the smartcast - I wanna say its just personal preference but it really is not you save yourself an extra click every single attack if you use the smartcast version).   It takes some time to get used to but it **will** make you better at auto attacking especially on ranged champions. If anybody is not familiar with this feel free to hit me up for further explanation as I was right clicking people for years before my eyes were opened.
hm7uv2t,pannucci,11/26/2021,1,52.0,First off just no. Smeb was also indisputably the best top laner for 2 years straight as well. So lets just get rid of that argument. Yes the gap during The Shy at his peak is higher but it was a much shorter period of time and not a flexibly style like Smeb who was the best top laner in every single meta. Tank Carry Lane Swap etc. The Shy is probably the #2 though without a doubt but really the only issue for Smeb is his lack of championships but honestly thats a pretty bullshit statistic.  &#x200B  The really only arguement against him was his start as a pro but even then now the shy has kind of matched him for bad periods as well. The rediculous thing is if not for ROX Smeb would have gone down as one of the worst top laners in history. He was a meme at the start of his career and then something happened and he was insane all of a sudden. Legit one of the best top laners in the world for 4 years straight and indisputably #1 for 2 years.

hm7pflw,phranq,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,They aren’t inciting anything. He gave his side of the story. One side is willing to share and one side isn’t. That’s the price Upset is paying for not wanting to share with his teammates why he left them.
hm8p19l,V1pArzZ,11/26/2021,1,24.0,Yeah and lillia is a slayer like yone yasuo and master yi. Riot classifications dont say much. A juggernaut is a low cc high damage tank.

hm8qew6,maidboy,11/26/2021,1,134.0,no they dont. i coach semi-professionally and i can tell you no one has a clue about the core mechanics of the game generally up until s11 euw master 500lp on servers like LAS etc no one has a clue except the very best pro players (average latin american pros are worse than your average euw/kr/cn gm player). ofc there are exceptions and ofc its not as black and white as understanding everything and being completely clueless but the game isnt played properly up until that point in terms of soloq. game quality in d1-500lp was a lot better in earlier seasons but elo inflation lowered the skill levels of all tiers. there is absolutely no reason to feel good about duo preseason dog server pisslow rank and the shiny badge shouldnt be enough to make this person post it to reddit.
hm7onq1,JamisonDouglas,11/26/2021,1,,Yeah dude this has been common knowledge for a while now. If your account is fresh (as in 0 ranked games played) and you spam normals as a 5 stack while grinding to 30 and try hard you will have stupid LP games and be able to climb like a rocket ship. Same for flex. As long as the account hasnt played ranked your games alter your MMR.    Just look up normal game MMR exploit and pick a sauce that looks to your taste theres many to choose from.

hm740kh,kazuyaminegishi,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Adam going to Upset and FNC demanding to be told the thing he was specifically told he wouldnt be told is stupid. His issue isnt that he doesnt know the specifics of why Upset left his issue is that Upset left at all. Hes not being honest with himself in that he didnt wanna play with Upset.  Upset feeling that Alphari and Perkz would be better than Adam and Nisqy isnt betrayal its how the industry works and has no correlation with Upset leaving.  Its understandable that Adam is angry but the resolutions hes looking for do not address the source of his anger. Hes angry because he doesnt like how Upset conducted himself he doesnt ask for Upset removed or an apology instead he demands the thing that he had no business knowing. Doesnt make sense.
hm76kfj,rudebrooke,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Because management and the coaching staff knew the reason and they were clearly satisfied with it. To the point where hes still on the team afterwards.
hm7u568,ConscienceNot,11/26/2021,1,15.0,Honestly as someone who plays both Jungle and Toplane sometimes you really cant do a shit and the best call is simply to not play. Well under normal circumstances you are protected by the fact that its very rarely worth it but when your jungler is imbecile and your  team as a whole cant play 4v3 then no matter how good you are at map awareness sooner or later you gonna get caught.

hm81y38,radijator22,11/26/2021,1,103.0,I am talking about they wanted to leave  They didnt want to play with larssen rge chose larssen and because of that they wanted to leave   Inspired is top2 jungler in EU and hans sama came off of monster worlds performance(and he was one of the best adcs in eu already) and org chose to stick with... larssen.  Only rational explanation was making money competing was not because if it was u drop larssen instantly and keep inspired and hans. Replacing inspired and hans is hard. Replacing a mid laner who stagnated for more than a year(apart from laning) and is a choker and a non factor in high stakes matches is a lot easier than to replace argubaly the best jungler and adc in a region
hm7bdg6,ZXKeyr324XZ,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,Eh according to rumours hes selling Wunder so anything is possible really

For fucks sake they know and they go on with Upset. We dont need to know EVERYBODY has legit PROOF Upsets situation wasnt entirely bullshit. How is that so hard to grasp?!     Also just because Adams overinflated ego thinks he is the shit it is a joke that he thinks he wasnt on the chopping block when FNC was looking at people like Humanoid and Razork...

hm84ch9,mazrrim,11/26/2021,1,,Cant take you seriously if you dont understand the role   Enchanters at a high level are much better mechanically than engage tanks that have one job to occasionally throw all their spells out. Watch how challenger Janna players lane.  On ranged auto attack supports the entire laning battle contesting cs is incredibly similar to midlane

hm7rw03,LakersLAQ,11/26/2021,1,89.0,You are able to build out some nice rosters with Impact though. He gets compensated for not taking up an import slot. Thats a big reason why he was valued so highly on TL in the first place aside from his good play.
hm8e8so,MapPotential9009,11/26/2021,1,20.0,Its not the players fault Riot has made the game so fast and snowbally comebacks are realistically not possible once defeat has set in. Mythic item power spikes and lethality assassins/bruisers are just unfun to play against if youre behind. Theres nothing wrong with accepting defeat and moving onto the next game. The worst is that one player who refuses to give up even though theyre 0/11 and your team hasnt secured and single dragon and the enemy just downed baron. Thats just as bad as giving up after first blood. Some games are unwinnable and Riots tragic matchmaking makes this even worse. You cannot blame someone for wanting to /ff if theyre having a shit time playing. Games are meant to be fun and enjoyable and Riot have done very little improve this. Toxicity is at an all time high and trolls go unpunished. This entire give up first and try later method as you call it is a problem Riot has created not the player. The game has become far too focused on winning at all costs even fun game modes like Urf and Ultimate Spellbook are horrendously sweaty.

A lot of the time it’s positive interactions even with the other team. Just today a teammate said we need for healing reduction and literally next reset there was two morellos….
hm7utbd,Scribblord,11/26/2021,1,5.0,Well if they roam there’s not much you can do about it   Less kills on lane but more exp  As long as your support doesn’t feed or grief you they’re better than average from my experience

hm71v4c,KvotheM,11/26/2021,1,42.0,If someone left their team to be with their girlfriend of 2/3 months the teammates would probably want an explanation. Just because they got married for visa reasons doesnt really change that. The backlash has been kept at bay because people thought it was a family member passing away and now months later it is coming out that wasnt the case.   The whole relationship gives off really bad vibes (6-7 years older 2 divorces at 27 former sex worker/cam girl) and the reason is very likely not good enough to justify his actions.
hm81lj4,learclow,11/26/2021,1,18.0,Thank you!! 🥰
hm7yd83,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,55.0,The best move is to always fill once you get into select and pick normal roles for queueing.    If you could play all roles at an equally skilled level you should NOT queue for fill. Fill will only get you into game faster. You should queue the most popular role / role you think has the worst performer and fill the role that someone gets autofilled in (since someone on the enemy team will also likely have an autofill).   For me personally I am most comfortable playing mid > supp > ad > jg > top but would happily fill if someone was autofilled in my select.
hm8ad2y,gigZ2g,11/26/2021,1,4.0,Well you are playing a game that is 10+ years old. It not fresh. There arent 100k new players every day. Most of the fresh lvl 30 accounts are smurfs.

hm7rd0b,Mejalu,11/26/2021,1,15.0,I dont know either. Its only this community of all the games I play.  I think its because League is such a technical game that requires a lot more calculations than raw mechanical skill like most other games. On top of the fact the game has a lot of downtime where they can watch everyone elses mistakes and theres so much surrounding the game (LCS Coaching vods Youtube channels op.ggs lolalytics) that they think learning the game is like learning an actual skill in real life.   I also think most league players dont have much of a social life since it takes a remarkable amount of time to be good at this game. They get most of their social interaction from the internet stuff like reddit and game chat.   Also I think most league players only play league so they think this behavior is tame or normal when its actually psychotic

If you want a better understanding of the world you can do so by playing Legends of Runeterra their voicelines flavor text and art really add a lot to worldbuilding. If you want a closer experience to league PC go for Wild Rift. And if you want some actual story then play Ruined King or read the comics of Lux/Ashe/Zed.

hm6z2d8,elikaweli,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,I have to keep my shit together right now because what you are writing is just dumb af. Bro is it upsets fault that his family has an emergency? It is not. Who the hell to you think you are to judge whether his decision is right or not? You are a god damn random fan without any information and yet you judge that it is upsets fault that he had to leave. Personal problems in your god damn FAMILY are always more important than your job. You clearly have never experience something like a serious family emergency. That is completely fine. But dont judge it then.

Its not even remotely close. The skill difference from iron to diamond isnt even as large as it is from diamond to challenger.
hm730r8,GuyOnTheMoon,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,The situation overall is incredibly messy and full of misunderstandings. We as the viewers know nothing about the full story but what we do know is that no one is absolutely in the right on this.   The entire team including Upset put in incredible effort and time to get a spot in Worlds. And to see all that hard work get thrown away on such a short notice must definitely compel some emotions onto anyone. Upset is entitled to his privacy but Adam is also completely entitled to feel the way he felt when words aren’t exchanged for both parties to come to an understanding.  Yes it was unprofessional for Adam to air out how he felt in a twitlonger for the public. But it is also equally unprofessional of Upset to essentially ghost his own team members during thr most important tournament of their whole career.

hm71qyj,Rektile7,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Surely there is a decently acceptable run down of events without invading the privacy of the party affected that could be told to the 4 guys who got you to your first worlds? I wouldnt leave the team in the dark nor would i then go to management and talk about replacing 2 dudes who had amazing splits.
hm79fhl,Odd_Play_5769,11/26/2021,1,27.0,Those W and R buffs are from her firecracker skin werent they? I think they need to revert the R invis buffs since my bigger issue against her isnt the true damage but its that I cant see her most of the fight. One second of invis with a dash every 2 seconds is crazy for a 100-0 ADC.
hm89sgq,BloodiedSmile,11/26/2021,1,6.0,Im assuming theres a whole story here which Im kinda excited to figure out. Its like a whole easter egg really cool. But also it takes awhile to type each letter forward and backward to find more. Worth it but im also too lazy at the moment lol.
hm7xden,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,55.0,I think I could hit challenger on all roles given enough games (Im sure if I played 2000 on each role I would definitely hit challenger at least once (tyler1)) . I think the better answer would be giving which ones I think I could get the easiest.      support > ad > jg > top
hm7ie9s,Devenityy,11/26/2021,1,74.0,It was a family member passing or seriously ill. Kind of obvious from Upset & Dardo’s statements today.
hm7u2yv,IAmDaleicious,11/26/2021,1,105.0,Who knows. I’m not too confident on the top side for either DK or T1. Could be a three-headed race for playoffs.

hm73moo,jaguar317,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,I agree that you should be as transparent about yourself as possible but the issue here is that its not Upsets private information he would be sharing but someone elses. If for example someone you were close to was sexually assaulted. Would you really tell a coworker who youve known for 6 months who you see as an immature 19 year old kid about the specific details of the situation? How would the person who was sexually assaulted feel if you were spreading this information to people who have nothing to do with them?  Also youre putting the blame on Upset for defending himself when Adam was the one who escalated the situation sending massive amounts of hate towards upset when it had already been dying down. I dont agree with this at all.
hm7tk8r,SecondSoulless,11/26/2021,1,17.0,No problem bro. It can be easy for your friends to tilt and throw but the second you call them out for that being an asshole thing to do it typically turns things around. Hope you have some fun games!
hm6ytyt,Broken_Reality,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,No they dont deserve anything more than has already been given. Especially as it would just be spread about by the likes of Adam and Upsets private life would then be ripped apart by all those who are already doing what they are on twitter and reddit.
hm7v1ca,Lahwtiste,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,He could just like he couldnt.  People are free to decide what they do with their private life. Emergency family situation is enough to understand that its important and concerns his family.   As he mentioned it touches his family and thus isnt willing to take any risk concerning the privacy of the person(s) affected. Seems like he feels it isnt his place to tell and I personally respect that. It doesnt have to be controversial.  For your second hypothesis thats literally a straight insult towards Upset as a competitor and slightly as a person. Its been 4 years now that he tried to get to worlds and do everything he could to go there to compete and people assuming that hed be ok to leave for something trivial thats disrespectful as hell.  As a person ? How many times people need to be reminded by Upset himself but also others that the guy was apparently in fucking pain over it and yet youre all ready to speculate over that and disregard that.

I have found that most people “stuck” in this rank are either very young and/or lack any sort of critical thinking skill that this game requires.

hm7t39g,Silentsht5,11/26/2021,1,120.0,Unrelated to Talon but could someone also look at Seraphines Q skill. Since preseason there is 1 or 2 bugs with it. It either has to do with her enhanced Qs second wave only applying damage to the first target it hits and/or the Q itself not dealing damage at all if i lose vision of the target before the spell lands on the ground. It happened to me like 10 times in 2 games while wave clearing.

hm7fmvn,Le_Zoru,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,Je sais pas si t es francophone natif but you highly reinterpreted his tweets. The way you translate it it looks like kameto is blaming upset while hes just having fun of he and Bwipo saying he find it a lot of fun from upset to go home to see his babe and kind of ridiculous to pre lock your girlfriends main every single game (tho not in a harmful way more like bro thats funny but drop it way). Also he was originaly answering to someone saying True man will leave worlds for his girl. It was absolutely not a serious conversation.

hm7ci8a,CodeMonkeyChico,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,Yeah its not like any of his teammates are newer or prone to leaking details and posting objectively incorrect and ridiculous twitlongers. Crazy of him not to reveal intimate traumatic details of his wifes life to each of them individually.

hm7a4ic,Ajwf,11/26/2021,1,121.0,> If jojos upside is greater than Jensens vs money being spent... then why not?   ....It wont be. Thats the issue. Like money being spent and upside are conflicting here. Jensen is going to be better than any rookie you pick up in their first year. I fully expect Jensen to slot in on summer and that team to make Worlds and that team to make worlds *exactly at EGs expense* because EGs roster is a solid 3 in the league right now.

hm7e7ms,edgelordweeb_,11/26/2021,1,97.0,With it being made by Buzzfeed this is the likely outcome but a Gamergate comedy has potential bc the series of events was hilarious and basically everyone involved was a loser and an idiot fighting over shit that didnt even matter. Its less funny when you think about the effects its had on society as one leg of a wider push for identity politics to take over political discourse in the west and especially the United States in order to fracture the population and prevent people from continuing to realize the major division in society is class following the success of the Occupy Wall Street movement (until it got infiltrated that is). Regardless if you let yourself forget about the wider implications of it and why it happened Gamergate is pretty fucking funny.
hm8l5d4,Billy8000,11/26/2021,1,4.0,Eh this situation will pop up once out of every 3000 Neeko games and I’m here for those. 1/6 chance you get that drag and 1/500 chance it’s a possibility to happen
hm7nspj,vegeful,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,True if 3 out of 4 people were in to understand it i will just say that Adam just lack of understanding. But when its over 50% of your team dont even know wtf happening then its scream that the management has fail to give info.
hm865d7,Rengar_Is_Good_kitty,11/26/2021,1,159.0,Youre lucky that these bugs are easily reproducible should be somewhat easy for Riot to fix.  Rengars bugs are mostly random and he has far more bugs than Talon sucks playing Rengar when hes so incredibly bugged cant go a single game without something stupid happening only way to fix Rengar is to rewrite his code.
hm7r69e,Reshaos,11/26/2021,1,90.0,Is he using predator on Eve in a challenger level match though? Thats the big difference. You stick a challenger player in Gold elo and he could make conqueror runes work on Eve...  If your skill level is Plat and youre playing in Plat then you need to be using the right runes since you cannot afford to handicap yourself.

hm764rl,InsuranceOne2864,11/26/2021,1,1001.0, looks weird but i dont think its too much of a big deal. They might have just wanted to release some stress and what better way than their favorite thing to do?
hm8rg36,BoltzmannCurve,11/26/2021,1,12357.0,Twitch? Camille? Orianna?
hm71i3x,Musashis_Balls,11/26/2021,1,484.0,Buy back(essentially allowing you to 10v5 from behind. Slew of active items to deal with super fed carries even when behind. “Just to Shan and various jungle creeps”   I think league players would naturally underestimate just how important the jungle is to a true moba. They all spawn every minute in dota and are a viable way to catch up from a bad lane. They require you to control parts of the map with vision and are a huge reason why dotas macro makes so much more sense than leagues practically non existent macro. I just had a game with MK where I was 0-3 and was able to come back positive by the end of the game because they didn’t control our jungle so I was able to farm up some key items and become strong again.   If you lose lane in league it’s basically GG for you as you stand around in the back line hoping not to get picked off first.   Honestly you should watch pro dota games. It’s very common for a team to win even when they are down 10k+ net worth because they simply outplayed the other team. That would be an absolute impossibility in league. Even with dragon buffs the team that’s already ahead are just going g to grab those far easier so that ends up just being more of a “help the snowballing team snowball more” mechanic.
hm7invl,comso20,11/26/2021,1,,this is such a terrible opinion for so many reasons i dont know where to start. idk why you see relationships as some manipulative game where you can win or lose but i hope you either grow out of it as you grow up or seek help because thats not a healthy mindset to have.

hm6yxm6,shitlord33,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,More likely he had more than 12 hours to write a response this time. Imagine reading something like that out of the blue and having people harass you and your loved ones all of a sudden its not surprising that what he wrote was a bit all over the place. Dude was probably very emotional and had to rush out a response
hm7efqq,challengemaster,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,To add to that - if this had been going on for two weeks as a personal matter that upset communicated to the team that just worsened when they were at worlds just about to play - why did FNC coaching staff / management not properly prepare with Bean. Two 10 minute scrims is not adequate from their part if there was ever a doubt about Upset being able to play.

Tarzan was also a monster in 2019 and still is even now.  Mid: Chovy >=< Chovy  Bot: Ruler is fantastic but so is/was Viper (current world champ) and Viper was still very good and versatile in 2019 (Bot laner that could play mages very well at the time such as vlad)  Supp: GRF Lehends > HLE/AF Lehends. imo 2019 Lehends was better (relatively) then than he is now (HLE and AF werent as complete as 2019 GRF was that had threats in JG MID Bot  and also had better team fighting than DWG (GRF were DWG boogeyman before they imploded))

hm8nznq,Eragon_the_Huntsman,11/26/2021,1,564.0,As a kayle main I am a bit annoyed that they didnt keep iterating on the flight. The problem with the ability was it made her a god tier splitpusher since the moment anyone tried to rotate on her she could just fly out of the map and away or just over a wall and I agree that level 16 kayle should not be getting upgrades that incentivize avoiding fights. Still flight is such a core aspect to her theme that I wish they did more with it.  A while ago when I heard about it I was thinking about what they could have done with it (not that she needs anything right now shes very strong at the moment.) I though it would be cool if at level 16 she got a secondary range on her ult where if cast outside normal range she would channel for a moment then fly to her target to cast her ult pretty much like Galio. It would probably be crazy unbalanced but I think it would be an awesome way to get that guardian angel dropping from the sky to turn the tide feeling.
hm8oo0h,After_Signature_6580,11/26/2021,1,9.0,The account that gets all the gifts gets permabanned.  This has actually happened before. There was actually a case of it a few weeks ago.  Someone adds a stranger to their friends list. THey start playing games together. The stranger starts gifting the account skins. The money spent gets charged back. And the persons account gets permabanned.   People have also gotten banned the same way except the stranger emails Riot and says ________ has been boosting me for the last two weeks. Ive been gifting him skins as payment.  Repeat after me kids: you. are. responsible. for. your. own. account.  Not to mention Riot also uses that anti-cheat software that comes with the client. It runs in the background even when youre not playing League. So they know. It wont take long for them to figure out youre creating fraudulent Amazon accounts just for the Prime loot.

As soon as I arrived I did my full combo only to realise Shaco still at 90% HP left and began AFKing in the nearest bush. I was first time Sett and got my shit kicked in the enemy jungler got the kill I asked Shaco why did he leave.   Shaco: Calculated gold reset  That was the only thing he typed all game. I thought of just right-clicking the enemy fountain for a looooong time after that lmao
hm743os,Lahwtiste,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,Just to clarify : Most OTP casters simply reacted with the equivalent of It sucks something happened good luck in your next team to prove yourself as a player. They didnt shit or mock upset from what Ive seen with one exception about OTP and its Karnage (cofounder and the one who manage the broadcast).     Though yeah Kcorp original founder was part of the streaming community and sadly that community has a hard time to call out someone they like. They dont understand that you can still call out someones bullshit and still be a good friend with that person. Its simply high school mentality thats being shared and reproduced by fans.
hm7sg3q,leagueoflegendsdog,11/26/2021,1,252.0,You learn a lot of new shit. In s5-6 i had a team for go4lols in which we were me(bulgarian)2 polish1 from slovakia and 1 serbian. I had to document my flame in a notepad so i can know what to bring out against the different languages

hm7ge1m,edgelordweeb_,11/26/2021,1,43.0,Better players get solod by worse ones all the time. Biubiu back when he was a perma weak side top and played with 0 confidence solod 369 a few times. This year Biubiu got some balls and started playing carries but was still like the 11th best top yet he had one of the highest solo kill counts in the league and those werent all on the bottom six tops either. Ale solod TheShy repeatedly in his debut match against IG in 2019 spring. Thats fucking 2019 spring TheShy. Keane famously solod 2015 Bjergsen Zed repeatedly on old Urgot. Doesnt mean much. Besides Faker has declined and is pretty washed. He used to be way better it wasnt just competition being ass.
hm8jxau,aglimmerof,11/26/2021,1,177.0,Just wanna say it’s honestly so awesome when a rioter responds to a thread like these.  Thanks for giving us some of your time! I know it must be exhausting seeing so much complaining on here but they’re just the vocal minority. :)
hm7vox0,Jonoabbo,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Beating a player in one series does not mean you are a better player than him and of course Fnatic are going to bench Adam for Wunder one has had one good split the other is the best ever western top laner.   I think making a public twitlonger trying to weaponize your fanbase to attack your former teammates and employer purely out of spite is incredibly petty especially over what is completely normal and reasonable behaviour especially your teammate who you know is going an extremely difficult personal time hence hwy he left worlds. It is incredibly disrespectful to his team and his teams staff since he believes they would let Upset leave over nothing or something trivial.    To claim he bailed on them because he had a personal emergency is ridiculous.   Also you say adam was kicked out of 1 of 2 western teams that actually have a chance at doing anything internationally. Adam *isnt* up to that standard. Hes a good player but to pretend he is irreplaceable or some elite god is insane.

hm763rn,Lahwtiste,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,What Bwipo means with they were told nothing was about the departure.     Upset said that in the last 2 weeks of the bootcamp there were meetings where it was told that upset was going through a big family issues and it impacted him. Its only at the last moment (the famous 12h before worlds start) that the situation apparently got worse and Upset decided that he had to leave.    He might have considered leaving before but didnt share that it was a possibility and just tried to still push through.     Its not that they dont have empathy or have been lied to but maybe they think that if they knew beforehand that Upset leaving was a possibility they would have asked for Bean to share more scrim time or something even if it wouldnt have happened.

hm8la2l,-Basileus,11/26/2021,1,4.0,Its also pretty clear that  Yorick or Kalista werent there for example because they dont sell skins.  Hopefully Arcane makes the higher ups respect the importance of the lore.
hm7ewfz,henluwu,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,Considering that both bwipo and adam publicly complained about the situation its safe to assume that these 2 meetings didnt actually clarify anything. I highly doubt 3 of 4 players would go against upset if they were sufficiently informed about what could happen.

hm78izr,zetvajwake,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,The problem is that League of Legends isnt a regular job and Worlds isnt just another monday. By leaving Upset directly fucked with every single one of Fnatic players career money and general success. If I was Upset I would literally call my teammates every day apologize and give everything so I know they know there was no other solution but to leave. This was why Adam was mad. And then Upset came back and told Fnatic that he wants half the roster gone and they did that.
hm75did,Odd_Play_5769,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Then call them your coworkers not teammates. Teammates is something more than coworker. Were killing language so much that even people who speak the same language dont really agree on what anything means anymore. My 2 cents

hm7dmr2,edgelordweeb_,11/26/2021,1,97.0,It was ultimately horrible for the internet but it was pretty fucking funny to watch it unfold in real time ngl. Also making satire of it really funny is really easy bc you dont actually have to satirize it just take shit that actually happened and pretend you made it up as satire and no one would know any better. Watching weirdly misogynistic rightoid gamers battle it out with weird idpol obsessed shitlibs over vidya was fucking hilarious and produced some of the greatest comedy of the decade in spite of its overall incredibly negative effects.

Adam publicly flaming the shit out of Upset and attracting more hate towards him when he and his wife areivery obviously going through something personal is a huge douche move.

hm7b4pj,InvitemetoSkeet,11/26/2021,1,60.0,>DravenVarusKaiSaTristanaAshe and Kalista were all very very good with it in either SoloQpro play or both at the exact same time and only became worse after being directly nerfed by riot  Conq always outperformed soloq on Draven Draven was invisible in pro due to bans and picked to counter tristana. All onetricks think conq is better in soloq with hob outperforming in higher levels of play. Even then they dont agree as some always went conq. Soloq players went Conq such as ChadDraven Tyler1 PSZ while people that cared more for pro like JackSpektra and Arrow went for Hail of Blades. Asian Draven mains always went HOB. Draven did not get worse with it in soloq after HOB nerfs because more people stopped going that rune his wr actually increased. I know you are surprised but then you go on lolwiki and see that he was 110% bAD ratio on his Q so it actually makes sense.  Lethality Varus was the only way to play Varus so he is obviously going to take Hail of Blades. You Seriously thought lethality Varus was going to take precision runes? Other 3 were invisible last patch they werent bullying LT users like Twitch (I know your tumor in the head thinks HOB has higher winrate but thats AP twitch) Kog and Jinx.  >for all eternity even before the time that they were nerfed hmmf yes  Here are your words  Old Lethal Tempo had the problem of being hard outclassed by HoB on the big majority of its users with a few exceptions like Kog and Jinx  This is the contested point.  There is also this  Only thing that you are correct about HoB users not being all that goodbecause the current meta is dominanated by ADCs abusing lethal tempo  HOB users are not meta in the current meta because ADCs are abusing Lethal Tempo?  I refute this by saying they havent been meta for a while. I SPECIFICALLY used worlds as an example because  you are a dicksuck for probuilds. Pro players loved going HOB/Inspiration.  Like I said HOB was not meta in worlds what was being picked in worlds?  This was BEFORE more ravenous nerfs btw I am being nice to you by using this as an example.  Ziggs Aphelios Lucian Miss Fortune Jhin. 1 Lethal Tempo champ.  So here there are no  1. Oppressive Lethal Tempo champs bullying Hail of Blades users. 2. Hail of blades outclassing Lethal Tempo Lethal Tempo was actually represented more LOL.  None of the scenarios you talked about even occurred. You are in a fantasy land.  If you cant tell all of the ADCs outside of Aphelios were ult bots.  With MF doing less than 500 damage with kraken slayer.  I dont care about your moving goal posts dont bother replying you already agreed with me anyway see here:   >They were very good and only became bad after their direct nerfswhich were caused  There it is you called HOB champs bad in the context of a patch where new LT didnt exist.  Please dont embarrass yourself talking about ADCs [probuilds.com](https://probuilds.com) doesnt tell you everything.

hm6zvn5,Iperovic,11/26/2021,1,108.0,As much as people hate hearing this the only way to improve is to focus on yourself and look at what you could have done better to win  Yes its absolutely an unfair thing because sometimes it will mean youll literally have to 1 vs 9 or 2 vs 8/3 vs 7 with someone else which shouldnt be the case in a matchmade game but thats just the nature of 5 randoms teaming up  Take it from me as someone who peaked in GM I can steamroll through lower elo and no matter how garbage the other players in my team are up until like Dia IV Im certain I can basically 1 vs 9 just on pure mechanical skill and game knowledge  The moment you hit that dead-end of not knowing what else you could have done to win and just give up mentally means youve hit your peak elo  If your friend doesnt auto win any lane hes assigned to hes at the correct rank for his skill level and its only up to him to improve
hm724pu,FaeeLOL,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Im yet to hear somebody even speculate a reason that would not only warrant such an instant ditch from the climax of their pro careers but also have the reason be such sensitive that you can not share it with your teammates whose years of hard work your situation has flushed down the drain.  If there is an excellent reason to leave then sharing it seems obvious since the teammates would understand. To me it seems a weird contradiction that the reason is also of such sensitive nature that you cant say it even when not saying it comes with exact issues like this. Seriously please somebody come up with a reason that fits? Any death in the family does not even seem significant enough imo. If somebody has passed away your urgent presence there doesnt exactly fix the situation. And even then that should not be something you absolutely need to hide. It is legitimately hard to come up with a reason that fits both criteria of extreme importance to be there instantly AND of such sensitive nature that you cant say it.

hm72363,Prottek,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,FNC required a PR to handle this if you look at the previous response considering how big the situation is it did not look well for the org and its normal for someone else to write the response for a player when it comes to that.
hm7w35q,UltraScept,11/26/2021,1,124.0,You are also similarly operating off of assumptions though? It is not like you have concrete facts of what happened. Youre basing your argument on a single statement Upset made about leaving due to a family emergency.  Its completely up to you to take Upsets words at face value but to then turn around and insult people because they are only assuming things is quite hypocritical.

hm70p8u,Iperovic,11/26/2021,1,57.0,Because technically putting your team at a disadvantage is unfair towards the other people  If youre gonna try a new champ that is completely out of your comfort zone both thematically and in terms of the role they occupy maybe start with 20 bot games so you can at least be confident you know what their abilities are like in-game
hm8l7sf,JevonP,11/26/2021,1,8.0,Component items are significantly worse if not bought at the right times which kinda sucks but  I do think the item system is better now   One thing I dislike is how much damage there is in the game and the items could shine more if everyone wasnt so op so early now

hm8pxka,Umarill,11/26/2021,1,12.0,Just admit to it and stop trying to pass it off as something it isnt. Tracing is nice for practicing telling people its something you drew is just bullshit.  Everything lines up pixel perfectly you are not gonna convince anyone that you managed to recreate the scene accurately to the pixel without tracing lol

His team deserves to know tho. At least enough information to not being able to make assumptions and they did so that means they dint get enough information and that’s on upset and the leader ship of fanatic.

hm721gu,frenkli_h,11/26/2021,1,21.0,the first 15 games ive played were duos (u can check it urself)  i had with 2 friends that were new to the game  and u can see what happend when i stopped duoing   (20/3 xayah game and onwards)    i lost 3 games in 12 played and  the lp gains i had i arleady told u them   ur not 37-9 in plat  most of ur games are around gold mmr  and like i said ur playing a better role with a better champion and ur playing triple the games im playing idk what u expect  please  stop speaking out of ur ass
hm7baqb,haven4ever,11/26/2021,1,87.0,Damn if Khan joins GenG the Choke Factor will suffer an integer overflow and they will stomp Worlds 2022 and go undefeated.
hm7ddoz,OvenCheese5000,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,This is why some sort of hierarchy might be needed.  After all FNC is Upsets employer and Upset is FNCs employee. If at my job I had some family emergency or something like that which required that Id be home and not working at one of the most crucial times Id have to notify my boss and tell him the reasons. He in turn would communicate this to my coworkers: both that Ill be missing and that its justified without revealing details. Thats because we can trust our boss to not give someone a pass on a bullshit excuse.   There should be a person where players are able to tell such personal stuff a person has the authority to make the call that its justified a person that the players can trust not to bullshit them if they agree with the player wholl miss a tournament.
hm77nvi,TheWarmog,11/26/2021,1,42.0,Whatever their relationship could be its not your business.    Whatever the lenght of it is and will be its not your business.   Whatever the reason they got married for is its not your business.   Whatever her past or age difference is its not your business.   Your parents failed you with the education they gave you grow the fuck up.
hm7ms7e,DT-Z0mby,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,if its that easy why doesnt everyone look good when the team plays around them. the way you make it sound is that you could take any random LEC adc play around him and he looks stellar. its a bit more nuanced than that
hm7h68f,Kunzzi1,11/26/2021,1,89.0,Sound levels were scuffed and all over the place but other than that pretty great video. Give them time I just hope this team actually tries and develops future goats of LEC similar to G2 of 2019.

hm7zpyn,Dvscape,11/26/2021,1,156.0,Something that I found actually helpful is narrating out loud my thought process. Even if I am alone in game but even more so when streaming on Discord I talk through my decisions and it:  1) keeps my gameplay organized no autopilot  2) anchors my mind and makes it much harder to tilt or rage (since I have to be narrating my decision process instead of complaining about the past)  If your friend doesnt find it weird maybe ask them to try it out.
hm7bwb2,ezprodigy,11/26/2021,1,157.0,clearly you have never been to eastern europe English is definitely not the most common language there
hm7djcj,Seneido,11/26/2021,1,,sometimes they are just dumb and naive like i dont get money if i dont play but why should they kick me? im the best. i also wouldnt be surprised if a lot of them are just believing and handshaking stuff like perkz/ocelote. i doubt that perkz does anything nowadays without a roster of laywers next to him.
hm82gdc,leagueoflegendsdog,11/26/2021,1,277.0,Ah. Damn fk that thought i can do something :(
hm7wtqk,Angelothebaws,11/26/2021,1,15.0,Thats easy its simply because Jinx voice lines together wit other older champions needs updates. A lot of them has non be update even since the entire old lore was change Blitzcrank is the best example he still has all the murder intention voice lines when now he should not have since he is not the old murder machine Blitzcrank.
hm7xwrg,karkuri,11/26/2021,1,11.0,i always play with my friend and there have been so many matches we have won because we didnt ff at 15 because enemy kata was 5/2/4. people give up way too fast
hm7fzof,Arcadis,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,Lol how to dodge the point 101. Stay ignorant and racist if thats what you want bro
hm7dq37,3SeedsForNAisaJoke,11/26/2021,1,643.0,Oh look its Frodolas the well known racist troll on this subreddit. Imagine an American accusing others of being racist given what has happened and has been highlighted in America in recent times. Learn to read the room. The whole world is watching you shaking their heads.
hm72799,Volknair,11/26/2021,1,119.0,Willing to bet even nemesis has a better record considering Fnatic went 4-2 in groups both years he was in and the lost 3-1 and then 3-2 which puts him at 11-10
hm7772e,Finkis,11/26/2021,1,84.0,Lol what are you talking about.. If the Ornn has half a brain and I dont have flash an Ornn ults Im slowed by the first part of his ult then knocked up then knocked up again by his Q-E and Wd followed by the empowered auto. This is just one example. Pick a tank. They can solo a lot of ADCs. I can avoid quite a bit. Its the principle that it shouldnt be a thing. If youre a tank youre a tank. You shouldnt be able to that much damage to a squishy.

hm7t45r,uncertainrandompal,11/26/2021,1,124.0,well you can just 2+2 knowing that and the fact 3/4 team just leaves because of him.   upset still didn’t said anything and his words doesn’t match with truth.   also with history of his 2/3 month ex porn star gf 6 years older and 2 marriages before everything could be.
hm8qpwj,imjunsul,11/26/2021,1,58.0,DK TheShy would be more hype but I have a feeling its T1 so DK dont get a top laner.. TheShy would probably perform well on a team with Canyon/Showmaker/Deokdam... I hope its not T1 TheShy tho it would suck to see Zeus not play or maybe theyll rotate again...
hm80utf,InsuranceOne2864,11/26/2021,1,110.0,even their european streamer is a 3 time runner-up
hm7ok49,Elibu,11/26/2021,1,,>This is like typical american mentality  Np. Its valuing privacy and not everyone needing to know everything. Like what the fuck? Do you just tell everyone everything about your life?  Also. Im not American (  >Yamato and the other manager hasnt leaked anything yet.  yes because they are decent people. From what we know of Bwipo and Adam in those regards they dont seem to be.
hm7i4a1,RemoteAnalysis3809,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,I mean if the consequence of this whole incident for Upset is him still earning his millions with Fnatic still able to fuck his beautiful wife and still starting as adc in one of the most stacked roster in the LEC next split then yes he is free of the consequence of **you** forming opinions about him.   The reality is people whose opinions truly matter to him have already voiced their support for Upset. Dude got the support of his coach his org his wife his (adult and non-French) fans. I say he got his priorities right.
hm76zjk,InsuranceOne2864,11/26/2021,1,1003.0, Never thought about that but this might actually be it.    While their marriage is obviously based on a real relationship the german government might actually think it was just one of those visa related marriages considering how fast they got wedded. Maybe periodic checks on them are a thing?    A couple of years ago i knew someone who married an american just for a visa. The USA government would send someone every 2 weeks to check on them.

hm74xcy,I_hate_Teemo,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,Why would he be a weasel for not telling them about his loved ones private life? I just dont understand. Noone that complained has moral or legal right to know about these private matters. It was made very clear that this was serious enough for him to leave and thats all anyone that isnt his family needs to know. The relevant people in fnc management were told confirmed it was serious enough and let him go without repercussions. Noone else needs to know.
hm7urnz,AEDSazz,11/26/2021,1,161.0,C9 Incarnati0n yep op missed that I guess
hm7z4q0,Soleah,11/26/2021,1,55.0,Depends on your elo.  Supports do prepare cs for your adc under tower for example so they should/do know how to cs.  Couple that with a roaming champion and supports can do just fine in mid.  Its really not that hard to play a predator malz or veigar for example.
hm836kk,SocialistScissors,11/26/2021,1,3.0,I checked and it is true for both Astronaut Veigar and rammus. Im guessing it is true for the other ones aswell.  Both have rise  trying to figure out the rest.  Edit: Veigar is To their Surprise He returned
hm7kgr0,Rikkimaaruu,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Iam german and learned basic english in school like most europeans.  But i put som effort into getting better so i could communicate with People i met over the Internet. Like the russian doctor which i met in Diablo 2 two polish dudes i met in Starcraft Broodwar or the danish girl i met in Quake 3.  We all struggled with out english but it got better over time.  If you rerufse to learn english for whatever reason you miss out like 80% of the Internet Content.  And when you play Multiplayer Games and you refuse to learn at least some basic english you are doing it wrong.  Nothing wrong sticking to people who speak your native language and mostly communicate in your native language that way.  But its mostly french people who stick out when it comes to these incidents. I heard its harder for french people to learn english that could play a role but still that should not hinder you from at least trying.
hm8c43d,TheScyphozoa,11/26/2021,1,4.0,>so i know its impossible to only play with bots  Not true. You can play with yourself + 4 bots vs 5 bots.  You will never level up your account so youll need to pay real money for every champion you want to play as...
hm73g3w,Naerlyn,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Thats normal though (your experiences with this I mean).   Part of the French people will speak French even though there are people around who wont speak that language. The other part will stick to English unless everyone is French. (You could say that about every language/nationality only with different proportions for each with obviously countries like France Spain and Germany having a lot more of the former than Nordic countries.)  The people who speak French while some of the people listening dont understand it are for the most part not exactly the most respectful. Or the most enjoyable ones to be around. So examples of the less pleasant cases.   On the other hand the ones who dont speak French in the presence of people of other nationalities... youd usually not know that theyre French. So the near-entirety of your experiences comes from the first part.
hm7u2gr,MapPotential9009,11/26/2021,1,243.0,Because it looks good for esports. More fighting = a more exciting game to watch.
hm71m4p,TheNedsHead,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Oh stop how did I know Id see this here? The games have language options and the morons are joining english speaking parties in a cooperative game and refusing to speak English. Thats stupid. Also I speak Spanish just fine as well but the Mexicans on my server make an effort to communicate in English just like I make an effort to communicate with them!   But DAE USA bad?

hm7etw4,akutasame94,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,And you forgot Rich from H2K... How is he realted to them?   Tho I do think bitching about it online is immature when you take into consideration all the facts both sides sound fishy.  Also now we know something has been going on for quite a bit and it turned awful at the very end when he left so I dont see how Adam Bwipo or Nisqy were not aware something was going on but I also see no reason why they would like about it and feel so salty to air the dirty laundry online.

hm8l04m,SamsungBaker,11/26/2021,1,10.0,This is the right answer its not that you lose skill with age but you just simply lose motivation / burnout    Playing 12h+ everyday get tiring + the game always change so you have to adapt a lot

hm6yivc,MrChologno,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,You hit the nail in the head there. The main problem is people dont believe him because one of his teammates questioned the severity of the event publicly.
hm8s8du,ASKSABOUTPENISSIZE,11/26/2021,1,35.0,I’ve mained Udyr for 9 years and there are ALOT of things that counter him but not much in the strict 1v1 early game.   Some junglers who can duel him early-ish include: Viego Xin Trundle and Warwick.    Udyr is countered by him being fucking useless in team fights unless he is massively ahead. He has no dash lacklustre AOE damage Only 1 single target  CC and poor damage if not ahead.   Skarner should be able to hold his own against Udyr once the Skarner gets items but like you said not many champs beat Udyr at level 4 in a straight up 1v1. Take solace in the fact that Udyr gets out scaled by pretty much every champ in the game after two items.
hm7g8gs,Brain_Tonic,11/26/2021,1,144.0,Hmm in this case its just that his team is greeding for megabucks. Not really a lack of demand for him no one can afford his buyout.

hm8leto,DodgerFntic94,11/26/2021,1,3.0,Without watching the video imma guess its because most people check the skin owned tab which removes these since they arent from skins but from the base
hm7uymh,FEAR_LORD_DUCK,11/26/2021,1,7737.0,>if she didnt immediately jump into his arms just have Powder open up to Silco without that and then have Silco empathize with and comfort her.  to me it seemed more like an angry tackle before she simply gave up and confided in the bad guy. Powder needed Vi but she had left and she believed she abandoned her. Especially after what she had done to her family it felt understandable for powder to jump in Silcos arms.  She was willing to confide in anybody who would listen to her and understand.
hm7dwyw,phranq,11/26/2021,1,,Just like Upset can not say what he wants. Adam can say what he wants. And everyone can form their own opinions with the knowledge they’ve been given.

hm7jnyp,Craftingistheway,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Adam requested to leave because he was butthurt someone even considered Alphari over him because of his overinflated ego.   Bwipo goes to a worse team then FNC?!?!? What?! I mean MAYBE but he is making bank while getting to play with 2 literall legends of the game in one of the possible best NA rosters ever....     Nisqy got fucked by FNC greeding his buyout nothing to do with worlds.  You literally dont know the most basics facts of the story for fucks sake .     Matter of the fact is that those 2 fucktards could not even accept emergency  when basically confirmed by the org as valid who have the information. What else is FNC supposed to do? They cannot reveal details they can just say he was legit to leave which they did. They didnt even look for a replacement...     Like your entire argument is based on ignorance and that full tilt children tantrum of Adam and Bwipo is anything but shameful and inexcusable.
hm7rplz,Jiffyyy,11/26/2021,1,124.0,if hes allowed any personal time off in his contract you arent gonna get shit.  also what the hell would you sue him for? taking time off?
hm7wvb8,IHadThatUsername,11/26/2021,1,364.0,That was just a throwaway dig. Change that to until this year Upset couldnt qualify if you wish the point stays the same: Attila was more successful than Upset for a while and although they are quite distant now that doesnt change the fact that they had a competitive rivalry.
hm713cx,maribri6,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Actually talking to them and explaining stuff ? Instead of saying trust me bro. Cause you have to remember that Bwipp had said in his TL he didnt understand why Upset left so the two meetings Upset is talking about mustve not led to a lot of communication.  You know communication. But hey seems FNC is bad at it since they always have drama with their players.

hm7fdsb,edgelordweeb_,11/26/2021,1,47.0,Bc orgs are gonna be willing to pay them a higher salary if the players agree to stay for a longer period of time. They want them on longer contracts so if theyre good the orgs just hold them and if they suck the org can just sell the contract anyways.

And while Im ranting how crazy is it that his nemesis Viego shows up as the bad guy in two back-to-back events (Ruination and Pentakill) and Yorick has to just sit on the sidelines both times? Somehow the very out-of-place Pyke and Rengar get to be sentinels and Mordekaiser is the one to take on the guitar battle?

hm8ooo8,The_Cool_Mule,11/26/2021,1,13.0,Theres too much damage so tanks are in a bad spot.  Okay pretty normal reddit complaints so far.  Theres way too much CC.  Wait isnt that what tanks do?  Theres too many overloaded and poorly designed kits like Aatrox Illaoi Kaisa Soraka and Wukong  Op really threw the darts at the board on this one. Btw the games player count keeps going up every year significantly. Your anecdotes about you and your friends dont apply to the entire playerbase. Turns out people like making flashy plays and having games be sub-30 minutes instead of long farmfests. Not that there isnt fun in long strategic games there is but those games are so tiring and most people dont feel like queueing up afterwards.
hm7rje8,Llamalord48,11/26/2021,1,120.0,And hes still op
hm7gghl,Brain_Tonic,11/26/2021,1,144.0,Baseless conjecture stop assuming owners are nice.
hm8jy4q,OG-Ichorous,11/26/2021,1,7.0,Zoom is a hard carry player. What are you on about?
hm8dvfn,meDeadly1990,11/26/2021,1,298.0,So after we had 2-3 hour login queues for a whole year you straight up wanted it back after the Server split that fixed the issue? Hard doubt
hm7z685,bluebaron913,11/26/2021,1,55.0,Congrats on the rank! Whats the college esports scene like from your perspective?
hm772d3,Kaoms__Heart,11/26/2021,1,73.0,Is Uzis dad named Gatling Gun or something?
hm7ie39,KeijiKiryira,11/26/2021,1,18.0,Based on what I’ve witnessed this is true. They are 100% coinflips in low silver. My teammates consistently have no idea how to play against certain champions and end up feeding them.
hm86fc6,Faintpt,11/26/2021,1,106.0,Good job bro congrats!If you got plat4 you can easily get diamond glhf
hm8s1g2,LeFiery,11/26/2021,1,8.0,Damn you sound like hashinshin. Why not play another lane? I switched to mid
hm8iqb8,SW_foo1245,11/26/2021,1,31.0,dealing vs an udyr is a CD game wait until the effect  of either q or r(tiger or Phoenix) runs out and attack him then wait again/run again stun doesnt deal dmg he will go oom pretty fast.
hm7jpxy,Vangorf,11/26/2021,1,,Yeah sure in a team with bot focus they had much chance to carry after their main focus player left :^) look at their first game Bwipo omegagapped the enemy jungler but since they didnt had Upset in bot they couldnt play their usual style.
hm7p0c7,maruchops,11/26/2021,1,5.0,Supports are supposed to roam if its advantageous. If theyre just routinely leaving theyre just bad.  Some support champs shouldnt be roaming either.
hm7x0jr,derreverend,11/26/2021,1,3.0,That would require extensive rewrites of code. Almost every blocking ability consists of minions. Also I don’t think minionblock is harmful necessarily
hm7cnuu,Proterragon,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,My man teammates are people who play in the same team nothing more nothing less. Thats the definition. Teammates may be professional and formal or informal and more like family or close friends. They may trust each other completely or just be distant acquaintances. You have some weird romanticized idea of the concept of teammates.  Your problem stems from the fact that you made up a different definition in your head and then that leads you to a misunderstanding with others. Cheers.
hm832r8,Teal_is_orange,11/26/2021,1,10.0,Hate it when ppl trace then claim an art piece as their original work :((
hm7kua6,PresentMiddle8974,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Useless pr apology or something. This guy seriously should not be on a team. Next year same thing. If he even makes it to worlds this time after nuking his whole teams run then being a leading force in kicking them out haha. What an idiot.
hm7fxo0,Brain_Tonic,11/26/2021,1,144.0,I think so makes his current situation even more ridiculous.
hm7x6d6,Seneido,11/26/2021,1,,it depends on the region ofc and sure there are hundreds but do people even get the biggest 10? i would guess most get around 1-3.
hm7uihs,ToasterHoaster,11/26/2021,1,563.0,Hi N7 pyke mid has seen a bunch of nerfs after he migrated to mid and he’s kinda in a weird place where he’s not the best mid or support. But with the new assassin item buffs I think he’ll be fine in either lane. Either way you’ll be playing not as a carry but more supportive. Gank as much as you can and help your jgler contest for scuttle and such. Once lvl 3 you’ll try to get picks and win 2v1s top and jg. It’s all about carrying your team since you’re not able to 1v9.  P.S. I’m not exactly the best player but I used to play a bit of him. I might be wrong but I hoped it helps you a lil bit
hm8a5k3,Krism_47,11/26/2021,1,8.0,I mean yorick can with his r but Im not sure if that counts as a minion wave. Other than that a fed tryndamere might be able to
hm7fw0k,No_Principle_4593,11/26/2021,1,74.0,No question asked later no justification required? You can just say whatever and leave and no one will tell you anything? Yeah sure mate....

hm74rst,InsuranceOne2864,11/26/2021,1,1002.0, Upset didnt vouch for alphari management asked him to talk to him. Management wanted adam out which is perfectly normal after his performance in finals+worlds. (dont you dare tell me troll building items losing lane hard and having 0 map awareness is due to tilt).   > one guy literally pissed 3 players in one team   I understand bwipo being pissed of but nisqy has absolutely no right to open his mouth. Maybe he should stop eating mcdonalds so he can actually press the r button.

hm8qzjl,MI8MarkusXx,11/26/2021,1,134.0,How did you get put into a gold 4 game without a duo
hm7s72b,YogurtclosetMiddle78,11/26/2021,1,149.0,The 2 events didnt happen at the same time. Jayce went down to Benzos shop and bought parts. Ekko followed him to see where he lived and went back. He then gives the tip to Vi who gets her gang together to go rob him. Which I will say the show doesnt tell you how much time has elapsed between these events so I can understand but we can assume he took those items over to his benefactor after he got home it is their gold he just spent so he would probably have to show what he spent it on. Only reason I say we can assume that is because he is coming back with Caitlyn which she wouldnt have gone down there. So the events of Ekko getting back and telling Vi Vi getting the gang and breaking in would happen between that period. Hell nothing to say him buying the parts could have happened the day before and went first thing in the morning to show what he bought to his patrons and thats when Vi broke in. Which is very plausible with the information we are given.  As far as Jayce and his decisions goes the show setup his personality from the get go he is honest and good but very naive. He wants to do right by his inventions but he keeps getting thrust into situations and leadership roles that he doesnt know how to handle. Which in steps Mel to manipulate him and the situation to her favor which he relies on because he is in over his head. You can tell that Jayce is more like himself when Mel isnt around to offer guidance.  As for Caitlyn I think she made that document and just used his stamp herself to get Vi out of prison...there is a point where they are telling Jayce what Caitlyn has been doing and the document is brought up showing his sigil on his there is a look of surprise and confusion on his face so thats the take away I got from that lol. Could be wrong on that point though not entirely sure. 😃

hm7ipnz,Random_Stealth_Ward,11/26/2021,1,540.0,Nah that was old Poppy. Ult support and kill someone else.  Fioras problem iirc was that she is already a good duelist and very mobile so when you combine that with a trapping ult you basically got a free kill on whoever you trapped and you could easily get on top of people to trap so it was too strong. Basically a rigged game..

hm76hiw,Kaiserov,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Wtf? No the team dosent deserve to know personal details about his life *especially* children like Adam whove known him for 6 months.  Management was told as they are apparently mature enough to be trusted to keep the matter private. And they deemed the issue sufficient to keep him in the team.

hm72lce,Suspicious-Bus6351,11/26/2021,1,74.0,If you look at stats from the series Chovy was up in Gold XP and CS at 10 minutes against Faker. I dont know why people get so upset with the idea that Chovy beats Faker in lane he beats everyone in lane it isnt exactly a controversial statement.
hm7ej9j,amroth6464,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,the famous power of friendship bro.
hm8nphk,Initial_Length6140,11/26/2021,1,29.0,Ima hope youre joking  but just in case you arent.  Pick rate does matter when looking at win percentage. A sol has been hovering a 53% win rate for 2 years now... does that mean hes broken? Of course not if you look at his play rate its stupidly low and you realize that the reason a sol has a high win rate is due to him only being played by one tricks. While a 2% pick rate is pretty average and swain does need a small nerf that doesnt mean hes broken. If you look at swain players who pilot him into ranked you realize most of them get shit on bc you cant just keyboard smash on him.
hm8mjph,Pileae,11/26/2021,1,174.0,Can you elaborate? My understanding of attack-move is that itll have you autoattack what your champ is nearest to. Does it autoattack whatever is closest to the cursor?

hm71pun,Miyaor,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Cant behind its just a joke if youre that well known. Like if I say Enkenz gf should just stay in the kitchen instead of on twitter then even if its obvious I am not saying it seriously there will be tons of people who seriously echo that sentiment.   I dont even think Upset was in the right in how he handled it but there has been too much hate thrown his wifes way. If its only thrown at him it sucks but he is a public figure. His wife isnt a pro and shouldnt be even mentioned by other figures unless they want them to rain hate on her.
hm7ph87,Wedbo,11/26/2021,1,89.0,USD has been reserve currency since 1944 dawg
hm7tz6j,pannucci,11/26/2021,1,105.0,Pretty much he was second in laning stats last year anyways on a terrible team. The top 4 of last year was really far ahead of the rest. There is a pretty big drop off to canna tbh. He was the next best.
hm82dhe,DomFreecss,11/26/2021,1,85.0,Adc right now are so weak because games end so fast. Also its the only role  that you can get solod by literally any champ in the game. It was my secondary role for years but its just so unfun to play now.
hm7uqyo,MapPotential9009,11/26/2021,1,243.0,Pretty much. Unless you play an AD Assassin Riot doesnt care about you. Playing Ivern is troll at this point and is hindering your own team. Such a shame that Riot wont address Iverns issues.
hm8htc7,doglop,11/26/2021,1,12.0,Rigth.... maybe cause high level adcs knows how to deal with her(altought she has over a 53% wr). When you play in plat and below adcs just let her exist and dont punish her and her short range which is her more exploitable disadvantage

hm7trog,Tilterino247,11/26/2021,1,161.0,I dont see any reason at all that theyd have to stick to the terms of the original contract if both parts want out and both parts certainly do. They could easily come to terms at a rate any team could afford.
hm7l5nq,jixxor,11/26/2021,1,555.0,Ever since season 12/ pre season started my game is stuttering like crazy for the first 60-70 seconds on Summoners Rift (havent yet played any other mode). Basically it is 1-3 second screen freezes every 5-10 seconds. The FPS before the freezes start is stable 144 then after the freeze ends the FPS counter jumps to 40\~ and immediately back up to 144 where it stays until the next freeze. I did the client repair and re-installation both had no effect. Windows and drivers up to date no other game having issues League also had no issues before the pre-season patch.  Does anyone have any clue as to what is going on?

hm81rke,Mazsi1201,11/26/2021,1,7.0,I can almost guarantee that the system Riot actually uses is designed for the 5 v 5 games making reasonable changes to the ELO system so that it can support 5 v 5 games better isnt rocket science (although truelly optimizing the system is a very complex problem). And its not the arts department that works on matchmaking algorithms
hm8m6mc,moxroxursox,11/26/2021,1,26.0,Vayne is balanced af if you just play mages (not even necessary bot lane a good mid mage player will make Vaynes life hard in teamfights). If you insist on playing the things she can easily just kite or 1v1 duelists then yeah youre going to have a bad time.
hm7axp0,TH3RM4L33,11/26/2021,1,65.0,Talon has to be up there top 5 at least.

hm70gz4,-LostInCloud-,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,To anyone that has compassion and 3 braincells this should have been obvious:   Of course its neccessary that Upset leaves otherwise he would have not missed it.
hm709gy,KonanTenshi,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,It’s pretty obvious that whatever reason upset left for he doesn’t think that everyone (at least on his team) will agree that it is justified for him to leave.

hm6zd56,Key_Divide3166,11/26/2021,1,1003.0, we can also argue that upset lacked empathy towards his teammates and this lack of empathy made them go through hell at a time that should be one of the most important of their lives
hm814hq,NiixxJr,11/26/2021,1,569.0,I agree. As a Renekton player Teemo was a rough matchup... But winnable by waiting out his blind it was actually a really fun matchup as a OTP because it was super skillbased. If I got a few kills Id stomp him and vica versa.  Now I have to ban him. I want to ban Camille dammit.
hm6xwfa,Lawshow,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,We don’t know the details. For all we know all the money could be locked behind a prenup.

hm86f1a,w23333,11/26/2021,1,143.0,Then don’t blame Adam for feeling shitty and cheated when his entire year got taken away because of unknown factors. How many times is he going to have the chance to play at Worlds in his career?
hm834gc,castrozaka,11/26/2021,1,92.0,why not? No one takes NA seriously even in its own playerbase. Im not trying to be too antagonistic but it feels like these feat AMA posts are mostly from NA nowadays. It gives the impression people dont do the biggest feats anywhere near as often on EUW because of the skill disparity.  The term big fish in a normal pond applies no?

hm7fzeo,Jiffyyy,11/26/2021,1,74.0,hes been playing for 6 years professionally gets his first chance to play at worlds and something comes up in his life and your go to question is about whether he even cares to play? where does that notion come from? I cant speak for you personally but people will choose family over their job if something devastating enough to leave the team happens.  you are no different than the rest speculating because you dont know the truth but want to keep prying away to get it and will attack him because you want answers you are not entitled to.
hm7f5ak,JamisonDouglas,11/26/2021,1,184.0,But theres 0 point doing MMR resets until they fix the flex queue and normal games effecting soloq MMR. People will just make new accounts and exploit still.

hm6y3yz,ArsenixShirogon,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Yeah Upset offered Hyli more details but Hyli trusted Upset that it was important and told Upset there wasnt a need for further elaboration
hm7ugn2,MapPotential9009,11/26/2021,1,243.0,Pretty much. Hes a forgotten champion that will never see a rise in play because Riot simply doesnt like niche characters. They would rather everyone play assassins
hm6z78y,maribri6,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Yes he did. A bad performance at worlds decreases the chance for players to go to good teams. Both Bwipo and Adam are going to teams that are worse than FNC and Nisqy doesnt even have a team next year.  No just saying emergency isnt enough for most people cause why would they trust you if you dont trust them. Therefore its managements job to make sure reactions like that dont happen. How do you not get it? Managements job (I include coach in management) is to take care of players and also make sure they dont do dumb shit. At least thats how it works in all sports except at FNC apparently...

hm861p1,Tuft64,11/26/2021,1,11.0,I mean if you want to call a team filled with some of the best academy talent from the last two years a bunch of nobodies and hate on your own team then thats your prerogative but personally I think this team is way more exciting than last years where every player was thrown together without much thought being given to team identity with no focus on development while expecting a handful of solid players to somehow perform at the level that they did in their prime under a rookie head coach.
hm7wlix,MapPotential9009,11/26/2021,1,246.0,Im sure theyre aware of the issue they just dont care about Ivern because he isnt played much and doesnt sell skins.
hm7ww43,Adventurous-Sport-45,11/26/2021,1,,Still I have also heard some theories suggesting that she might bear some relationship with Leona. Mel has an inordinate amount of sun imagery in her design and the scenes that she is in and her mothers name sounds a bit like the Amharic word for lioness.
hm7kbrm,NUFC9RW,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,No offense to him but so many people have to keep working through family members dying. I had a family member pass when I was in the middle of exams away from home in my first year of university and had to continue to the end of the exam period but Im sure others have gone through worse. The public dont need to know but his teammates careers were affected and they deserve to know more than family emergency.
hm7du7i,phranq,11/26/2021,1,,Cool story. I said people are free to think what they want. He isn’t free of the consequence of people forming opinions about him.
hm78obv,Kierenshep,11/26/2021,1,518.0,The best part of this is that Sunfires used to stack so youd go all tanks or all invisible Champs (evelynn used to be permanently invisible even next to champions and twitch was pretty much permanently invisible with q max) and just sit on the enemy til they died.  It was hilarious as eve because you did like 200 damage / second just sitting on someone with like 4 Sunfires. I still remember being in top lane and walking with this poor sap whos health just kept draining and draining until he died. Sucker.   5 tanks was hilarious because you now had like 150 dps * 5 meatshields = 700 dps in this clumped meatball. Teams melted. And since the only way to beat that was to split push fortify / teleport shored up that weakness.   Was disgustingly fun

hm7uc9b,Young_Khalifa,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Oh but you can.  At the end of the day esports is a business. Treating teams like something more is foolish and naive. They aren’t friends or brothers just teammates and coworkers. If you think someone would be better at a job especially when we’re talking about a job with only 5 spots for players its in your best interest to get the best player.  Does Upset have the moral high ground? Probably not but that’s pretty irrelevant given its a business decision the kind of thing that happens all the time in other fields of work.

hm70s6n,BigBadDogLol,11/26/2021,1,24.0,But you CAN go HEALTH vs both dummy. Read my comment. I said you can buy health vs both.   Edit: the comment I’m referring to said you can’t build against true damage like your can do physical with armor. I said you can counter both with health items as both will be as effective against both types and even magic. This wasn’t SPECIFICALLY FOR VAYNE. Also to beat vayne you lower attack speed and hp will also work but not as much vs most true damage
hm7jvl5,Miyaor,11/26/2021,1,,Upset leaving without telling them is also not decent.  He has basis though. Its literally what he was told.  I will say Adam posting it definitely wasnt the nice thing to do. I am defending him doing it because I dont see it as any worse than what Upset did and I hold Upset at fault for the full thing. Do you think Upset didnt know what would happen to his teammates if he left them like that? He obviously knew it was important to tell the teammate he liked which is the only teammate who doesnt dislike him now.   I dont think what Adam did was a nice thing or that it should really be commended. I just fully understand why he did it and think his anger is fully justified. I also think Upset is at fault and blaming Adam for posting this ignores the first half which would have prevented all of this in the first place.

hm8ow9k,FCalamity,11/26/2021,1,4457.0,Exactly. My take is that people including Upset are conflating its his right to prioritize his family and not share private info (true) with therefore he should be free of any negative consequences for doing so (false).  Given that he hasnt provided a full public explanation he should honestly count himself lucky that literally anyone in pro LoL is willing to work with him at all. Who wants to risk their chance at worlds on something-they-dont-even-know-what-it-is happening again? Upsets very good but hes not THAT good.  And speaking of its his right is it not also Adams right to discuss a situation publicly?

Nobody. Not the community not his teammates not even his boss.  Him not sharing does not give anyone the right to start making up rumours.  Your attitude is absolutely disgusting.
hm7pu0q,vegeful,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,If i screw up a big project and its hurt your company brand the less i can do is to be quiet and stay low. If management ask just say no opinion. At least your team deserve some mercy after the setback.  But he say Adam did not reach my ambition. This already make me dislike his personality. It come of as Jerk guy and very selfish.

hm72cip,Zerwurster,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,> but the guys who got him there deserve an explanation  Well they got it now if it wasnt communicated clearly before: Emergency in the family please respect my privacy.  Upset has been working closely for months with his teammates and still thinks he cant trust them with such sensitive details. Maybe they warrant this kind of mistrust? Like bwipo having no filter for sharing... well just about any kind of information or like adam being a heated defiant teenager?  They deserve more details! No they dont and their behavior shows as much.
hm80x1u,Kripperino_Pasterino,11/26/2021,1,110.0,> People just see the scoreline & think it was close.  Funnily enough you just seem to remeber the Fiora at the nexus instead of the rest of game 1 & 2.  >  KT vs IG was IGs closest series by far. I think IG stomped every other series.  The other poster is absolute right even if IG wouldve couldve 3-0 the games were way more competetive than FNCs or G2. Ive given up to argue whether that meant that KT was better than / would beat G2/FNC but I always disliked shrugging off KT having a competetive series with IG as 1 auto from 3-0
hm7uixu,Identical64,11/26/2021,1,1.0,Is this a case where you can provide evidence of the enemy team being ahead or close with bounties or is this anecdotal and you only think the game was close. Players aren’t the best at figuring out gold leads IMO.
hm7iy23,FauxMoGuy,11/26/2021,1,,yamato does and voiced his support of upset i consider coaches to be management even if they’re technically not  this is total speculation on my part but from reading into the information that’s come out upsets wife probably was having a very dark time that required his attention. if his wife likes playing league and wants to play some games with him you play games with her. it’s not about upset. he wasn’t grinding solo queue he was spending time with his wife

hm7cgwq,Rumbleinthejungle8,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,A family **emergency** is not something minor. The definition of an emergency is the complete opposite of something minor.   Why does it matter what the actual emergency is? I trust that it was a serious issue because it wasnt just Upset but Yammato and people from Fnatic management that agreed with him. Thats all that anyone needs to know. Who cares if its because his uncle is sick in the hospital or because his wife broke her leg?

hm7rrgi,Kurumi_Tokisaki,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Yeah some loud upset defenders seem to firmly believe management 100% did what’s needed but it seems the biggest issue was management not getting the message across  to players like Adam and Bwipo so that while it sucks ass for them at least they can be sorta understanding and maybe follow up on it when Adam dropped his twit
hm6y1u8,puma271,11/26/2021,1,74.0,Well ye dk wont get nuguri since he said he wont play maybe theshy but thats doubtfull +i wouldnt say theshy is s tier player - he had rather bad 2 years so he has to prove me wrong before i acknowaldge him  But ye geng isnt a super team they have s tier botlane and z tier mid but jungle and top are not regarded as s tier players  In fact i think that t1 is closer to super team than geng (although they arent one unless zeus and oner level up)

Technically there are some Chinese games that have more players but theyre almost exclusively played in China. League is played everywhere. And again your personal anecdotes are meaningless against the rising player count. Its not stagnant its increasing in every region including NA. The game is already part of the culture in places like China and Korea. Its not going anywhere. You dont have to like League maybe its not for you anymore. But that doesnt make it a bad game or the current direction of the game wrong.

hm701jx,puma271,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Well the only good way to handle it is to make your team feel that this was neccessary they didnt do that so they misshandled it - that seems clear - and obv everyone who doesnt fully trust upset (and upset doesnt fully trust them so it seems fair) felf like they werent  communicated clearly and was hurt - the only purpose of coaching and management staff in this case is to make the team feel the opposite... - there is no entitlement here 5 people have commuted entire year to one goal and one of them dodges with bearly any explanation - you do deserve some explenation if not from upset then at least coaching staff  management to rnsure that players understand the urgancy - and since they didnt either upset or management or coaching staff failed in passing info along

And seeing how bitter adam is about that alphari situation It was probably not insulting at all.

hm7ev62,edgelordweeb_,11/26/2021,1,97.0,I remember watching Big Brother for a few seasons and then it just got old. Everyone is trying to play themselves up to launch a post-Big Brother career and its kinda cringe. Its fun and funny for a while but after a few seasons I was so done man.
hm7g85h,Fgame,11/26/2021,1,1301.0,Like Ive said the rest of the teams anger is justified but taking it out on Upset is childish as fuck. Yamato knew what was going on and either a) didnt communicate to the team it was actually a serious issue or b) the team didnt care what Yamato said. Depending on which happened determines who really looks bad here. But Adam and Bwipo both look like stooges for insinuating Upset left worlds for a booty call or some shit.

hm7xxy1,vegeful,11/26/2021,1,,Make me realise the person you comment never face a corporate politic before. If he taste what Adam get i bet he sing a different tune.   Yes Upset deserve privacy but at least had some decency and moral. U already screw your team the least he can do is stay low and offer no comment on anything. Or at least protect your team. Not backstab them because Adam is below my standard.   If u are a normal guy its common sense to do that. Only asshole did what Upset did. Even if Upset had emergency the least he can do is be kind to his team.    In fact the cause and effect of Adam tweet is just because of Upset backstab. This tweet will never happen had Upset not backstab him.   If Adam an asshole and immature he will post it during world.

hm8k3yh,be_like_neo,11/26/2021,1,140.0,Can you elaborate your thoughts on jungle kayn? Im a jungle main and dont like playing against kayn at all but when I play him I feel like he doesnt have much impact compared to other junglers. For me it just comes down to how annoying he is but less of it determining the outcome of the game.
hm8s3gc,Xgunter,11/26/2021,1,12.0,Aram is all about braindead fighting for me i’d rather get one more teamfight and throw than hit the nexus and skip a fun teamfight. Winning or losing means nothing in that mode
hm6z6zq,f0xy713,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,It is absolutely within his rights but this is the kind of reason I would give to complete strangers (AKA my fans) not my teammates. The fact that you only trust a single teammate and your coach enough to disclose more details than family emergency seems kind of insane to me.  So yeah to me both sides are at fault here - Adam for lashing out and Upset for not being able to trust his teammates enough to give a better reason why hes ruining their chances at Worlds. Adam might never make Worlds again so its completely understandable that hes upset.  Hyli is a bro for not wanting to know the reason but hes also the best player on that lineup who already had good Worlds runs in his career so its probably not as big of a deal for him.

hm83qmc,Earth-Red,11/26/2021,1,291.0,Eune has just as much English speaking as euw. The Nordic countries for instance are faring a lot better in English than say France Germany or Spain.
hm8isy9,JukebocksTV,11/26/2021,1,26.0,Youre getting very emotional about this. The truth is you will probably never reach a high enough elo for any of this to matter to you.  It sounds to me like you lost one game to a vayne who got a lead and now your conclusion is that the champion is not balanced. This is not how high level players think.
hm6y29c,mi-0-0,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,So what does it indicate?
hm731az,CoogiMonster,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Fair enough. At the end of the day you can’t say a whole lot as management anyway.  Their hands are mostly tied because they have to respect players and so I trust the players takes on this a little more.  I’m also surprised how much these players don’t seem to like/trust each other.  I haven’t been on a team in anything sport related in a while but even the players I didn’t trust I respected enough to be upfront with them so from the jump this has all seemed odd.

hm8sbk4,De-Lit,11/26/2021,1,8.0,Ah yeah in that case I would go for the most expensive one as your free champ as it will save you time and materials as you play more. It might be one time but saving 7k essence now is a few levels later one when it takes a bit more time
hm7e32a,mrmorzan,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,From my perspective Adam Upset and Fnatic management all come off badly in this.  Adam made a post that directed angry fans toward upset and fueled speculation on a topic that was starting to die down.  Upset is either lying or terrible at communicating given that 3/4 of his teammates seem unhappy with how he handled his departure and how he acted after returning. Yes he was in an awful situation. Doesnt change the fact he is still partially responsible for anything that went wrong due to him being absent.   Fnatic management seems to be the only ones given full information and they failed to convey the seriousness of Upsets situation to the rest of the team.   Also informing Adam that Upset was involved in the recruiting process was incredibly stupid. Anyone should be able to see how awful it is from Adam and Nisqys perspective to have the person who was absent during worlds be responsible for deciding if they should be replaced. Either leave him out of the process entirely or keep the fact that he was involved under wraps.

Shaco taught me how to solo carry games and make myself the win con it also taught me how to adapt my build to suit my champion identity that game (assassin/dueler/zone control). Shaco also taught me how to think ahead to find a moment when the enemy either jgl or laner is vulnerable and exploit it.   Rek sai taught me how to gank correctly a lot of ganks are can result in nothing or only summs if your micro and champion tethering is sub-par.

hm76a9u,2poundWheel,11/26/2021,1,74.0,I genuinely dont believe Peanut deserved that award it was between him and Canyon and I having watched Nongshims games seemed to be more of the Gori show with Peanut being a supporting element.  Not to mention with the LCKs disgustingly bad jungle pool last split sure whatever he can be top3. But with T1 dissolving their junglers (Ellim/Cuzz moving to full-time spots on two teams) I doubt Peanut will be able to keep it up. If he does id be surprised if it isnt because now he has a godtier/Z tier midlaner (up from Gori being an S/S+ tier mid)  Id rate Bo Ellim Oner Canyon above him and Croco even. Cuzz on a good year is better than him Dread is an absolute paycheck stealer and Umti/Willer arent worth talking about (Umti has no teammates and Willer has only played for Summer+Worlds being thrown into an unfair situation to step up or die he deserves more time)

More just the situation itself. But no one is saying Adam shouldnt be annoyed or upset. Its about his response and views on it
hm84ck6,Ruesap,11/26/2021,1,,The team gambles on said player because they believe it will be their best option. If player wants to leave like Alphari did then Liquid only had to pay Alphari for 1 year and they were paid by Vit basically for what they paid Alphari so they end up playing with a player for free discounted or even a profit. As for the player for the money if they can get a long term contract they feel they will get paid for those 3 years. Job security.

hm8pem5,DogShroom,11/26/2021,1,13.0,I think 4 is intended. Viego possessing a body under tower doesn’t reset turret aggro on him. I’m pretty sure Akshan has the same problem as 1. It also seems like the exclamation mark is inconsistent and buggy starting from 11.23 (from my Akshan experience)

They start LoL look at the server names.  Toxicity is pretty much equal prolly heavier on EUW. But EUNE ranked is a joke. Anybody from there will drop a division coming EUW
hm73qi2,ASU_SexDevil,11/26/2021,1,22.0,Because if you sign a 3 year deal you’re going to get guaranteed income for the next 3 years. When players move teams the orgs have to buy out the rest of the contract with the player. If you sign 3 contracts in 3 splits you’re going to get 3 contracts worth of $$$ even if you only spend 1 split at a team the orgs have to pay up their end of the contract before it’s absolved and you can negotiate a new one... these aren’t transfer fees that clubs are pocketing
hm7rqua,uncertainrandompal,11/26/2021,1,124.0,single thing is like playing duo arams whole day as soon as he get back home?   shitty to simp with mental gymnastics like you instead of just looking at facts.
hm77ive,Halseyqueen,11/26/2021,1,51.0,Thank you veryy much <3 ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)
hm6zjsi,JealotGaming,11/26/2021,1,141.0,I really want the merger cause my friends play on EUW but most people I know play on EUNE and i really do not have the patience to have two different accounts for this...  Also because the malding that high elo players from EUW would do because of having to play with EUNE high elo
hm73u90,Drathmar,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,And people bashing him are trash. He doesnt need to share shit other than it was a serious family situation to anyone other than who he already did.   If a fan bashes him or especially his wife over that they are a piece of shit. Full stop. Just like Adam is for bringing her into it.   Also the removing teammates thing is bullshit Adam fans are reaching for to be pissed when he gave his opinion to managment which was already looking to replace the weakest player and a mediorce middle of the pack toplaner with someone better. Its esports that shit happens all the time and he sounded like a petulant child complaining about it.
hm8klzo,TheScyphozoa,11/26/2021,1,572.0,Yeah thats all.
hm739vr,ZXKeyr324XZ,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,He got very desperate towards the end when noone wanted to buy Rekkles I think he would eventually do it
hm8mme0,dartymissile,11/26/2021,1,2.0,I tried getting into the game but in bronze every team fight is either a slog of cc or you get insta killed. Everyone knows their combos and chains and every trick and trying to learn to play is a fucking waste of time because some dipshit on your team is just going to int into them anyways
hm79n8o,voluptuousshmutz,11/26/2021,1,86.0,Gamergate did directly lead to QAnon so it isnt unreasonable
hm8fn8o,SkeleknighX,11/26/2021,1,169.0,With respect I really don’t think this is true at all. It feels like ANYONE is capable of being better they just need the right resources (assuming everyone has access to a decent connection+computer which might be pretty presumptuous of me).  But with lots of time and the right learning mindset anyone can be at the top of the latter.
hm7zkue,John_Jack_Reed,11/26/2021,1,11.0,Tell me you went 0/9 and got mad when your team wanted to ff without telling me you went 0/9 and got mad when your team wanted to ff.
hm8ngu0,7StarsYoutubeMe,11/26/2021,1,175.0,I disagree with peoples advice that you can’t get get better while blaming team members. That shit happens in challenger daily. The real issues are probably 3 things. Mechanics macro and micro. Mental is overrated af by this sub (although I do think it help) if you’re good at mechanics and micro play with decent macro then you’re hitting diamond easily. He’s probably a shit tier farmer who plays 30+ champs a season dies 8+ a game and doesn’t play for objectives if he does get fed. Probably poor itemization too. I use to coach a lot and these were the biggest problems
hm758q2,Sincroz,11/26/2021,1,26.0,I dunno what is your problem tbh those are the results. Believe it or not i am just gonna stop speaking with you.

hm7xhna,No_Virtue,11/26/2021,1,,closing gold gap makes bounties disappear and champ bounties also dont have a time limit so 2 ways they work differently.
hm7jqmf,Ulyrres,11/26/2021,1,, “Also he says that he told Yamato what happened but from this video Yamato talks about Upset leaving. When talking about Upset leaving he said that he knows it must be super important because Upset is a competitor and would not give up and leave for nothing. If Yamato knew the reasons wouldn’t he be phrasing it as “Upset told why he considered leaving and I knew he needed to go home and deal with it.” Not to psycho analyze too much but it feels like Yamato doesn’t know much and is rationalizing that it must be super important because Upset wouldn’t just leave the team.”  From a comment earlier in this thread didn’t bother linking the video you can find it if you want. Someone who actually knew the reason would not have phrased it like that period. Its just backpedalling to cover for Upset because they are taking his side and he is the one continuing to play for them
hm8nfpz,Wrsow,11/26/2021,1,,Lets assume that someone does not like someone very much and I want to ban his account then he sent him a lot of gifts in this way and.. BAN. What in that case?
hm7h7cw,Lahwtiste,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,Oh yeah I never meant to imply youd take that away.    Its just that hes passionate for his team and usually a passionate owner translate into the team being a priority which can lead to good things.    If you look at team with passionate owners whether theyre a fucking douche or not those tends to have a large following.
hm8tq0f,MI8MarkusXx,11/26/2021,1,10.0,Sadly they got backdoored and lost
hm7mivl,FuujinSama,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,I was always hopeful about Adam maturing and at least starting to play normal champs before the meta turned. No Graves Awful Kennen at worlds is not legal and his Jayce was pretty terrible. And I understand that Upset was not there and everyone was tilted so Id 100% be all for Adam another year. Let him mature at FNC. Caps first split was pretty mild (much better than Adam imo but not *Caps*.)  However he always had a few takes that people found funny and I just found kinda disrespectful. Like how he didnt know the playoff format and thought they couldnt play finals. Or the multiple times he implied he didnt really care about preparation and just played his own game. It just stroke me as fairly immature and unprofessional.  And some pros are like that and its okay Im sure there are pros like that and they can be successful with the right team but I can also see how these things might rub players like Bwipo Hyli and Upset the wrong way. These are all players known for going very hard into preparation stats and the tactical side of the game and Adam gave the feeling that he just wanted to lock in a bruiser top and go at it.
hm7qtxh,DangerousSeaweed0,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,adam clowned on wunder for one.....so thats debatable.

hm6ywrl,Dreadedvegas,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Thats not even what the team was asking for he should have just told his teammates the situation.   The only reason this has blown up to the degree it has was because he told only the people he “trusts” leaving the rest of the team in the dark

hm8iash,AnonLXIX,11/26/2021,1,569.0,I am confused are there more changes on the way or is a couple rune changes a handful of items and 2 more drakes the WHOLE season 12 experience?
hm8tp7r,SpiralVortex,11/26/2021,1,20.0,Theres a lot of weird vision bugs going on ATM even for champs that dont have stealth in their kit at all.  Luxs E reveals her location (including FoW and brushes) but only if her E is actively on them. Like...how/why?  Seen multiple people mention bugs on Eve/Rengar/Pyke especially starting with pre-season. Hopefully a Rioter sees this vid and they can assign people to try fix these things. Its frustrating locating bugs writing up detailed reports on things you can replicate 100% of the time and months later the bugs persist because you werent lucky enough to get a Rioter on your reddit post that day.
hm76pgs,Vantablack9,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Yeah it seems like they werent clear enough about how Upset situation was justified and they were behind him. But if Fnatic was clear enough (which I doubt tbh) with everyone without revealing details then honestly looks pretty bad on Adams side.
hm8esi5,CuteLittleGirI,11/26/2021,1,169.0,He doesnt know how to improve. I had the same problem stuck in silver for years. How can you improve on something you dont know about? Like ask him if his favorite champion beats x champ in lane... if he has to think about it then thats the problem he should know that becuase he probably played the matchup over 100 times. He doesnt know he should know that (obviously anyone gonna say I should know that... but why didnt they)
hm8g3ff,rudebrooke,11/26/2021,1,20.0,I mean the players on CLGs 2021 werent good and lost their jobs as a result of that but management and coaching were worse and they also lost their jobs.   These are completely new staff who are already on record saying they arent going to make roster changes.
hm8io5w,BlankCartographer53,11/26/2021,1,6.0,These are incredibly detailed. Ive noticed the exclamation mark bug a lot and never thought of it as a visual bug.
hm8ihkq,Fluid_Highlight2035,11/26/2021,1,,Some of the scenes were so drawn out I had to skip forward. Like how many goddamn romantic scenes do we need of Jayce and that girl. I’m all for a thicker story but they needed to trim some of the fat out especially since we get to see it one year at a time…most of this stuff we already know as well. The last thing I want to watch again is Vi and Cait fucking talking about absolutely nothing for three episodes while we just get told over and over the arcane stuff is “dangerous” like no shit.
hm7i85w,Amsement,11/26/2021,1,144.0,I dont remember LS flat out saying he thinks Jensen is bad. Ive watched him comment on Jensens world performance and yes he has said that he doesnt think Jensen performed that well and played bad at times but didnt call him a bad player overall. From the several times hes talked about Jensen hes said that he thinks his worlds performance was overblown he wasnt impressed any of the times he watched his proview this year and that Jensens proview looked like someone just clocking in for work.  IIRC. his general impression was that he didnt think Jensens laning was good and that was a general reoccurring theme for western mid laners at that tournament. He also said based on watching Jensens play hes not really surprised that he doesnt have a team because he believes that there are other mid laners that could deliver the same performance for a cheaper price.
hm8domv,Xalidos,11/26/2021,1,152.0,and Hextech Mayhem is dumb amounts of fun for such a low price point.

hm7jwou,SoloJungleSenpai,11/26/2021,1,130.0,Hilarious experience lol. I guess instead of learning all that you should just focus on raw mechanics and matchups seeing the jungler approach with the ward helps so you can prepare yourself to win the 1v2 (in toplane that is mid is often more difficult as far as Im aware). Until high platinum (or beyond that even) the ganks are extremely uncoordinated
hm762we,MIRAGEone,11/26/2021,1,133.0,That was a good watch. Wing has impressive range but just an overall good performance.

hm6zei9,DragonApps,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,I love Adam? Fuck off with that. Idc about Fnatic or any of its players but if there isn’t a single person on that roster coach or otherwise coming forward to defend Upset then you can tell that Upset is in the wrong. But Upset had the most recent twitlonger so he has to be in the right right?
hm83kg2,LazerFruit,11/26/2021,1,13.0,2 games a week is equal 104 games in a year. You can pretty easily hit gold in that amount of games if your near that level and actually improving. Its even possible to hit plat provided your improving enough each game. However 104 is very few games and thats not taking into account that the ranked season doesnt last the whole year so realistically you have even fewer games and considering you are casual your probably not watching things like vods and high level streams so unless you are already at that level then its pretty unrealistic to climb much higher than what your current skill level would be
hm7cp2s,GiannisisMVP,11/26/2021,1,88.0,Yup the amount of straight up bullshit grifters have fed certain segments of the gaming community that they bed over backwards to defend is hilarious on both sides.

hm76tip,happygreenturtle,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,The problem is not that Upset didnt tell them what happened but that he apparently made no effort to help them understand on an emotional level where he was coming from. Its really cold to leave within a day of the most important tournament of the year and then not even speak to your team to repair the damage when you come back.  The way Adam wrote his comments was as though Upset said Sorry I have to be with my girlfriend left and then upon coming back made no effort to reconcile with the teammates he abandoned (even if for good reason) and actually attempted to replace them behind their backs as soon as whatever drama was happening in his personal life was dealt with. That is.. kind of messed up and honestly fuck players like that. They always cause more trouble than theyre worth
hm7f5sa,OP_IzzoR,11/26/2021,1,,The problem is even fnatics management failed to explain shit properly. Since 3 players are completely clueless why he left. And yes believe it or not you can explain things without revealing details if you have at least 2 iq which i guess they didnt have.
hm7m9g9,ComprehensiveBuy2759,11/26/2021,1,13.0,Cause they want to hit 10cs/min in silver/gold at least. LoL

hm7fqde,edgelordweeb_,11/26/2021,1,43.0,I dont think it was as bad for Jackey. He was at his best 2019 spring and 2020 spring and was still prob the best adc in the world in 2020 summer. TheShy fell off pretty fucking hard after 2019.
hm7sz0w,Tydrack7,11/26/2021,1,19.0,I dont hate when Junglers take my farm but i do hate when the only time they show up in your lane is to take farm thats infurating.
hm7469a,whydoyoureadnames,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,Yeah not how it works. If my wife got cancer I wouldn’t tell me coworkers I’d explain to my boss I have a family medical emergency and then my boss would handle it. I don’t think you understand that privacy on these matters is deserved and you aren’t obligated to share anything that deep with coworkers.

hm7me44,OppaiTaichou,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,youre just an idiot lol. is it that hard to tell someone you dont want to play with them anymore? lol.     cant be talking about winning and financial gain when you abandon a team 12hours before the start of the biggest tourney and at the same time plotting to replace one of your teammate without actually telling him in his face.
hm7uyxc,uncertainrandompal,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,yeah and also he said yamato knew it but yamato said he didn’t.  also said situation needed immediate reaction but played arams with his gf as soon as he arrived.   and someone like him telling other not meeting his expectations is beyond stupid. no wonder why 3/4 of team just left and sided with adam.
hm7mjs8,RevolutionaryBricks,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Bruh they went after LS’s grandma I’d say that’s significantly more effort than SO
hm78or6,rudebrooke,11/26/2021,1,22.0,So did Rekkles Nisqy Jensen and Mixky who arent in LEC/LCS this season as far as we know.   They can work for and against you.
hm72b79,Aeuce,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,This entire people are entitled to feel offended argument that some people are trying to push here seems very fucking stupid when you take into consideration the fact that the community wasnt interested in what happened to Upset until Adam made the twitlonger. Adam writing that frankly childish and unprofessional tweet spurred people to get mad about the situation and harass Upset and his wife.
hm7617d,Hrkeol,11/26/2021,1,42.0,And what does that has to do with the situation in hand? Youre still implying that this is the reason why Upset left with no evidence plus I think you need to have some specific information about the relationship to judge it and not just based on set in stone numbers and past experiences. getting married for a visa how do you know that? Your whole argument is based on believing that his wife is a bad person based partly on her past and the rest based on your own biases and manufacturing theories.

hm7sec0,IWouldLikeAName,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,And if you think Upset would leave worlds after trying so hard for years for something miniscule then youre beyond stupid.   Could Upset and FNC hace handled it better? Of course. But at the end of the day Adam is just being an immature teenager.   Being mad about the situation is completely normal. But hes overstepped his bounds.

hm7g9fw,Kaztiell,11/26/2021,1,1301.0,it is illegal to say some stuff Ive read people say about Upset / his girlfriend in some countries yes atleast in the country Im from. I guess youre from a country where its not illegal and tahts why you think its such a funny comment?

hm7ase2,lppur3ps3,11/26/2021,1,4457.0,But its not even about not wanting to divulge too much you shouldnt need to do that in any sense. The statement of a serious urgent family matter is more than enough. Usually that can mean Death extreme harm etc etc. It doesnt take a genius to conclude that. Its common.  He clearly didnt try? Says who. Being angry/Upset at the situation doesnt imply that at all. So people including bwipo in this .... I just dont know unless theres something I missed. So you have Adam and possibly Nisqy. Everyone else is either a ? Or disagrees.  Also companies are just as similar key stakeholder leaves due to that and a project cant go ahead and you lose A LOT and possibly your job? Very similar. But we have a level of decency that if they have to leave for a seriously urgent matter and others who do know have said yeah. (Such as the coach etc) then thats not for me to question let alone making a post flaming him publically and now getting hate toward him and family lmfao.  I dont care if its worlds or something greater urgent family matters come first and you have no right to know unless you are the employer just trying to verify if its true. Simple as.
hm7xezc,Axendil,11/26/2021,1,1.0,I guess you can always look at the patch notes which Im fairly sure are accessible but I literally never look at them myself so maybe it would be a good idea to make it more obvious

hm7rjty,sanketower,11/26/2021,1,252.0,Forget EU. LAN and LAS need to be merged. Peru is entirely divided because of that. Its so frustrating to meet someone who plays LoL but you cant play with them cuz theyre on LAN and you on LAS.
hm71ooq,Daimonfire,11/26/2021,1,133.0,Can I say I absolutely love Acapella. Here is no exception. This was absolutely wonderful. I just dont think the mood captured here fits the show/opening.
hm8erbr,hpl2000,11/26/2021,1,121.0,Maybe in iron. Above that people at least have a basic idea of the game in my experience. Idk I don’t touch ranked it’s the shittiest game mode plus I’d probably get banned for the champs I play lol.
hm7ovaq,teerude,11/26/2021,1,,I hope this thread stays that way and this remains the top comment.
hm721li,TuffPeen,11/26/2021,1,16.0,Juggernauts like mord Darius aatrox are literally built around doing this
hm7okrs,BulletCola,11/26/2021,1,551.0,No it was rather because it was basically ADC Udyr which to them was rather boring.  So they decided to redo the concept and BAM Aphelios was made.

hm7ai63,hutre,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,From what Nisqy/Bwipo/Adams POV it doesnt seem like they got that though. No sorry but I am dealing with severe and serious family emergency. He just left without saying anything.
hm75fau,nncoma,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,People at Latin American are laughing at this situation. Everyone knows what kind of person she is
hm7brf1,Barfmeister,11/26/2021,1,1095.0,Its definitely not the only thing that makes any sense. For example my most likely interpretation is that he feels the details are not actually for him to divulge because the tragedy happened primarily to his wife and he is protecting her privacy not just his own.

hm7uplu,Poluact,11/26/2021,1,252.0,Not really. If it was something short and simple I could suppose it was a coincidence. With the word like this chances are much much lower.
hm758uf,Kentori,11/26/2021,1,73.0,Yeah he’s going to be the head coach of GEN G
hm767bv,Haymegle,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Its only a problem if its a team game and youre supposed to be communicating with them and you just have your conversation when you could be passing on info. Or youre passing on the info but in French when from the VC everyone else is using English.   Basically so long as youre playing and communicating properly most people wont care if youre talking with your friend in French.
hm750uk,Suspicious-Bus6351,11/26/2021,1,73.0,Hes the new head coach of GENG.
hm7atkj,jaguar317,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,Yeah I agree. Its not like I dont feel bad for Adam. This guy just reached the pinnacle of his career and it ended in disaster. But his hotheaded Twitlonger was a really messed up move. Hes only a kid so I understand why he would have done that but that doesnt absolve him from responsibility.
hm7mh8y,Elibu,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Upset didnt look to kick him.
hm7327o,mistood,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Upset meets a camgirl/onlyfans girls who lives in South America online dates her for 2 months and decides to marry her. This is her 3rd marriage and she even has nudes available online. You can tell from her social media that she has many red flags.        Upset makes the judgement to commit to this used-up cam thot marrying her after only 2 months of dating. You think he is someone who makes smart and sensible decisions?
hm75omn,azulu701,11/26/2021,1,85.0,Not the new stuff
hm8b4yo,LeagueReddit00,11/26/2021,1,180.0,It certainly isnt that bad in the context of gaining an advantage in video games. There are of course times when ddos is something that causes actual harm but a hit to a virtual rank in a game does not register even a tiny bit as something that would get you prison time.
hm7jy6u,Jiffyyy,11/26/2021,1,92.0,well there is a limit to sick/emergency days you can take and if its an extended period of time you need off that exceeds what you are entitled to a year they may ask for it.   but anything within reasonable limits (I.E your days you are entitled to each year to take off) the employer cant ask for information on.
hm7eqau,Odd_Play_5769,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,Were dealing in abstract language so if we wanted to define teammate seriously we would need to go a whole Socrates discourse to define terms and what they mean and argue to prove our point. We wont go yhrough that but instead I will say:  Coworkers work together for a company.  Teams work for q company their work is practicing together in a highly coordinated function with the end goal of competition directly against other teams. This direcr competition against other teams adds an entirely new element to the coworker dynamic that makes it something deeper new and different.  Obviously Upset saw them as coworkers and not teammates. Thats fine. But actually at the heart of the drama in the community is this distinction of language between teammate and coworker.
hm7wg3s,Radriark_,11/26/2021,1,7.0,600 games is nothing.
hm768in,HowTooPlay,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,How does it contradict it? He gave them a general(generic?) statement on what was currently happening BUT he doesnt trust them enough to provide more details than it being severe family issues.
hm7nsi6,NocaNoha,11/26/2021,1,225.0,its fun to think of alternatives

hm8qhbp,JakobTheOne,11/26/2021,1,128.0,Because you can get guaranteed money that will drastically increase your chance of being financially secure for the a large majority/rest of your life. Put a 1 year contract for 1.5m or a 3 year contract for 4.5m on the table which are *you* going to pick?

hm8kic8,Acegickmo,11/26/2021,1,8.0,this is literally just a bug that makes their skin bios work as search terms. The same thing used to or still happens with resistance jayce I think
hm7b04r,TheGawringSame,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,Thats still full bullshit.  How hard is it to say: A family member I was very close with had died or something. He didnt need to be specific. It would violate literally nobodys privacy when you dont mention any names dont mention genders or any sort of description as to who youre talking about.  You can even omit more details. You can say: someone I was close to passed away or was very sick. It would completely justify him leaving everybody would understand nobodys privacy would be violated. Nobody would have any fucking clue who he would be talking about and most people wouldnt care either. All theyd hear was that someone close had issues and he was a good person and went to support them. Acceptable.  Like holy shit Upset has to be the smallest brained individual on the god damn planet if he doesnt know how to communicate a serious situation without specifically mentioning someone that could be identified.   Its just crazy.
hm7zxnz,byeolToT,11/26/2021,1,21.0,I would love to See how viktor transforms into the viktor we have in game and how He builds Blitzcrank. Also some Champions in general even if they are just in the background or something like that

hm7u9n5,PorkChopALaMolotov,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,>So yes we can respect not feeling good or family emergency but it does raise some eyebrows and if you want to keep it private you need to do it in a way that comes off sincere to the people who put their trust in you.  The org and the coach who knew more chose to trust him and bet on him again this year. Hilly chose to blindly trust him.   Its a few people who think they should have been told more because *they* dont trust everyone else judgment.   And its their right to do so and choose not to work with them again but taking things to the public wont ever help.
hm6ymhr,Neestz,11/26/2021,1,8.0,If someone flames me while i have said nothing i dont want them to know they are being ignored 100%. Let them flame as long as they flame and think they are being heard theres less of a chance theyre going to int/run it down mid. And also...  its just more satisfying knowing they are screaming at you while your ears are plugged <3
hm732mt,kazuyaminegishi,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,What they mean is likely hey man I agree with him and I like his joke so maybe you shouldnt criticize it and call it what it is cause that unsettles me. Especially when their other comment is just describing sarcasm something that isnt French specific...
hm79zzv,Conker184,11/26/2021,1,84.0,Im sure the players care a fair bit about it but you cant seriously compare these results with any domestic league and MSI/Worlds when its a 3 day tournament with a bunch of random Bo1s with different teams strung together parading as an overall Bo5 you cant exactly view a team/player performance based on the region results when they only get to play a few games for instance 2017 all 3 of SKT/SSG/KT finished 2-1 but they were runner ups b/c you only guarantee a single Bo1 in the final per team and they had the crutch that was MVP that year
hm7g4aw,Elhak,11/26/2021,1,,There are plenty of things that I wouldnt want the rest of the world to hear about that are really serious and would still warrant going home especially anything that would hurt a family members reputation. Off the top of my head I can think of parents having a horribly messy divorce that you must be involved in a sibling being suicidal / unstable your wife has a stalker/ex who is actively making legitimate threats to her safety your partner having miscarriage... dont forget that if whoever is at the center of the reason he had to return home will get harassed endlessly by fans for being the reason the team failed.   Not every emergency is blameless and personally Id never want to subject someone I love to the wrath of thousands of people saying horrible things no matter what they did. I think people really need to have some empathy and also understand the consequences that come from making an actively difficult situation public.
hm8nxzc,aglimmerof,11/26/2021,1,11.0,Shockingly the people who are vocal about their dislike for the game are _actually the minority_ and most of us enjoy the game.
hm8s1rn,Ecstatic_Wedding7040,11/26/2021,1,84.0,Nah people are just trying to make the narrative this way. But really it was just Vi hitting on Cait the whole time. Cait herself never had undeniable proof she liked Vi like that. But shippers will ship anyways

hm8avez,EmilianoR24,11/26/2021,1,7.0,I still think we have better items now at least they feel impactful. before it was just the same but you have more stats now you have way more interesting options.  90% of the time you where building your same 2 core items every game just like you do now so dont pretend the mythics actually changed anything

hm75gfv,Farranor,11/26/2021,1,51.0,I havent seen Arcane - do the characters just wear normal street clothes instead of their signature outfits from LoL?
hm8jnxn,Zophixious_,11/26/2021,1,12350.0,Happy I watched this not knowing a thing about LoL because I thought anyone could die at any given moment. Apparently a lot of the characters are in-game champions that were unlikely to be killed off. But... now that I know that I guess that ignorance for the second season wont be there. Whoops.
hm8ek0v,tanezuki,11/26/2021,1,11.0,The thing is if any skirmisher attempts to use shieldbow theyll be given the entire items value the lifesteal isnt locked to be available to ADCs only.   Like imagine if shieldbows lifesteal would be dependant on being a ranged champion. Thats the similarity here.
hm6z6fs,isle99,11/26/2021,1,141.0,That one got moved iirc.

hm82cok,Buroth,11/26/2021,1,277.0,Unfortunately there isnt much that you can do since the routing mentioned is between your ISP and riot servers and depending on where you live it can be even multiple different ISPs from multiple different countries.
hm70x5t,lboms1,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,not sure what you mean about yours since i dont actively participate in any community thankfully  didnt know the comments on twitter were made by redditors or the ones by KC owner or coach as well. thats interesting!

hm7p4zl,KawaiiMajinken,11/26/2021,1,89.0,Sometimes I wonder how well off are some people on reddit because damn they make money sound like a non issue.  > Imagine taking money when you could work for 1/10th of your new offer?  Reddit probably.
hm7tgy6,Ok-Travel-7875,11/26/2021,1,161.0,The reason is going to come down to money at the end of the day. Last I remember he got an extension of 4.2m for 3 years. Who would want to pick up a $1m+ contract per year even if the buyout is $0 for a single player that realistically isnt going to push your team over the edge to suddenly become super good. Jensen isnt Showmaker or Chovy or something. Hes a better Powerofevil. I dont really blame teams for not caring to spend that much on him.
hm70fb9,CyberScrubReddit,11/26/2021,1,161.0,It’s more for seeing the area it’s in to see if you’ve actually sweeped everything in the drake pit or jgl

hm7ly1x,DangerousSeaweed0,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,i disagree. fucking with someones livelyhood is exactly the most entitled reason to get pissed at someone  consideringg how short careers are in esports.  as it stands  to me personally  this looks like upset knew that those players wont be on fnc next split  so he didnt wanted them to have info that they could use to shittalk him when they are thrown of the team  even more so if he had a hand in replacing them
hm8amki,NaranPol,11/26/2021,1,16.0,Yeah CLG hate is at full steam these days so I dont think so (Just look at your other reply. I dont even get what its supposed to mean lol). Beating the shit out of a dead horse in hope of some easy attention clearly takes priority over supporting the region.   Regardless of all the braindead takes Ive heard this last year Greg Kims plan has looked super smart so far so Im really happy with our offseason. Hope the org stays communicative through the split and we as fans we can understand the roster we are fielding support it and watch it grow.
hm7m55q,RemoteAnalysis3809,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,But would you still be fine with it if somehow your traumatic experience that you told your coworker in detail about made it to the front page of this subreddit ready to be dissected memed and joked about by 16yo league players?
hm7gj95,Xyexs,11/26/2021,1,184.0,As a person from Sweden its always weird to me how everyone I know plays on euw. We are defaulted to eune and years ago I knew a few that still played there.

Oh and also hope they dont leak it to the 5 million people on this sub.   Adam himself said he dont give a f about Upsets privacy.   This sub thinks pros are supposed to be non humans who are willing to prioritize this game and your coworkers over everything else including the sanity health and privacy of your loved ones.  No wonder this community is widely considered the most toxic among pretty much all the games out there.

hm71wuh,Dry-Place-2986,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Take a look at [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fnatic/comments/q9ji9l/upset_playing_soloq/). Not that this justifies anything. I dont know why Redditors want people to be miserable. Just because something terrible happens in your life doesnt mean you should drop everything to cry and grieve. In fact its great to have stuff like video games as a coping mechanism during trying times.

hm74jmc,swellbaby,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,There are people everywhere in the world who have little going on their lives and they handle that in some of the worse ways - by attaching themselves to something far greater than themselves. It happens with everything: political causes celebrities sports media literature hobbies whathaveyou. Easy access to echo chambers is some of the worst things internet gives society since it enables it and social media actually encourages it. Northern Europe is a tad more ambient when it comes to the mood of the masses and the amount of people compares to a handful of Southern cities but Im sure youd easily find some Swedes pulling this shit as well. Just the way some people are.

hm7aycg,lppur3ps3,11/26/2021,1,4457.0,Its really barely any bigger. A lot of co-workers see each other 5 days a week 8 hours a day in teams of less than 10. You do know people on teams a lot of times have no interest in actually liking each other or wanting to be friends too. And either way the level this matter is at is so high that even if theyre more than a team it still wouldnt fucking matter lmao.

hm7tvcg,TheDiabeticGM,11/26/2021,1,68.0,Now thats a huge part of it. I dont think that Silco didnt genuinely care for Jinx. The issue is that Silco is a bad man and even when he is trying to care for somebody he will still twist and manipulate them to do what he wants because he knows whats best. And thats how abusers work. And thats why its such good writing. Because they show all of that all fifty billion different shades of this very complicated and nuanced relationship. The more I think about it the more I am happy to overlook the couple of sloppier and tropier things going on with the show and hop aboard the Its A Mastahpiece! bandwagon lol. It is NUTS how much they can fit into a mere nine episodes.

hm7o843,firechaox,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,What hes saying is that what he was told is an unjustified reason (girlfriend is upset) and that until hes told the real reason its what hes going to run with. Real reason could be something super serious happened it doesnt need more details but he wasnt told a thing. Seems like communication is the problem when 3 out of 5 in your team sort of feel like this.
hm7mil1,Elibu,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Upset didnt look to kick him.

hm8msxb,FiraGhain,11/26/2021,1,191.0,Why would Jensen want to take a paycut? Especially to a team that probably wouldnt even be competitive? If no deal happens he sits on a bench collecting the easiest million dollars of his life. He might prefer to compete given the chance but outside of the usual big spenders nobody wants to shell out that much on a single player. He isnt by far the best mid - and by that I mean the gap between him and an average cheap mid is not too vast or insurmountable. Far more economic to split that pay across a team of above average players and hope they develop into star players.

hm7cegm,ezprodigy,11/26/2021,1,157.0,have people advocating for the merging of servers actually played games like that before? Dota 2 have different servers too but no region lock so you can play on whatever server you want and as a result both NA and EU are fucking horrifying every other game is 4 peruvians or 4 russians on your team screaming in their own language and communication is basically 0 people think its just gonna be oh I can play with my friend who goes on a different server more are in for a rude awakening if this actually happens.  Its funny how in Dota 2 people are begging for region lock so you actually only match people in your region whereas here people actually think everybody in eastern Europe is gonna speak English and nothings gonna happen
hm7we28,NotAnAce69,11/26/2021,1,156.0,I found a couple of Youtubers (most Saber) that really taught me a lot of things but a lot of it just came down to making sure that everything that you did had a purpose. Does shoving this wave has a purpose? If Im stuck sitting around waiting for the wave what can I do in the meantime? Establish vision steal my junglers raptors maybe set up a kill bush with my support? Which side of the map should I be setting up shop on depending on whether or not its baron or dragon spawning next?  Just whatever you do DO NOT RAGE. In fact for the purposes of improvement (people are going to hate this) dont ever surrender. The game might be lost you might be the only eukaryotic organism on the map but learning how to play from behind and how to flip a game on its head with that one big risky move will in the short term win you a couple of improbable victories and in the long term allow you to improve (especially in bronze people throw all the time because they 4fun fountain dive only to lost a 40 minute slugfest).

hm753ri,Miyaor,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,If three people on the team felt like they didnt get enough they probably werent conveyed how serious it was. Need to communicate better when you fuck your team over. Upset was right to leave but he was wrong in how he communicated.  Notice how the people he communicated with didnt complain.
hm76eku,happygreenturtle,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,No I dont agree at all. I personally couldnt care less whether I know about Upsets situation and given how private is apparently is I wouldnt want to know.   The problem that I do have with all of this is not even that Upset didnt tell his teammates what happened but that he apparently made no effort to help them understand on an emotional level where he was coming from. Its really cold to leave within a day of the most important tournament of the year and then not even speak to your team to repair the damage when you come back. From Bwipos comments Upset *didnt even speak to his team at all about it before he left*. Bwipo was made aware by somebody else in the organisation that Upset would be going home. 12 hours before the first game.  The way Adam writes this is as though Upset/FNC said Sorry I have to be with my girlfriend left and then upon coming back made no effort to reconcile with the teammates he abandoned (even if for good reason) and actually attempted to replace them behind their backs as soon as whatever drama was happening in his personal life was dealt with. That is.. kind of messed up

hm8qsj5,Bobandjim12602,11/26/2021,1,48.0,Yeah they ruined Jinx for you. Personally I prefer the Arcane version. Shes definitely not the PG I love blowing up shit for the Lulz shes far more terrifying and sad in this rendition. An actual psychopath. Personally I think the show will transform her from her current chaotic evil self to her far less depressing chaotic neutral self featured in the game. She just needs to go through the character arc that gets her there. Arcane is all around far darker than the game itself. So its possible that shell never become the PG Jinx from the game but well have to wait and see.
hm77ovn,2poundWheel,11/26/2021,1,74.0,Kiin  Rascal (If he plays even close to his level in Spring)  Zeus  Doran/Kingen/Canna  Sword/Dove  No Damwon toplaner or HLE toplaner listed HLE will probably be a rookie tho.

hm7dodo,DatDesolationDoh,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,Yeah this. It’s so easy to stay vague but still show some respect to your teammates.

The implication being that as he wasn’t kicked out he must have given a proper explanation?  I’d also like to re-emphasise that my example would be the same whether it was the quietest time of the year or the busiest. Life doesn’t stop happening when you hit critical moments at work.  Equally if my colleagues who were left working after I’d left threw a fit and sulked rather than professionally doing their best *they* would be the ones more likely to be forced out for a lack of professionalism.

After traveling to a new and undiscovered planet with his intrepid crew hew befriended a stray alien meep that became his assistant and ally in exploring the galaxy. Together they fly holding off the encroaching invasion of evil purple meeps that ***threaten the cosmos***.  Edit: On further investigation it appears to just be the latest Astronaut skins whose search queries will look into their Skin Bios.
hm70bli,Caenen_,11/26/2021,1,51.0,Vanish doesnt exist its a fancy name we have on the wiki so the concept of going untargetable and hiding your character and their stuff (VFX health bar) from the renderer is more accessible. Its just untargetability most of the time with a missile pop as usual.  You might want to check if the blades get popped by Yuumi W or Poppy R (on enemy) aswell. Those dont pop incoming missiles. Are you saying the missiles visually disappear but they keep going anyway?

hm7plzm,fornostalone,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,You can trust people within a team to do the necessary things to win but not trust them as people outside the game/team.   Bwipo has proven to be an emotional person prone to talking publicly about things he shouldnt repeatedly.  Upset had known Adam for what a year? I wouldnt trust a coworker of a year with the secrets of my family let alone one that (after the fact) has again proven himself to be an emotional person.   Even if they dont leak the information immediately people will continue to ask them what happened to that worlds run. They go to a new team people ask wtf was up. They hint and allude and eventually people piece together the story and it leaks out.   Upset handedly his family secrets completely correctly in my opinion but him & FNC management should have prepared for the worst earlier and split scrim time with Bean from the outset.
hm735bb,whimsicalokapi,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,The thing about it not being legal was actually something Adam himself said in his post. It couldve been a poor translation (he wrote it in both French and English so I wouldnt be surprised if his English word choice isnt quite as precise) but that was definitely the word he used.

hm7vke7,vegeful,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,His point is that if u truly have emergency try to act like ur emergency is important. Try play in alt account not playing on account that is easily being recognize. He should know what controversy will happen because of that. Hell at least play another game that is not league or alt account that nobody know.   Its like telling you mother that u sick and u really are sick. Then u proceed to play game for 10 hour openly in front of your mother.   My point is if u playing league or any game that fine but can u at least cover it up. He love privacy but cant keep his activity during world private?    Trust are earn and not given by playing league during world u actually reduce the team trust of your family emergency. If he cant trust his team dont expect your team to given u trust blindly either.   Instead of trust it bring a lot of speculation on the severity of the emergency.

hm74zbr,baburu12,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,>Over the course of two weeks there were two meetings where I had expressed to the team that I was dealing with severe family issues that have impacted me deeply   which then begs the question why didnt bean get any split scrim time in those two weeks. In any company if you tell someone two weeks before the project is due that you are dealing with severe issues at home management either gives you a backup coworker or replaces you from the project because the company cant risk a project failing completely because of your issues. either fnatic coaching and management is kinda incompetent or he didnt express the issue as clearly to everyone given that all other players so far mentioned they only found out the night before.  The fact that the whole team knew two weeks prior to him leaving that he has severe issues at home put the coaching and management of fnatic in a very bad light and splits the responsibility between them and upset. As manager or coach you have to make sure that the team succeeds regardless of the issues of only one player. Any responsible coaching staff or management would have given bean some scrim time as a backup measure.  Truth be told this confirms one of my strong suspicions which has been downvoted into oblivion that the issue at home wasnt quite out of the blue and that fnatic knew about it before worlds started given that the only substitute player they brought to worlds was an adc substitute which at the time didnt make any sense since botlane was the strongest fnatic lane and the sub should be for one of the weaker roles most likely mid or topside or if fnatic managements knew about bwipos gf issue for the jungler role. Which makes the situation look even more mindblowingly incompetent from a management position: you know one of your top players has severe issues at home and can leave at any moment you bring a replacement for him but you never give the replacement any time with the team? Like wtf. Bean started looking good starting in the second worlds game. Maybe with appropriate scrim time fnatics situation at words could have looked differently.

hm7g8ds,kazuyaminegishi,11/26/2021,1,1301.0,Dodge what point? The point that you accused me of saying something I didnt?  You: Quebec is one of the most left-wing places in Canada  Me: I dont know anything about French-Canadian policy.  Sounds like youve just created a boogeyman out of something I didnt say.
hm8q6x2,ThisIsMyBFG,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,pretty sure r/summonerschool still exists. great for new players.
hm7hqoi,RandomGuy928,11/26/2021,1,120.0,This is such nonsense. Without replays I would conclude that the only thing I can ever do in any game is hide under my turret because any interaction with enemy champions results in them having better mechanics than me and me dying.
hm7bplz,thrownawayzs,11/26/2021,1,7.0,its basically the whim of the designer and coding on whether or not.
hm747qf,fruxzak,11/26/2021,1,62.0,That’s just preseason stats
hm7ojk0,IWouldLikeAName,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Because if you look at it objectively Upset initiated nothing. He knows Alphari so Alphari went to him personally about FNC and they also asked him about his thoughts on Alphari.
hm8i101,chinomaster182,11/26/2021,1,118.0,Streaming is so lucrative it should make up most of the difference if you put some effort into it.  Its pretty much a no brainer to sign a huge fat contract its what you work your whole career to get to like winning your own personal worlds.
hm7cyr3,3IC3,11/26/2021,1,145.0,Also to Tibbers and also don’t do it during a fight
hm7zzja,MartDiamond,11/26/2021,1,21.0,Wasnt really hinted as a national thing but more of a familial thing that spilled over from her brother doing something. So theres no real indication of this being a Demacia thing and much more likely an internal Noxian affair which is known to be cutthroat itself.
hm7ewmb,Dec111819,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,Add to that the pEople are InSanE to ask him to reveal it!.  No. Nobodys asking Upset to reveal it to the public I have no idea why this is even a talking point.   What people *are* saying is that Upset leaving and giving an excuse that a majority (3/5) of the team feels is totally inadequate is the problem.
hm8n5gd,lilly_belle,11/26/2021,1,5.0,I would suggest for you to visit this site:  https://map.leagueoflegends.com/en_US  Easy to navigate and you can learn lots of things about the lore of league.

hm7mu45,Migraine-,11/26/2021,1,92.0,>I personally feel a Profesional team with a multi-million dollars budget investors sponsors and a huge fan base and media coverage to not behave like a close-knit team  The investors might not. But we arent talking about the investors were talking about his team-mates.  > with maybe one of the worst medical systems in western Europe...  Whats that got to do with literally anything? You think the NHS is struggling because the staff treat each other like human beings and have some empathy or what?
hm83uhj,Mazsi1201,11/26/2021,1,3.0,If you want to gain XP youll need to queue for COOP vs AI this will match you with supposedly 4 other real players on your team against 5 enemy bots. In reality a lot of the people playing this gamemode are just bots that are used to level accounts (to be sold later) so a lot of the times it will just be like 3 bots on your team against 5 bots on the enemy team. You can also just create a custom game where you can add as many bots to either team as you like (up to a maximum of 5 total players ofcourse) so you can play with 4 bots on your team against 5 enemy bots (but you can do fun challanges as well like 1 v 5ing bots and such. These become trivial after a certain point but if you just started they might be interesting). But keep in mind that you dont get any XP for custom games (which you need to level your account up to recieve resources to get new champions as well as new summoner spells and gamemodes)
hm7w6ir,bearugh,11/26/2021,1,3.0,Id argue zigs apc is gonna get plenty of resources via his W and towers so why not enable karma

hm7m6yc,Spitfire836,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,My personal views on them are irrelevant. Even if I don’t think Doublelift is a celebrity he still is. Millions of people still watch and follow League esports and when millions of people follow you then you lose privacy. It’s just something that happens. Same reason why “normal” celebrities have no privacy either.
hm7fhs2,Vangorf,11/26/2021,1,,Well one could argue Adam has a looooooooooooooooooong way ahead of him plenty of scaling meanwhile Alphari is a known quantity. Its like how FNC gave prio to Bwipo instead of Soaz after Bwipo had to sub in cuz Soaz broke his hand (iirc but only 99% sure on the reason he had to be put on the bench).  It would be totally sensible for FNC to stick with a very very promising young rookie. Look what happened with Bwipo and Caps. Especially after all this shit they put him through (you cant deny that either Upset or FNC management gigafucked up the communication initially). Having some discretion and good will towards your promising rookie after such an incident is the bare minimum imo.
hm85zdu,mazrrim,11/26/2021,1,92.0,Every role has harder and easier champions support has few extremely high skill cap ones but that doesnt make the average player much different.   Seraphine is all skillshots apart from a high CD shield obviously more to keep track of than Annie or twisted fate even. But because one is a support role (and frankly because one is a cute aesthetic character) its considered mechanically easy by people who have never played the role.  It only becomes a gap in role skill in extremely few picks like Akali or azir but 99.999% of the people calling support easy cant play those champion at a master+ level either
hm7nrzf,Mecketh,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,In my personal opinion this is something personal for Upset and his wife but that would not be acceptable for his teammates AND fans. Probably something that has no paper trail so he cant just state health/mental issues because he would be proved a liar.   Most personal problems can be resumed in a short way without affecting his privacy and of his family. Health/mental issues in my family is enough to cover almost every single thing and I dont think anyone would complain.   But Fanatic thinks is enough and did not fire him. Why would they fire their star ADC that they base the team on? The worst that can happen to them is some bad PR that can be dismissed easily (we just respected the player and his mental). Its not like fans would care enough after a couple of months.
hm7t10u,leagueoflegendsdog,11/26/2021,1,252.0,How do you fix that? I have really good internet but cant get lower than 35ms
hm8rju6,daddymateriial,11/26/2021,1,8.0,ive been playing this game for 10 years pretty sure i know what im talking about and every high elo top lane agrees
hm7p5hd,Migraine-,11/26/2021,1,,The point was never really about management youve kind of tried to lead everything off on a tangent.  The point was about how his teammates have acted.  But to address your point yes I think employees should be treated with empathy and the assumption of honesty until they prove themselves unworthy of deserving that. I dont think anyone should be asked to show their fucking relatives death certificate to some manager.
hm7mnbn,ok99988,11/26/2021,1,555.0,Does anyone know when the gifting center will be back up? Or how long fixing things like this usually takes? My girlfriend wants the evelynn squink in tft but the gifting center has been down for a bit and she cant exactly afford it rn

hm8r8wm,De-Lit,11/26/2021,1,8.0,If you plan on getting in to the game and playing more than just a little while the arcane fad then go for the most expensive on for your free champion.  If you aren super sure and just want to try it and see if youll get in to it then check out what your different options are and their champion spotlights to pick one.
hm78cwa,Risicoco,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Why do you say Bwipo is on their side. All we know is that Bwipo was frustrated about the situation but he never blamed or doubted Upset.

hm7nhku,SituationGood922,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,yes the trust goes both ways. people are saying that obviously Upset cant trust 20 year olds hes only known for half a year well the same is true in reverse? how can his topside trust that this 20 year old theyve only known for half a year has left for a reason they would sympathize with?  the argument is that of course Upset left for a good reason out of his control worlds is his dream! no it could be some scandal with his wife especially given her history. it could be that Upsets fifth cousin is in the hospital. it could be that Upset himself fucked up a signature on their home lease and he needs to go back or theyll be evicted.  if Upset considers these things to warrant his return thats his choice. but I can totally see why Bwipo and Adam and Nisqy might not view Upset as the poor unfortunate guy in these three scenarios. I dont mean to speculate but some people legitimately cannot fathom that there are controversial scenarios.
hm89t32,gigZ2g,11/26/2021,1,3.0,I did everything yesterday. Spammed through the text boxes so no idea whats it about and got 9 rewards. Think these are all.
hm7b7th,Agreeable_Junket_271,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,No one disagrees that Upset considers it an emergency.  The contention is centered around the fact that the very thing that he considers an emergency may not be what his teammates or indeed the average person would consider a moral justification to leave the team like he did.  Do you personally believe that it is 100% of the time morally justifiable to do something that (intentionally or not) harms other people on the basis that you are responding to an event that you personally consider an emergency regardless of what the actual contents of that event are?
hm8amua,AshesOntheFire778,11/26/2021,1,51.0,Yea unfortunately low elo has too much uncoordination and no cooperation which makes nasus thrives very well in this situation. An advice for you Op try to learn some mages at mid lane they have good range and cc to counter Nasus. Most assassins arent great against Nasus.
hm8mjnn,J-Colio,11/26/2021,1,5.0,Does that timer on the map break tos?
hm6yn1j,TH3RM4L33,11/26/2021,1,51.0,Many people probably did but if I cant show a reliable way to reproduce it then theres no point adding it. At least Riot knows themselves that the ability isnt perfect yet. Anyway its too late now I cant edit the video. But thanks.
hm8rwym,zer0-_,11/26/2021,1,320.0,Im sad that the EUW server isnt in Frankfurt.   In Valorant i have 10ms to Frankfurt servers and in League I have to play on 18ms and sometimes 23ms. Doesnt make a huge difference but I dont see why EUW would be in Rotterdam

hm8i18a,FatPigsExtreme,11/26/2021,1,116.0,IG was 2 auto attacks away from 3-0ing KT. The only reason IG lost game 4 was because IG’s coach got mad at TheShy and subbed him out. The result may have been close but one team was clearly better than the other
hm74hwi,FutureDrHowser,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,Literally not true lol. Go to kiwifarm or something like that then tell me how twitter is the worst site on the internet.
hm7lvt3,Jeremy64vg,11/26/2021,1,148.0,basically knight was offered more money then the LPL pay cap. So basically there is a limit as to what LPL can offer players and if the contract is above that it can be shut down
hm84f83,Dvscape,11/26/2021,1,159.0,But arent Diamond players roughly 1-2% of the ranked population? If you factor in players who dont even touch ranked this percentage becomes even smaller. If Diamond rank is your threshold for players who truly want to improve & win then 20% is way too generous of a share.
hm8elrp,barub,11/26/2021,1,118.0,Now im interested in knowing how can I help my jg without being a nuisance or falling too behind. I wanna try it in my games
hm7ezi1,ChaliElle,11/26/2021,1,184.0,The size of servers are the reason for separation. EUW is 2nd biggest singular server after KR (China have MUCH more players but they are spread out across 29 servers) and isnt really well known for stability. Merging it with EUNE would further increase the population by 50-60%. At that point you would have population equal to about 7 CN servers. It would be just asking for server issues.

hm8u1x9,SoDamnToxic,11/26/2021,1,182.0,Basically easy to play is not the same as easy to climb.  People confuse the two because they are dumb.  You can do well on support easily but to climb is not always up to you.

hm84c6j,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,92.0,I duod on and off but it didnt really change how I played and when I duod it was never with an ad. I mainly played pyke/rakan helped jungle and would punish laners.
hm85cx7,curiouscuriousmtl,11/26/2021,1,159.0,I just dont really have confidence that the code for the actual champions is written in a way that isnt buggy. I kind of always imagined they might leave actual engineers to write and maintain the code for champions to make it scaleable.
hm7v8vr,uncertainrandompal,11/26/2021,1,124.0,you are trying to justify someone who didn’t said anything have history of irresponsible decisions in life and just known as douchebag if you ever seen his streams.   well no wonder why so many people are so bad in league with such mental gymnastics.
hm7tyil,JevonP,11/26/2021,1,144.0,It is possible to use your brain and consider why you lost over hes just mechanically better than me this isnt a fucking fighting game most outplays have very very little do with actual mechanical skill
hm748ua,Lothric43,11/26/2021,1,23.0,With only having singles? Yeah I think you are an inferior artist if your whole album is filler carried by a couple of hit singles any album like that is lesser yes. Super cold take.
hm8tfsu,LeFiery,11/26/2021,1,19.0,Thank you for the spaghetti code lore. I hope mordekaiser breaks something eventually.
hm7iio7,scapefiend,11/26/2021,1,,  Whatever it was Upset presence wouldnt help the existing situation. Its selfish to have him sacrifice his future just for emotional support. I would be hard itd require some emotional maturity and selfishness. But that would be the right thing to do.
hm7o4g4,Bonsparks,11/26/2021,1,3.0,Oh no 10lp lost at Gold. Its the whole reason youre not in Worlds. Your life is ruined.
hm7g278,Over-Cranberry-1808,11/26/2021,1,36.0,Hey glad you answered!  To be fair you are right I did rewatch the scene (after commenting) and I gotta say it doesn’t bother me that much although I do not like the art style and the music choice I should leave that to personal taste and ofc respect it. (Still think the fireflies rap introduction was not needed)  Not sure how you feel about the music choice in the series in general tho do you only disagree with me about the bridge scene? For example you think jinx shot with sting’s music worked? Or that scene where imagine dragons materialize?  It feels to me that the overall aesthetics of the series does not match highly produced modern pop like they should have went with some industrial sounds punk something gritty and loud? I also work with video and animation although not on this kind of high end production far from it (motion graphics mostly)😔   Thanks for the reply!
hm8pm0b,Roadrollerdesu,11/26/2021,1,52.0,Lethal Tempo rise in popularity top due to conq being shit benefit him a lot since he can W you and make your LT useless. Nerf to all the bruisers benefit him since now the only thing that can keep him in check is Camille and even she needs help to duel nasus post 6. Also people that say that nasus is useless lategame are half right and half wrong sure he cant reach anyone on teamfights but if his team is decent the pressure he makes by just running at the adc with ghost and requiring at least 3 people to kill him fast is really valuable (if his team can utilize it).

hm704si,gafour,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,I dont understand why people still talk about the reason he left. What i want to know is why has adams frustration that seems to be building up all split from the way I see it was not adressed by the whole fnc management. Dont they have a team therapist ? The whole team has blown up and it seems it was happening even before. All the team seemed disfynctionnal by the end of it. I dont know how a team like fncs doesnt know how to deal with the veteran/rookie balance.
hm7o9yc,adek13sz,11/26/2021,1,,And they have deal with Cisco
hm8ol9e,tanezuki,11/26/2021,1,24.0,Technically not a Juggernaut but a Vanguard.   Unless they changed his class ranking since they mini reworked him ? Would make sense considering how he lost his two supportive abilities.
hm89wq3,Excalidorito,11/26/2021,1,166.0,Can we have a single thread actually dedicated to bug reports without someone jumping in the balancing bandwagon?  This is getting old.
hm73kyu,Stargurl4,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,An emergency in the family doesnt mean you dont have time to play a game you love. It could be anything someone could be terminal someone could have died had to have emergency surgery mental health crisis. Everything I listed are things that might require a person to just be present. Be actively engaging with their loved ones who **need them** it really doesnt matter wtf theyre doing to kill time. It doesnt invalidate Upset needed to physically be with his loved ones for a reason. Hes a human who deserves compassion.   I had to have emergency surgery last summer and I sure shit played TFT on my laptop in the hospital in the 3 days of boring ass recovery I was confined there. My husband played with me.

hm76rc3,HowTooPlay,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,You dont need to know that though and that is where the issue lies. Notice how even when Upset was going to tell Hyil what the issue actually was and Hyil stated he didnt need that information and told Upset he didnt have to elaborate Thats what a proper person does clearly Adam seems to believe he was entitled to more information than needed.
hm6z4so,Seneido,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,i mean is there any doubt that his decision tainted the career for multiple players? i would never say he did it on purpose to fuck them over but do you think a team that goes to semis and has a successfull year would implode like this?
hm7g9tv,Fishpuncommenter,11/26/2021,1,28.0,What? Stop making assumptions off of a text post. This is a reasonable request. Auto filling in jungle when you’re unfamiliar isn’t a pleasant experience especially when you’re against a jungle main especially against a jungle main OTP nidalee. His post is clear enough that his expectations of an adc main jungler aren’t high and that it’s the matchmaking’s issues.  Though I don’t know how the balance team fits into this lmao
hm73qc9,ThyPrasiolite,11/26/2021,1,188.0,Lord Iziaon normally doesnt comment under posts like this his presence wasnt expected
hm7cx0j,Dark-Dragon,11/26/2021,1,3.0,ADCs are decent now crit is the way to go for most of them. Drakes provide small buffs depending on their element and if your team gets 4 you get a much stronger buff also based on the element. The map also changes after two dragons have been slain the version of the map you get depends on which dragon type spawns as the 3rd dragon it will always be a different dragon than the first two and all dragon spawns from 3 on will have the same type until a single team gets 4. You can hover over the dragon icons in the scoreboard to find out what they do. There are now mythic items theyre supposed to be even more powerful than other fully evolved items. You can only get one mythic item although in a super late game situation where money isnt an issue you can switch mythic items. Apart from being extra strong they all have their own mythic passive which is another bonus you get for each other item you complete so at best you get this bonus 5 times if you want to walk around without boots. There are now objective bounties theyre still very new so expect balance changes to come (probably). Their idea is that the team who is behind can take a marked objective which could be a turret or a neutral objective and if they manage to do so theyre rewarded with bonus team gold.
hm7f7lv,SoundWavingSleeper,11/26/2021,1,144.0,Everytime someone mentions jensen he has to talk about how he watched his proview and he doesnt get it and is unimpressed. Doesnt paint jensen in a good light at all.
hm7vnlu,EH0_0,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,I just dont like the argument if its 3 vs 1 so something must be wrong with Upset. Is every time a larger group of people pounding on one person means they are right? I really believe it is an organizational issue. If you do not trust your team with details on your family issue the org need to make sure to convey the right words to the team while you need to leave and deal with family issues.  I had situations in my life when I could not even call my work to let them know what is happening because it was a big emergency and people unfortunately were left in the dark for hours.

hm7d88l,Jonoabbo,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,I genuinely dont get what you want. Adam is a good player I think he had a good split but when the choice is Adam or Wunder/Alphari of course people are going to want the latter.

hm844ki,Dhrnt,11/26/2021,1,39.0,Or he develops a different version Silco said shimmer production is already halfway shut down. To me that suggests he had a replacement product coming via whatever the main ingredient of the Insanity Potion will be.
hm78gtf,Falsus,11/26/2021,1,141.0,Funny fact I get 20 more ping from the EU North & East server from the *Nordics* than I do from the EU West server even though EUNE is the advertised server for me.
hm6zwco,mistood,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,I want to give you some context on Upsets mentality.     Upset meets a camgirl/onlyfans girls who lives in South America online dates her for 2 months and decides to marry her. This is her 3rd marriage and she even has nudes available online. You can tell from her social media that she has many red flags.     Upset makes the judgement to commit to this used-up cam thot marrying her after only 2 months of dating. You think he is someone who makes smart and sensible  decisions? Hes obviously a huge simp that makes terrible life decisions. I hate how he keeps saying that the reason is due to family suffering as if his mom/dad is dying but its really he has some issues with his manipulative psychotic wife.      The fact that he chose to leave 12 hours before the first game suddenly makes me believe that the camgirl wife gave some sort of ultimatum. I do believe there is some truth in Adams statement of her feeling lonely. From her bio you can tell after they married she moved to Germany away from her home in South America. She is probably not adjusting well with no friends and family except Upset. The ultimatum was probably something like  I want to go back home to South America if you dont come back then I will leave. If his wife was truly sick it doesnt make sense that he would sudenly leave 12 hours before the game. The timing doesnt make sense. He knew he had to choose his wife or league and he chose league. The real reason would give him so much criticism that I believe he chose to put it under the guise of muh privacy. If he had a real reason people would understand support and respect his decision to leave.
hm7jw0h,THE_MUNDO_TRAIN,11/26/2021,1,150.0,Xmithie might look tough on camera but everyone praises him for being such a lovable guy and a strong mental booster. He was literally the Perkz before... Perkz.
hm7b1kb,butt_collector,11/26/2021,1,115.0,>I know he cares about his rank because when I watch him play hes almost always raging at teammates or op champs or whatever   Heres your answer. He cant improve because he doesnt see that hes the reason hes not winning more.  edit: Additionally I bet its some combination of the following:  -Doesnt ward   -Doesnt ping   -Dies too much   -Doesnt consider where unaccounted-for enemy champions might be when venturing beyond safety   -Doesnt manage to keep focus over the duration of a 30+ minute game (an underrated skill)   -Doesnt know how to press an advantage when he gets one   -Constantly changing champions maybe roles too. Severe deficit of champion mastery because its easier to learn a new champ than to learn to look at minion waves differently   -Severe deficit in one or more of the following areas that he is unwilling to address: mechanics of movement wave management CS fundamentals of trading mid-game decision making teamfight positioning. I know Im bad at wave management but some people in platinum are too so that cant be it.  1000-1500 ranked games in a season is *a lot.* This person has invested a ton of their life in this game likely to the detriment of other areas. He probably has in fact accumulated a considerable amount of game knowledge both explicit (declarative) knowledge and implicit (procedural) knowledge. Some of that knowledge is almost certainly *wrong.* He probably has years of terrible habits built up.
hm7a3qj,Salvage570,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,Lotta people on reddit lack the reading comprehension to get this apparently lmao. You think if he was clear with how the situation was impacting him the others would understand though. I wonder if its just the case of Adam and Bwipo being young and emotionally inexperienced
hm8kv2e,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,140.0,kayn takes an entire team to play against since he has such good terrain scaling (q and e both give him insane mobility). he can also go bruiser assassin and tank. Only real way to play against him is to not let him get form and take objectives early something soloq cannot allow.

hm8l2il,VecnaBlade,11/26/2021,1,140.0,Id like to see you go at it again on AD as a fresh account. Id just like to see how many games it would take you since all of these accounts have high mmr to start with. Climbing from pisslow on a fresh account to masters is much different than one that has had masters/high diamond mmr multiple seasons. Not that you wouldnt hit masters anyway but still would be interesting to see.

hm728l5,Pokemon_Only,11/26/2021,1,36.0,Is that the right mentality for a player with such potential though? Instead of always wanting to play with that one player seeing him gain a passion to join another top team and go for the worlds trophy again would be so cool. Damwon are right there I just want to see it already.

hm7nw4g,Pedobear2000,11/26/2021,1,,i mean... stuff always leaks. And someone from FNCs management might be more willing to share a rough outline of the situation with someone like Rich since he can be relatively certain that Rich wont run around blabbing about it atleast not to anyone who would go public with that info.  People always seem to be amazed how long-term industry personalities like Thorin Jacob Wolf or RL still get so much behind the scenes info but it is in part due to being viewed as someone who can be trusted with sensitive information.
hm7tvkx,IAmDaleicious,11/26/2021,1,105.0,Regular season ROX Tigers Peanut was seriously one of if not the best jungler I’ve ever seen. Now when the playoffs came along he got out jungled by both Blank and Score in both those finals. He didn’t perform to the same standards at all.  In terms of raw peak junglers he’s easily in the convo with Canyon Tarzan Dandy and Kakao. Difference being that Canyon and Dandy carried their teams to world championships.

hm7029y,CoogiMonster,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,This.  I’ve said it before but you can give a little bit without giving up a lot.  His wife is getting the scapegoat treatment with “she couldn’t handle being alone” and this is all because Upset didn’t get in front of what the emergency is.  It sucks but hopefully it’s a learning moment for people involved that if you don’t control the narrative and defend yourself and those you love it’s possible that others will jump to conclusions.  The damage is done and it’s best to just not respond to these things further.
hm7m8qn,Skylam,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Thats how adam interprets it what upset has said is alphari came to him and he just guided him to the right people. Dont take one sides word for it especially an emotional 19 year old.

Im talking about Juggernauts specifically.  Mind you 16/17 of the divers which are the less tankier bruisers can utilize Thornmail at its fulf potential.  In comparison 9/14 of the juggernauts can.  I am taking every potential CC for this so even Shyvanas R or Trundles pillar is counted for this aswell as lets say Rengar empowered Bolas.  Its especially surprising it works this way when Fimbulwinter has a specific clause that indicates that melee champions can activate the passive with slows aswell not just immobilizing controls.  NB : I see this FBI flair so much on this Reddit it feels like I know you xD

hm7giwm,FrostyPoot,11/26/2021,1,1301.0,Real life? These players frontload their entire livelihood into their careers theyre intertwined...  Most of these players only have 1 chance at worlds dont diminish its importance by claiming its just a job and theyre just coworkers because theyre not.   &#x200B  The entire point that most people are making is that Adams POV is mostly defendable. His speculation was very dumb but the rest of his point makes a lot of sense. If you fuck over your teammates you dont have to tell them why but you need to make it clear to ALL of them how important it is that you have to leave. Ditching without a word to them yourself then kicking them off the team shows 0 respect.   &#x200B  And to all the people claiming that Adam posting this proves that he wasnt to be trusted feels silly. Does anyone think Adam would have posted anything like this if Upset had sat down and told him how serious it was? I absolutely dont. Seeing someone react negatively after you wrong them (in Adams POV) doesnt prove they werent to be trusted...
hm8tqa1,w00ms,11/26/2021,1,10.0,They said that the next 2 champs are from PnZ but are not in Arcane that’s why they were pushed back because they felt releasing unrelated champs during the premiere would be weird.

hm6xxdf,RoyalCaller,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Looking for replacements happens all the time in league and other esports and other sports. And all upset did supposedly was talk to alphari about the team after alphari reached out to him. Management is the ones who talk to agents and structure contracts and salaries and trade clauses and all that. The trade talks should have nothing to do with it

hm8ck0f,Jakocolo32,11/26/2021,1,7.0,“New system is limiting build paths”   Mate idk how long you’ve been playing this game but having an efficient constant build path has been the same since whenever stat sites came out in like season 4.

Guaranteed hes throwing games in those states but hyperfocusing on the games where his bot lane is 2/20  Also its bronze. Chances are a 20/2 bot lane is going to find a way to throw that lead and if you play smart you can cash in when they inevitably do.  Im nothing special G2 with 60 games but Bronze players will literally hand you gold if you play with a BASIC gameplan.

hm7peul,GunnyTheKid,11/26/2021,1,5.0,It is called roaming it can be the determining factor in if your teams wins (if done properly) or loses (if done improperly). They shouldnt be doing it during important interactions like fighting over cannon minions but say you shove the wave and force both enemy bot laners to back it is good for the support to roam at that point so the ADC is the sole recipient of turret plate gold and the sup can act as a secondary jungler to gank. If you see your support is in mid lane at a bad time for whatever reason dont go in just fall back under turret and ping them for assistance

hm8pjkf,Psyr1x,11/26/2021,1,5.0,Hey always great to see someone interested in Lore.        [League Universe](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/) is the official site has all the stories bios comics and cinematics.        Theres an option to explore region by region thus reading all the champs and stories associated with each. Thus giving u a cohesive storyline. Theres also an option to read champion by champion.        An Explore option is also there for you to see the stories by release date.        You can also hop on the [Lore of Runeterra Discord](https://discord.gg/EbFjyvy) server bunch of people who are invested in lore who are always happy to welcome new people and help them along the way. There are intense discussions as well with theories abound. It is also somewhere you can choose to be notified when new lore drops. (We have a bot monitoring it.)        We also get the writers and members of the Lore division of riot so we sometimes get the inside scoop haha. Regularly communicate with Lead Narrative as well. Pretty big community and is honestly the best discord server Ive had the pleasure of joining. Ask for Aether or Taco (or anyone u see typing really) if you need help navigating.        In terms of where to start... honestly start with whatever interests you a champ a region. etc. Its best to go Region by region to get the whole story in context. But pop by the discord to get a read as you go type of vibe.

hm7fi4u,mrmorzan,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,well someone fucked up communication and it was either upset management or both.

Adam is being childish doesnt mean upset and management are off the hook.
hm72fec,misteryon22,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Bean did well in th games he was in their poor individual performances cant be blamed on upset when it was just a skill and mental fortitude diff.

hm7ci8k,Newfypuppie,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,I dont think upset has to disclose to adam but at the very least upset needs to fucking take responsibility and talk to adam about it in a frank matter. This twitter beef is childish and they need to fucking resolve it like humans. Both sides deserve resolution on the issue.
hm7lvzh,iamcherry,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,People comparing their day jobs to pro players is fucking astounding. Upset leaving literally devalued Adam’s entire career and he will definitively be worth less as a player because of his teams world’s performance.   Whether you feel Adam is deserved an explanation is on you but Upset probably lost Adam somewhere between 100k and millions of dollars over the lifespan of his career.  On top of that people don’t really seem to realize these players are being paid in part to have less privacy than the average person.
hm7cgkd,Dassler94,11/26/2021,1,115.0,Vaas : Did I ever tell you what the definition of insanity is? Insanity is doing the exact... same fucking thing... over and over again expecting... shit to change...  Your friend probably dosnt realize how bad he is and how many things he has to improve so he keeps trying the same thing over and over again.  &#x200B  You can see that happening at many different levels that why people get stuck in silver/gold/plat and even diamond. There is a personal cealing that not everyone is prepared to surpass.

hm8h5r4,ThyPrasiolite,11/26/2021,1,6.0,Fun and really deep game short enough games to be played a lot long enough so that every game feels like a different experience and over everything else Riot really doesnt fear giving crazy shit every time.  Remember the homeless fast hobo meta? Remember the Rumble/Morgana jg meta? The impact of Viego in the game? That time everybody used goredrinker? The second time that happened? Stridebreaker being crazy being changed and being crazy but on another set of champions?
hm7i07m,Hazakurain,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,There is no hate there? He is just laughing at Bwipo locking Kaisa and Upset supposedly leaving his wife when the whole persona of Kameto is being a loser nerd.   Thats not spreading the hate.

hm7bp88,lKyou,11/26/2021,1,3971.0,Pls family emergency is what I used to say in highschool to dodge a test.  He didnt miss a day at school he bailed out on the freaking worlds possibly the most important part of all their careers. So yeah respect for the work accomplished to get to this moment calls for something just a bit less hazy than a generic family emergency(keeping in mind that he for sure doesnt need to share details if they are not close) But in the end we dont actually know what he shared with them.  Still if what Adam says is true then yes I understand his anger and yes you are right exposing this kind of internal matter on a twittlonger is uncalled for unprofessional and downright immature.
hm7tmd6,LakersLAQ,11/26/2021,1,161.0,So you argue baseless conjecture and then assume that every owner likes having their players contract jailed? lol. If anything TL is losing out on money by still having to pay Jensen his salary.

hm7wpl7,mazrrim,11/26/2021,1,,people hear what they want to Dopa has called jungle the easiest role to climb on and has also called mid with mechanically easy champions easy to climb on.  The entire perception of support as high level gameplay is honestly held back by silver/gold people duoq boosting bad players to various low ranks. I know 1 person who got boosted to gold playing yuumi with a diamond ad so this means I know the master tier support main is worse than my sick silver 3 zed play

hm7dld2,InvitemetoSkeet,11/26/2021,1,64.0,>HoB ADCs arent meta because they either got nerfed or switched to abusing lethal tempo which can be very very blatantly seen with shit like Draven and Ashe going up while using lethal tempo which they previously completely ignored  Still not seeing any Lethal Tempo oppression in worlds. You know the ideal world for HOB when LT wasnt broken. When HOB drastically outperformed.  >HoB quite literally always outperformed pissqueror on him in terms of winrate because conqueror is an awful terrible rune  Complete lie dude go look for youself \^\_\^. HOB was prob better but definitely not after prowlers nerfs.  Draven Literally had a higher pickrate and winrate last patch anyway.  Please stop lying its telling you have to resort to that but its also just embarrassing.  >AP twitch is a shit tier pick thats played once for every 100 AD twitch games. I get that the fungal growths are making you unable to see it but enormous majority of those HoB games are AD twitch with it being deflated further down by the awful AP build  Queue UP NA in Diamond mmr please and pick that bullshit please I want the dub.   [https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=moving%20object%202](https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=moving%20object%202)  But its also a lie lol go down as far as you want most AD twitch games dont go HOB.

It will be a very interesting LCK split and I hope we have some bangers even though I have this gruesome feeling that T1 is just gonna roll over everyone again.

hm83bvp,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,92.0, Thank you. I think the #1 thing is mentality. Even in Challenger or any rank Ive realized that only focusing on what youre doing and how you effect your team is what really matters. In game I think the 3 most important are game knowledge -> maximizing gold income -> mechanics. Champ wise have versatile playstyles and a small champ pool. All the things youve listed is important and should still be worked on.
hm7a1y9,SamsungBaker,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,Adam in the french tl said that Upset literally hard forced for Alphari to replace him   And i agree Nisqy had poor performance at Worlds but he literally hard carried FNC during playoffs.   And can you even blame them for their poor performance at Worlds when they learned that Upset wont be playing ? Literally everyone except Bean mental boomed at Worlds because of Upset leaving.

hm749wm,Zepth01,11/26/2021,1,41.0,Not really. Many of the pros play on tablets strictly which is standard for mobile games. Playing on your phone until masters is fine unless you want to go pro but I assume you want to play casually.  Btw I recommend if you are going to play on your phone do the tutorial which explains many controls features you can use for QoL and also try spending some time trying different settings for controls until you feel its comfortable.

hm723eo,--------V--------,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,I mean maybe? I don’t know what I wouldn’t tell the public. My ex wife had a terrible miscarriage 7 months in I told my employer and everyone else. My friends and family knew of my ugly divorce I definitely wouldn’t be keeping stuff like that from my teammates no.   I think Adam sounded like an entitled bitch which at the end of the day sucks but I’m siding with him and upset comes off looking awful especially dancing around it months later still. Everyone has had plenty of time to recover from whatever “tragedy” he claims happened.
hm7zuhd,cygodx,11/26/2021,1,88.0,I swear this sub is the same as /r/nba where people talk about players they watched a highlight of once.  Same for when nuguri got omega deathcamped and still carrying late-game and people saying he was washed in that series...

hm71fce,Delphoxe,11/26/2021,1,4.0,There is a grace period that allows every player to load the game. I believe 4/5 minutes but once that time is up the game begins and then whoever is still loading will just enter the game late.
hm74kro,RemoteAnalysis3809,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,To clarify that he didnt just suddenly left his teammates and that there were meeting beforehand where he discussed he had to for a family emergency.   Too many people online were acting like fnatic doesnt know shit and just randomly sided with Upset through the whole thing.

hm7cjys,lppur3ps3,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,I mean he literally said he shared some details with me but I dont need to know everything. So that means he was shared details.
hm79y1v,lppur3ps3,11/26/2021,1,4455.0,Yes it would but hes made clear multiple times its not directly about him its about a family member/something similar. Its literally not his to share and hes stated that. Sure it will make them feel better but it will also result in people harassing said people a lot (Happens a lot online twitch bots and even people just being terrible people). I dont give a shit about making my coworkers feel a little better if they cant trust the people Ive confided in that its a serious matter then thats even more justification to not tell them.   &#x200B  Im not saying to not be upset by it like bwipo clearly went through a lot hearing the news but I also dont see bwipo publically calling the decision into question.  I also dont see Bwipo saying it was for other reasons speculatively.   I also see people who literally hate fnatic and know more than us (Rich) defending fnatic. And I see people like Thorin also defending fnatic.  Everything points towards it being justifiable by Upset and what he did being for the most part correct. Yet somehow everyone is getting riled up about this and defending Adam for god knows what reason.   Be upset hes gone. Dont be a cunt.
hm8sdkv,thenoblitt,11/26/2021,1,128.0,Probably not 6 mil sword art or whatever the fuck it cost for perkz but wouldnt be surprised if it was the most expensive roster this year.

hm7ismk,Brief-Assistant-2772,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,I am just baffled how poor Upset’s communication skill even was. I just can’t comprehend how the meeting before the world went to lead to his teammates being so “upset” with him.

hm7ls2x,camcrazy00,11/26/2021,1,13.0,Heres what youre missing wave management has nothing to do with the laner being there all the time the best time for setting up waves is when there NOT there. The last thing most laners want is there minions pushing while there not there.   &#x200B  If the wave is frozen then when they get back they get to be there and push an even bigger wave under the enemy tower if you push it however by the time they get back the wave is just gonna be in a stalemate it doesnt hinder them perse but it takes away from the protentional push under the tower.

hm8iozm,Euphoricas,11/26/2021,1,174.0,It’s always the people blaming others that play the worst on the team and start throwing. Yes sometimes it really is your team mates but 90% of the time when I die/lose I’ll be like to my duo “shoot I should’ve done this and not done this this and this” and that’s what helps you to improve. Realizing when you yourself could have done better and how you could have done better. My friends have the same mindset (mostly) so it’s never really toxic and we’re always getting better.

hm7mqq2,SocialistScissors,11/26/2021,1,13.0,Because the lane doesnt just reset back to nuetral. Every action you take on the lane impacts where the next lane will be and where the one after that will be and so on. Even if nobody is there touching the wave for any reason other than last hitting can ruin a lane equilibrium.

hm8gai6,rudebrooke,11/26/2021,1,20.0,Hot take did you think of it yourself?
hm8f5rq,SlicerX321,11/26/2021,1,20.0,The majority just drool over every years big import signing.   Look at the top teams who have the most fans. They are all stacked with imports.
hm78z77,Agreeable_Junket_271,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,since your argument seems to be predicated on this false assumption yes family emergency can mean something minor. and obviously some fnc members seem to believe that to be the case in this instance.   I hate bringing up rumors but you dont seem to be understanding. Ill give a purely hypothetical example generated from these rumors: Assume Upsets wife got lonely and was on the verge of breaking up with him. Well he values his relationship more than the game so he goes to his wife to save their marriage. To him this is justified and urgent. But a third party observer may instead see a rash young adult year old making poor life decisions chasing a much older 2-time divorcee whom he married within 2 months.  As we can see differing worldviews changes what you view as constituting a family emergency.  HOW CAN THIS ALL BE RESOLVED? By explaining your dire situation in terms of something that is UNIVERSALLY UNDERSTOOD to be a justified reason for leaving. In my example in the previous comment a medical emergency is a universally understood solid reason.  As this example illustrates the qualifier family emergency is not and there exist examples of situations falling under this umbrella where two different parties disagree on what constitutes a justifiable cause for leaving.
hm8bwk1,blackrifleenthusiast,11/26/2021,1,16.0,Logical opinion and reasoning wrong sub. Everyone here hates surrendering lost games and like to hostage games. It’s “toxic” to give up on when a game is lost.

Unfortunate part is that its not mentioned anywhere I know.

Which means people can have power to grief by taking 4 teammate down with them and everyone loses mmr as if nothing bad happened when the intentional feeder should take the LP hit more than anyone else.

hm7fn14,Artcxy,11/26/2021,1,100.0,I dont think this is a good assumption. Whether something is a realistic personality archetype and whether or not the personality is attractive isnt necessarily the same thing. Sometimes its enough for the character to be a mesh of different fetishes though most of the time it turns out disastrous. Mels mom is an extremely rare case of this working and I love her. Her character just works in this case and the fact she isnt an archetype doesnt break her so calling her for what she is isnt degrading.
hm7anmr,Suspicious-Bus6351,11/26/2021,1,84.0,People dont understand what flame horizon as a term really means. When people were using that term originally it was to talk about how Flame from CG Entus Blaze would literally get a 100 CS difference in lane against people. I dont really understand why people use this term still since 100 CS differences in lane pretty much never happen anymore.

For example dire medical emergency would be sufficient
hm7dty5,Reddit12btw,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,So you dont understand how real life works and that if one of the things mentioned above happened to her she would be in a hospital at the time?  I mean you have fnc flair i assume youre room temp iq.

hm7lnn6,Odd_Play_5769,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Appreciate this response. You make a ton of points I agree with. On a few there is slight disagreeance between us but not opposition. I definitely have a romantic (here meaning unrealistic but in a idealized and pretty way) view and idea about teammates. And youre right that even in my professional life experience has taught me something different than the conception j had in my mind. That said I always did try to be sincere and honest with all teammates and coworkers regardless as to our standing personally or professionall. I suppose its easy to judge based on what I think should of been done especially in this instance when we have so little information.  I definitely think everyone could have handled it better but in my mind  the onus is on Upset to make this right at least with his teammates. And that even jf what Adam did was fucked Upset could have handled it way better. Appreciate you adding context to this point though: these players and frankly-at least as it seems to me- those in upper management in the organization are children. Lets be honest gamers arent the most socially well-adjusted people in the first place. It almost felt like no one at FNC took them all by the hand when Upset first brought up him leaving to the team and said here js how we handle this professionally especially for our teams public image. Most big offices have a person in HR and PR whos entire job revolved around this.   I also should say that some redditors insult another for writing a dissertation but I actually love reading someone complete thoughts like this for me the more details and clarity i have the better especially when debating that which is not neccesarily physical. Some things are not so simple sometimes you have to open up the idea and exhaust it from end to end with someone else so their is no ambiguity. I think we basically dis this. Take care friend

hm81o1s,SterbenVII,11/26/2021,1,53.0,Smeb wasn’t undisputedly the best top for 2 years though. He was only the definitive best throughout the entirety of season 6 and half of season 7.   Summer 2015 - Ssumday wins split MVP and performed just as well as Smeb did.   Worlds 2015 - MaRin outperformed everyone.   Summer 2017 - Khan storms onto the scene and destroys the LCK.   Worlds 2017 (didn’t attend) - Cuvee peaks.  Spring 2018 - Kiin debuts as the best top laner in the LCK all the while TheShy smacked everyone in the LPL.  Smeb is obviously in contention for GOAT top laner but there are so many different variables to consider which makes GOAT top laner subjective due to the closeness of the best top laners. TheShy was the most dominant Smeb was the perfect top laner Khan has the most accolades and Impact has the longetivity.   Hell Impact could’ve snagged GOAT top laner status had he stayed in Korea IMO. He’s still a very good player despite the champion pool issues (which were a product of bad SoloQ so NA super server could help him). He’s played professionally since season 2 and has outlasted Smeb and Khan despite starting earlier than they did.

When it comes to being pressured by players I havent felt like oh man this guy is too good since maybe like s6 when I played vs bjergsen. Obviously Ive lost lane a lot since then to many different players but I would know when the mistake was made and would accept the lane is loss at that moment.

hm7683w,Wizzdom,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Agree with this take. Family emergency is the most generic excuse for messing something there is. Tell that to the public but perhaps you owe teammates a little more since you are impacting their life significantly. On the other hand his teammates should have known he wouldnt miss worlds if it wasnt a true emergency. This is a matter of poor communication all around.

hm7udxz,EH0_0,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Noone is saying thay people and management do not care about other people in the team as well. Obviosuly everyone is still affected. But if some emergency happens and you need to deal with it on such a short notice you cant do anything about it but to deal with it. Do you want to be in Upsets situation and affecting your team like that while also dealing with a very important family emergency? Or do you want to be his team member in that situation? It just sad all around

hm78oio,phieldworker,11/26/2021,1,4.0,Because league is just a video game at the end of a day. Unless you are pro a content creator coach etc league should just be a video game to you. It’s ok to want to do well climb ranks win and what not. But it shouldn’t take over your mind. If you wanna still play then here are some things to stop doing. Stop spamming hours of games daily. Play like a set of 3 and do something else not leave related. Stop micro managing your allies and stop expecting them to always know what the right thing to do is. The more you try to control people the more frustrating the game will be. Play different modes than just rank in the end LP is just a number.

hm6ydnm,bocababuniors,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Firstly thats not an example of irony. Secondly there is a massive difference between criticizing someone on Reddit and harassing them on Twitter. Thirdly saying that its not like he chose for his family to suffer something clearly devastating is a total straw man.
hm72hq7,Lahwtiste,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Sometimes I wonder if people read twitlonger or announcement.  He said that over the course of 2 weeks (during bootcamp) there were 2 meetings with the team (which we can expect to be the staff and player on site)  and that during both of those he explained he was dealing with severe family issues and it impacted him. Its only at the last minute that the situation went worse and at that moment he felt he had no other choice but to go back home. Before that point it was just a possibility.  We dont know exactly how it happened but its safe to assume that it actually did so he didnt leave the team in the dark.
hm8doat,Jiffyyy,11/26/2021,1,150.0,its no ones place to demand answers if he has already stated he wishes to keep his private life private.

hm78tn3,Neeroodle,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Because it’s unfair to their teammates? You don’t exist by yourself in a vacuum when you play a professional sport. Also find me an example of a teammate leaving in a high profile case where there is controversy like this over the reason why they left being unknown.
hm75ytp,pseudolemons,11/26/2021,1,108.0,I think this behaviour is also related to League being a changing game. New champions runes and items make some of our (older players) acquired knowledge completely invalid but to us that feels like the game is to blame it is actively going against us and if we cant accept the games current reality it really hinders our improvement.  Ive actually felt this type of way recently because Ive been playing a lot with friends which led me to play some off role lanes like mid which I used to main back in season 3. The game has changed and my understanding of some of my favorite champions for that lane have also greatly changed. Suddenly I am not such a big bully with Leblanc and I can get pushed in easily. Vision is better across the board and so is survivability so my knowledge of whats lethal and how easily I can roam is also greatly outdated making me sometimes insanely frustrated with the game because my expectations were not met and my mental isnt as fluid to accept those shifts in perspective.
hm6zoo4,Odd_Play_5769,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Come on you dont think he should have been watching his teammates? Sounds like he hated his whole team besides Hylli tbh
hm8223v,Mazsi1201,11/26/2021,1,7.0,What does this supposed to mean? Realistically 600 games is more than enough for someone to be placed into the elo they belong to. Any climb you experience above a couple hundred games can be attributed to just getting better over time
hm8gqwe,bad_at_riven,11/26/2021,1,7.0,Its not abnormal for supports to roam but there are specific times when they should try to avoid roaming unless the lane is really doomed (like if a big wave is crashing to ur tower they should avoid roaming incase of dive n u loose all gold/exp). Try to look at your map before you go in so you have an idea if you have back up or not. You can never control what the 4 other teammates do so the only option is to adapt yourself.
hm6zlt0,Enkenz,11/26/2021,1,73.0,People dont actually watch lpl just judge players by post match thread.     They see bad kda=inting players and dont see more of it.

hm6xt9k,bluesound3,11/26/2021,1,119.0,Almost every NA player gets slaughtered internationally thats a really bad reason. Theres like a handful of NA players that dont get clapped at worlds or MSI. Also Xmithies laners very often fucked him over by just hard losing lane or getting outroamed.

hm8fk4o,redraz0r,11/26/2021,1,183.0,Throwing money away for a buyout when your team is already bleeding money every year simply doesnt make sense. At the end of the day the teams are businesses. It sucks that hes stuck in contract hell but it makes sense why hes teamless. Its really easy to say LCS doesnt care about winning but the top teams are throwing millions at players and not getting an ROI. You can only do that for so long

hm7gmj3,Fgame,11/26/2021,1,1301.0,I trust them both. I trust that Upset told Yamato what was going on. I trust that due to the sensitive nature of what was going on Adam Bwipo and Nisqy werent told WHAT the issue was. Now if they were completely in the dark thats on Yamato IMO. But in no world does Upset have to reveal all that information and in retrospect it was a fantastic idea not to since I HIGHLY doubt it would have been good enough of a reason for them.

hm8opmb,WintersEnvoy,11/26/2021,1,128.0,I forget which year but back with DL being in the roster and TL winning every other split TL was like top 3 worst spending compared to results roster in LCS according to Travis (comparing the wage of a teams players to actual wins)
hm6yfhi,Lceus,11/26/2021,1,43.0,> But Council voted on giving undercity to him so he made that deal even without giving up Jinx.   Part of what they voted on was for Silco to give over Jinx. That was part of Jayces terms.  Now whether they could come to an agreement that did not involve handing over Jinx thats debatable.
hm7eva6,Glandiun_,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,They put struggle in quotations. Dropping their ice cream cone is likely the biggest struggle theyve experienced
hm6y62p,elikaweli,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Already said it somewhere else but: Upset didnt ruin everyone. He has no reason why he should say sorry for making such a tough decision. In the end it is not his fault that a family emergency happens. Could happen to everyone.
hm7e6ah,PokeD2,11/26/2021,1,128.0,He literally didnt say this

hm7os4s,nash_latkje1,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Im not defending Adams take. Its Adams nisqy and Bwipos take. On the other hand I empathize with Adam because Ive played sports all my life and I would never question a teammate leaving in the conditions upset left. My problem is that upset then wanted to change the entire topside of the team without being upfront with them after pulling what he pulled at worlds he should have at least been honest about that.   And if you ask my opinion to me this simply seems mostly an org fuck up Im not even blaming the players
hm8buy7,lostn,11/26/2021,1,180.0,if fudge ends up sucking yeah i can totally see C9 signing him. Thats probably what jensen is banking on by not switching teams. Someone will int. They always do.

hm6y96t,Imperadise,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Its as simple as he owes them nothing when it comes to his private life its that simple. Their outrage is justified because he cost them potential better showing at worlds so of course they wanna know what happens. But its also upsets right to protect his private life and the privacy of his family. What his family is going through may very well not even be his story to tell. So yes fanatic members are entitled to be hurt but u as a fan are entitled to nothing so u should be leave upset and his privacy alone
hm7gl5n,--------V--------,11/26/2021,1,74.0,Fucking answer then? What could possibly have happened he won’t tell? Got cheated on? Ok almost everyone has been through that. Wife miscarriages? Ok well I’ve been through that also and would tell people. A death? Ok well the news reports on that also that’s life.   I can’t think of anything so devastating that you can’t even say the smallest of details to your teammates.   Yes I truly question his desire because if it were legit he could be vague and still let people know especially his teammates what happened.
hm8kqq1,FatPigsExtreme,11/26/2021,1,5.0,is it just me or does spica’s voice at the end sound like LS?
hm7umnk,RedditChad420,11/26/2021,1,1.0,Lol rito spaghetti yet again when will they fiux theyre game
hm7vib1,RaiseYourDongersOP,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,I mean no joke its pretty disgusting. So many people on Reddit focusing on whether Upset should have told his teammates or not but the most fucked up thing that happened was Adam making this public and saying shit like maybe his gf was lonely? or something like that.
hm8kl6j,tanezuki,11/26/2021,1,17.0,But marskmen CAN use AP items ?  They have the full value and the full passives of the items they take.  I really like AP Ezreal and its such a fun OTK burst build in URF and all the items works on his AP scaling abilities aka W E and R.  Youre mistaking items being class locked and just items not being worth due to AP/AD scalings.  Remember when Hydra was classlocked to melee users only ? They changed it.  While they didnt change Runaan for some reason (probably because itd has some very weird/broken implications) it shows that theres been cases where they decided to unlock classes restrictions. There is no set rule.  And if an Ezreal is allowed to use Ravenous Hydra as an ADC which is not at all a role close to being a bruiser why wouldnt the closest role to tanks shouldnt be allowed to use tank items ?  A juggernaut like Nasus can use literaly every tank item without their passive being locked except for Thornmail. By your logic he shouldnt use Spirit Visage as effective as tank and the passive increase of heal should be idk halved ? I could go on for every tank item like that as I said the vast majority of these items isnt having their passive locked for a good portions of the Juggernauts.  Edit : I just remembered another thing relevant here.   The newest tank item that we got Fimbulwinter has this specific close : Immobilizing or **slowing if you are Melee** an enemy champion consumes ...   They specificaly adressed the same issue for this Tank item so that Juggernauts witout hard CC can use it. Its literaly the exact same case except they thought about the issue and solved it for the item.
hm7jxqv,bluemitsou,11/26/2021,1,205.0,i play on both servers regularly and euw is worse what are you on about
hm7c3oa,AkosThe,11/26/2021,1,3.0,Honestly most veteran players hate on it but download facecheck or the u.gg app. Sure it will have a negative effect at the beginning cause you have preset runes and items but you can learn why thats the current meta while playing and shopping and getting used to the new items is way easier if you have a crotch. Just dont lean on it for too long.    Now adcs are pretty much the same. If you get fed you are the strongest thing in the world like twitch one hitting the enemy team. If you arent fed... too bad you are pretty much useless.  Are tanks meta? I dont think so. You have enough items to counter them. Im not into that type of league enough to tell you whats The Meta but in my experience bruisers are pretty great like olaf trynda gwen yone etc.
hm7i14r,FauxMoGuy,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,nah this is also kinda dumb “if he had to leave for an emergency he shouldn’t have played games with her”. it’s just an irrelevant point people are using to downplay the situation that fanatics management has already said was very understandable
hm7pih6,-LostInCloud-,11/26/2021,1,,>as it stands  to me personally  this looks like upset knew that those players wont be on fnc next split  so he didnt wanted them to have info that they could use to shittalk him when they are thrown of the team  even more so if he had a hand in replacing them  Even if thats the case that would be a perfectly reasonable decision to make on Upsets part. The chance of getting the stuff leaked is just ... too big.
hm77sbj,Old-Position6876,11/26/2021,1,85.0,hey remember how funny it was when literal fascists weaponized a bunch of stupid teenagers on the internet to uncritically spout their propaganda under the incredibly flimsy guise of fucking journalism ethics  hilarious
hm6zo2m,Exspyr,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,The thing I dont get is that as far as Im aware he never talks from the perspective of how gutted he was personally to miss what hed worked so hard for. Same goes to his team mates just doesnt seem to be any passion for words like its just yeah sorry calling in sick today kinda shit. Might be a massive misread by me but there doesnt seem to be much personal drive or understanding of the drive of his team mates. Like its the biggest fucking thing and this seems so reserved. Idk.
hm8ap29,Hazel-Ice,11/26/2021,1,150.0,to be fair ghost is a fantastic player
hm7d5b0,zaplayer20,11/26/2021,1,,Perkz when he left G2 said what was the reason Mikyx when he had wrist issues said what the reasons where many players even if they lie say some reasons to justify their absence. Upset claimed family issues which can mean many things or nothing at all. Anyway at least now some players know learned about Upset and Adam and Bwipo and Nisqy conflicts that resulted in Fnatic having a trash worlds participation. I also do feel Upset made issues harder for fnatic fans to understand by suggesting the change of almost the entire line up for him to be great. Had a similar team in 2020 and managed to poop himself in the end. I must mention i dont have twitter nor reply to him or his family i post here where i know he wont read nor he would care about my opinion. So dont hate me for having an opinion.
hm73rwr,sumZy,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,When is he going to apologise to the rest of the team for not explaining himself properly

hm7jowx,idobrowsemuch,11/26/2021,1,540.0,Its not that crazy and i wouldnt want to see it on morde but maybe on another champion?   Mordes Q (rather than a big bonk) used to be that his mace would turn into a flail and hed stick it into the ground. he could then recast Q and the skill would change based on the position of the mace head relative to morde. Like if you were standing to the side he would do a massive sweep standing in front would make him do a massive slam like current Q etc.
hm81hun,EnvironmentalBook,11/26/2021,1,11.0,Ive won so many games where a bunch of babies said its over. Its so annoying watching that guy spam surrender anytime something bad happens to him. Seems the only feeling people like from this game is completely smoking the enemy they dont want real challenge or competition. If they lose lane or even have a minor setback they are ready to quit. It doesnt help all coaches and guides teach selfishness and most people want the game completely balanced around having zero teamplay.  Just because you are doing poor doesnt mean the game is over all the time.
hm84573,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,92.0,ADs dont sack early enough and dont farm enough later. Most ADs will just die to a jungle gank to get a couple of minions. Later in the game they wont maximize their farm. AD is all about income since you spike HARD but at 3 items and most ADs cant even make it to that stage to carry.
hm77cj0,Melodias07,11/26/2021,1,74.0,Thats only what they do tbh even back in GRF days Chovy wasnt the star on that team.

hm7j60p,PresentMiddle8974,11/26/2021,1,92.0,No its just not justifiable he wouldnt share atleast vague details with his teamates who he fucked over after they had worked so hard for a chance of a life time. And then behind the back trash talking/replacement of the top lane after he single handedly ruined their worlds. Doesnt sit very well with me at all tbh.
hm7r2tx,DifficultHat5971,11/26/2021,1,12336.0,The moment Jayce wanted to kill jinx was the moment everything goes to hell. He didnt know that she was silcos daughter. I would totaly understand if silco would have started an all out war against piltover.   As for jinx man i just feel bad for her.

hm82198,ThrowingAllTheBacks,11/26/2021,1,6.0,I think T1 will beat DWG!
hm85nul,WitheringAurora,11/26/2021,1,291.0,I play on both EUW and EUNE and can for certain say that EUNE does NOT speak as much english as EUW.  Yes the Nordic countries speak English. But they make up maybe less than 12% of the EUNE playerbase.
hm7cp54,Jonoabbo,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,Normally there isnt controversy because the people involved in professional sports are adults and not children so when people choose to keep it private their teammates respect that and dont post twitlongers about how their gf was the coach of the team or how despite Fnatic management agreeing the reason was good enough for him to leave he apparently left for no reason.
hm81wnt,Whatvre,11/26/2021,1,2.0,pve? you dont need anyone in your party to play any gamemodes. If you mean having people on your team like random people just about every player who plays in bot mode are also bots because they are botting to sell accounts. Also if you just want to 1v5 the bots just make a custom game and add 5 enemies or however many enemies you want. Anyways you just dont need anyone to play
hm8mw2s,AssetJason,11/26/2021,1,12.0,Zoom also mentioned that Yagao is the only player stay in JDG. Will Kanavi go to TES with Zoom?
hm729ao,Ok_Dot9858,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Should be sufficient that Fnatic management let him go. They are in charge and it they deem the issue big enough then it’s a sign of professionalism to trust their judgement.   In the end as they said they don‘t care about what happened just if it’s valid reason. There they should have been capable of getting their answer. But they didn’t and blamed their lack of maturity and professionalism on someone else
hm87gih,fschiltz,11/26/2021,1,15.0,What about Nauti ult? I feel its inconsistent and counterintuitive what happens if you or your ennemy died before it reaches the ennemey.

hm7polj,LolWhatIAmDoing,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Bruh somehoe having 19 yo is not longer a child.   It amaze me how people seems to forget that at the age of 18 kids still partying till 7am with school at 8am giving 0 fucks. And miraculously 1 year later they are the most professionals dude out there.   Adam ate too much shit from upset and blew up pretty normal I would say. Your first year and worlds run get fucked by one dude 12h prior the tournament and you get the impression that that same dude is trying to change you saying you are not up to my standard (ofc we dont know this for sure yet it was Adam povs anyway).   And you tell me that you could do something better? Honestly as big as this blew up. All Adam did was speculate his gf felt lonely and honestly thats nothing too harsh in my book.   I would personally fuck upset myself but then I am no pro here.aaa
hm8dpsv,LeagueReddit00,11/26/2021,1,180.0,Where did I imply even slightly at that? I responded to a guy saying it was as serious as getting prison.
hm7xzt0,Jokinzazpi,11/26/2021,1,,I was talking about responsability not about what they can or cant do.  And even if no one is betting against the US everyone ends up suffering the consequences.  Its no coincidance that 2021 has been one of the years with the highest inflation rate in a long time.
hm7a6eb,Latarnia40,11/26/2021,1,519.0,I remember when riot buffed galio in season 7. After they reworked him people played him as a tank so they buffed his ap scalings. He became the most broken champion in the game. His Q got a scaling % healt damage that scaled ridicolously. His orther spells got of hand too. After buing some ap your Q could oneshot enemies just by one tick without even being fed. It some how even got to the live servers! After a day they hotfixed him and it did not change a thing. Funniest s*it ever. Here is the Dumbs video on it: https://youtu.be/6PKKFfaPipU

hm722k5,aithosrds,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,No you’re completely not understanding at all.  I could not possibly care less about “juicy details” or Upsets personal life.  My point is that the way it was handled caused more strife and drama than if he had given a vague statement as to the nature of the situation *WITHOUT* any specifics.  Something like “a family member is gravely ill and I need to be there” would have been more than enough.  He wouldn’t have had to say who or what or how serious or anything else.  We can assume that was the situation anyway but saying a “personal family issue” without any context created more strife and drama.  I personally don’t care but it’s undeniable that the situation was handled poorly and created hate and drama.  That’s negative for the team and I guarantee it was a factor in Bwipo leaving the team.  Oh and I’m in a position of leadership at my job and I’m *very* successful at it because I communicate openly.
hm8gm3c,Amsement,11/26/2021,1,183.0,He never called Jensen a bad player to begin with. LSs opinion regarding Jensen this offseason was literally that he doesnt believe that teams not picking him up is an indication that they dont care about winning because youre paying an incredibly large sum of money for a player when you can get a player of the same caliber/potential for a lot less.

hm6y7ro,BigAxolotl,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Either someone’s lying or there’s a huge disconnect in communication spurred on by fnatic management. Most likely the latter tbh
hm723xp,ElectroStaticz,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Imagined it being too difficult to say there was a medical emergency or unfortunately someone close passed on/was in an accident??? Literally the only reasons to justify his departure that I can off the top of my mind think of.  Dude legit just continues to say the exact same thing over and over and over again and hiding behind privacy  90% + people will move on with a simple but no details given explanation until he does fans will continue to bash him and his wife because so far the only details anyone has given is wife is lonely and until he refutes it with something legitimate this will continue to be contentious.     The fact that he helped remove his teammates using their performance as a reason after abandoning the team while not giving an explanation is what is truly stirring the nest.
hm71yqn,inavigateindankmenes,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Upset said on his first tl that he was transparent with hyli and Yamato.

hm7c2xx,rudebrooke,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,Youre wrong again. His coach and the management of the teamkbew exactly what it was and they deemed it to be a sufficient reason to leave. This has been stated multiple times and its also been shown in that the coach and management chose to retain him despite him leaving.   Even if this wasnt the case your point of reasoning is illogical anyway.  Youre saying he could have said X instead of Y but shouldnt the same issue of subjective experience present its self in both cases? It sounds to me like youre arguing with yourself at this point.
hm7gs0n,sscyth1,11/26/2021,1,1301.0,you dont the right for privacy around your teamaates that will waste a year of there work
hm7eguy,PepelaTeaTime,11/26/2021,1,70.0,We are literally in agreement on the basis that its fictional. Personally I am not offended due to not being culturally connected with any of the characters but just because you and I dont give a shit doesnt mean it invalidates others perceptions and opinions.   > I am chinese and I dont give a shit about whether wukong is not chinese enough because I have better things to do.  Okay? Some Chinese dont give a shit about their historical conflict with western colonialization some dont care about the Japanese imperialism nor the constant microaggressions the Chinese diaspora face overseas. Doesnt mean you should invalidate peoples opinions on a variety of topics although they may not hold the same weight. Different people have different priorities and principles.  > Yeah and I know that. And anyone with half a brain knows that she is not representative of what korean culture really is because its a fictional character in a game.  Her garments are very Korean with a butterfly 노리개 and traditional shoes called 당혜. She was also created to celebrate and accommodate the opening of the Korean servers.  Ahri is fictional and an Ionian first but the inspiration and intent of her character heavily skews that she was meant to represent Korean culture or at least their traditional garments since culture can be an amalgamation of a variety of aspects.  > Well let see. If a imaginary character triggers someones cultural sensitivity and they feel the need to spend time to whine about it on the internet then yes they should uninstall and do something else.  How about you improve your reading comprehension before you attempt to characterize someone you dont even know? I clearly stated that I am aware that she is fictional and that this was just an observation of appropriation that can trigger a lot of Koreans.   If you think I am whining about cultural sensitivity you definitely remind me of some conservative neckbeard who whines more than the SJWs he/she whines about.

hm7g30b,whydoyoureadnames,11/26/2021,1,,So blame management for no disclosing it better not upsets fault pretty simple. Also since multiple people during this keep referencing his wife it’s safe to assume they got told it was most likely something to do with his wife so they got details obviously. Done arguing with children.
hm8l23r,DankMasterJake,11/26/2021,1,205.0,Thats fair I guess. IMO I just think the gap between Bjerg/Fudge and Core/(Winsome/Isles) outweighs the potential ceilings of Summit and Berserker.
hm738hq,Tittymotorboat,11/26/2021,1,42.0,Youre gonna get downvoted because calling out past history of any gender that isnt male is a No No on Reddit.  But I have been saying it for ages. Either Upset or his Wife got caught cheating/close to cheating. Upset freaked the fuck out and left worlds. I really think its that simple. If thats the case then I totally understand why he never told his teammates because I  guarantee they wouldnt think its a good enough reason (and imo it isnt). Theyre both young adults in their 20s this is the most likely scenario now that death in Upsets or his wifes family is all but ruled out.  But hey we might never know

hm8hdwa,Sejjy,11/26/2021,1,169.0,So Im Diamond in ranked and have never played normals till a few days ago so my mmr there is like silver and bronze level. One thing i noticed from players there is just the emotional ability to deal with problems. Many are incapable of seeing what they did wrong let alone have the mechanical and situational awareness to achieve the correct decision.   Assuming this person is somewhat mature (kinda doubting since the raging) then the only thing he can do from there is rewatch his games. In the heat of the moment you dont know what could have been done better and just tunnel vision on what you think is right. Hiring a league coach is honestly pretty cheap compared to how much time he spends on it and Im sure even just a game or two would help his fundamentals a lot.   He needs someone to objectively tell him what he is doing wrong and probably to shut up in game. You can easily carry yourself out of low gold on a good champ (solo) without saying a word. The fact he is putting money into it is probably the one thing that will make him take it seriously so it be worth it. If not then hes a lost cause who just wants something to vent.
hm86tjl,AlHorfordHighlights,11/26/2021,1,92.0,this is pure cope lol support is the easiest role and it isnt close  its definitely hard to play enchanters at high elo but champions like leona and blitz are horribly broken at any elo theyre ridiculously simple and punish mistakes hard
hm8no31,saltyfruitz,11/26/2021,1,5.0,[Map](https://map.leagueoflegends.com/en_US) of Runeterra. I used this a lot when I first started getting into the lore.  [This](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/champions/) website has all of the champs and their related stories. Just click on one of them to read their bio. Most champs also have a story to read along with them too.   [Comics](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/comic/) are really interesting and easy to read as well.

If jojos upside is greater than Jensens vs money being spent... then why not? Its a logical decision for this one. This one isnt about growing a rookie. They and many legitimately think Jojo is that good.  &#x200B  With these things being said I hope Jensen can land on a team and take them to worlds. Hes one of my favorite players.

hm7dgry,Epamynondas,11/26/2021,1,29.0,idk if this is what he means but since LPL is on every day of the week with different teams playing each day each team has a different schedule of training days/days off i would assume for long breaks like the lunar new year schedules line up more
hm7g73b,Amsement,11/26/2021,1,144.0,Doesnt mean he thinks Jensen is bad. Could mean he doesnt think Jensen is worth the price youd pay to get him which is something he has said before. What youre doing is just putting words in his mouth for no good reason.
hm7apm9,moroheus,11/26/2021,1,50.0,Now look at it. There are 100 things that could have happened. The question is why is your first idea... yoyoyo wait you havent even paid the previous session. Wtf is this youre trying to screw me over or what
hm8tog1,Rektile7,11/26/2021,1,,Oladipo passed up 2 big checks to take a minimum lmao
hm7zklx,Min2op,11/26/2021,1,55.0,Hey man im curious about your opinion on champion pools and affects it has on climbing. Do you think sitting on 3 champs is much faster way to climb? Is it Better way to learn the role? Do you think it limits learning due to lack of playstyle? ect... Also since you were just doing it for fun i assume you did not care about the pace of your cllimb. I think if you stuck to a smaller champ pool you could of avoided of lot of wasted games especially on jungle and climbed much faster. Thanks.
hm7mi7z,BDNjunior,11/26/2021,1,114.0,Ok sorry every single juggernaut and bruiser.

hm8i2s1,WintersEnvoy,11/26/2021,1,307.0,When the server schism happened riot defaulted you into correct regions but you also got 1 free swap and basically everyone in sweden swapped EUW (there were memes surrounding why mostly like not liking playing with poles/russians although I had a friend say that and no spanish because apparantly swathes of spaniards swapped to euw not sure if true)  I was one of the last guys who even went to euw (of the old guard anyway) I had friends who insta went to euw and then back to eune and back to euw within 2 years but in the end every friend I played with went to euw except some finnish guy. Default creating accs was always in EUNE after the schism  &#x200B  But if you ever started to play league after this schism those players were mostly invited by old timers to play euw. So there was never a chance for most people to main an account on EUNE unless you started playing by yourself or through someone who did since everyone who joined the game via friend would eventually go to euw since thats where 90+ % of swedens playerbase is. I did have one friend who managed to play on eune until I think the start of this year before he finally swapped probably since his OG was one of those rare groups where people played by themselves rather than get invited by old timers
hm79ua5,Rizeren,11/26/2021,1,84.0,Now imagine them taking the grand slam. That would be TV series worth of story so many years of not making it to finally take it all as the first team in the world lol.
hm7lkeu,calife89,11/26/2021,1,13.0,Think he meant to say some people manage their waves so taking the farm disrupts their strategy. Some people just get mad though. As support if I don’t have item gold I’ll just stay in lane and last hit to gain exp or freeze lane for adc when they get back supports are usually always behind in levels so it helps) but some adcs/laners get pissed just for last hitting. Same vibes when I push a wave that a laner abandoned “you’re a support why are you pushing a wave”.. cause it’s crashing into our tower while you roam for kills and there’s this thing called laaate game

hm7hzzv,TechnalityPulse,11/26/2021,1,120.0,Ya theres a reason before smurf queue was implemented people would just smurf to get to challenger quick long-standing accounts MMRs are pretty hard-locked by the system. Soft resets only help to alleviate the problem to a small degree. There should be options for a hard reset on an accounts MMR or something along those lines. Even if it means you have to restart from Silver or not allowed to play ranked for a month/year w/e.  My main account thankfully has Diamond MMR and maintains it but it struggles to get higher MMR without me winning like 10-15 games in a row. And 1 loss resets my work. But conversely its so hard for me to lose Diamond MMR that even if I troll like 10 games in a row Im still not losing more than 15 LP a game.  If I took a smurf and brought it to Diamond with 65-70% winrate itd have masters MMR and Id basically skip D4/3.

What Nisqy crying and Adam feeling not matter after u screw them? There is not an ounce of guilt from it. I too feel offend if i was treat like Shit.   The tweet only happen because of this. If the tweet hallen because Upset leaving Adam will post it during world considering redditor saying how immature he is.     Tldr: Upset recent action had cause and effect. The effect is this.

hm7jnu0,itsmariokartwii,11/26/2021,1,2.0,Mid roam and jungle ganks are part of the game by design. You might as well quit the game as a whole if you want to get rid of them because they only become more frequent as you gain elo.
hm7cncc,nizzy2k11,11/26/2021,1,157.0,the problem is if you have servers in russia you have to follow russian laws. they would have to follow EU laws regardless this way they just handle the transaction fees and dont have to care about russian laws much.
hm7q8a4,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,17.0,in terms of soloq in just climbing to masters (hardest to easiest)   support > top > ad > mid  > jg   this order would be different in challenger
hm7a13j,mistood,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,So the reason he doesnt want to share with his teammates is because its fucking embarassing to show simp you are. Keep in mind she has hundreds of nudes available online was a sexcamgirl/onlyfans and by some South Americans claiming she dabbled in sex work.

hm78vc3,Falsus,11/26/2021,1,141.0,While amusing insults like that happens most of them are just poor broken English of the usual insults although less slurs in chat than you would expect since insulting people with racism isnt that common in EU. Names can get pretty racist tho.  And of course insulting someone in their own language expecting not to get caught.

hm81l5h,VaporaDark,11/26/2021,1,277.0,> My guess is that its tricky to merge the elo/MMR from 1 server to another. D1 EUW is not equatable to D1 EUNE.  In theory this would only be a temporary issue where the players who result in being too high MMR for their own skill would quickly lose and drop down to where they belong.  In practice people would scapegoat the merge for years to come for causing the terrible game quality theyre already experiencing claiming things have been worse ever since it happened because the inflated players keep winning against each other and keeping each other in high Elo.  So realistically its just impossible to do it without being a PR disaster unless they want to do a full MMR reset which theyve shown to be extremely against and may possibly still lead to players scapegoating it for high Elo game quality anyway (all the bad players just spammed games to get to high Elo before the real Challengers started grinding and now its impossible to remove them because theyre playing against themselves!).  Weve literally already seen high Elo players cry out against game quality using these same excuses after the inflated LP gains in season 9 despite that bug affecting only LP not MMR and therefore not matchmaking. Anything that happens which *does* affect matchmaking would absolutely be scapegoated to hell and back and be held as a monument to Riots incompetence.

hm7di87,Btigeriz,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,IDK why its framed this way. Those 3 players were either replaced or left the team so its not Upset vs them. Clearly Fnatic management thought Upsets reasoning was good enough or they wouldnt be rebuilding around their botlane.
hm7u29h,uncertainrandompal,11/26/2021,1,124.0,where you seen my assumptions?   it’s only facts:  -	upset said he needed immediate action to do  - played all day arams -	upset said he told yamato before leaving - yamato said he didn’t knew anything.   i better trust actions based on facts rather than damage control posts which doesn’t clarify anything and exactly what expected.
hm7c2zo,amroth6464,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,Of course they do.  But what is not their right is to write a public statement implying he and his wife are lying downplayin what happened to them.  Especially when theyre highly probably living a serious drama.
hm70w9d,mistood,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,This is some underrated information.     And Upset is the only one simp and foolish enough to marry her after 2 months. If hes simp enough to marry this used-up thot after 2 months hes definitley able to give up his worlds run to please his psychotic camwife.     If he had an actual real reason he would share it to his teammates and of course they will understand. They might not be happy but they will understand. But the fact that he keeps hiding under the guise of muh privacy makes me believe that he doesnt have an actual good reason. Just that he needs to satisfy his camgirl wife the same way he proposed to her 2 months after dating.

Some brain dead jungler pushing your lane halfway to the enemy tower is worse than them just running it down and giving over a kill because no you either cant farm or have to risk dying multiple times to fix it.
hm7lpri,Unnomable,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,I agree with you being shown this response from Adam and Bwipo probably means Upset was right not to trust them its just difficult to say with certainty.   Either way the choice entirely belongs to Upset whether people believe he is justified or not. I dont think that knowing the reason would have changed anything really and attacking Upset / his family is a shitty thing to do anyways.

Notice the people defending that a lux thats 3 levels down just one shot a fed adc its because of them that the state of the game is the way it is riot wants everyone to carry so now you can go a mage support and just try to one shot people because supports do get way too much gold for doing nothing its dumb.

I mean for real just make a new account and have a friend or pay someone to duo with you until you hit diamond or whatever your goal is…Then you find yourself in diamond even if you got carried there… game gives the same mmr regardless of your skill it’s originally based on a chess rating system that is optimized for 1 on 1 not 5 on 5. And unless the new secret mmr system is drastically different than ELO I don’t see how it can be consistently fair to a 5v5 game leaderboard.

Similar systems but they have to be balanced differently because they impact the game differently.  Btw the time limit on bounties as far as Ive seen is only triggers when the gold gap closes so the two things you mention are actually 1 way they work differently.

hm77lrs,Ok_Dot9858,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Utter nonsense you’re basing your judgement on assumptions. There certainly are personal matters that you don’t want to share outside of your family/closest friends. Claiming Upset would use such an incident as pretence is simply blatant speculation also slandering. Which fuels the hate we can currently see from the very civilized french community.  If they needed justification they could have gotten it from Fnatics management. Them allowing Upsets departure should be enough indication for the validity of his leaving. At least if you are mature and professional about it

[https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/main-stats](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/main-stats)  What I am hearing is that shaco and Katarina should have 55% winrates. I respectfully disagree.  Anyway swain is not as hard as you make him out to be. I played swain during the middle of this season and he is by far the easiest botlaner I have played. He may have significantly less carry potential than most marksmen but he really isnt that hard to win with. The main skill in playing swain is landing your E and that isnt even required on botlane swain because your support can just CC them for you. Because of his ease of access he is probably balanced around a 52% winrate but he should never have been able to hit 55% for half a season without being hotfixed.
hm8d6iw,Kripox,11/26/2021,1,29.0,Ye and I cant remember Vi ever being all that dominant lvl 4 so this isnt new. Its possible she has gotten slightly weaker at that point still this season I wouldnt really know but I really felt the need to point out that overall Vi is really good.

hm8auy1,tanezuki,11/26/2021,1,9.0,Juggernauts have around the same defensive stats as tanks and have way higher damage for the price of having less mobility and crow controls. They definetely can build tank items.   Also Yasuo Yone and Irelia builds shieldbow while not being marksmen.   I remember Viego also either builds it or Kraken Slayer if not Divine Sunderer.   I could go on for days about items not being tagged for a class but having champions from that said class being perfectly able to use them.   So a tank item being usable by the closest class there is to tank isnt too fantasist I hope.

hm79vv3,Tittymotorboat,11/26/2021,1,44.0,>You immediately jumped to the conclusion  Did you read what I said? Its my fucking speculation holy shit I even said we probably wont ever know what happened and providing deaths in the family is ruled out. Thats the most logical thing. I even said it could be Upset who cheated.  Whats wrong bud did you get cheated on or some shit? Did me bringing up that scenario trigger the ever living fuck out of you?  >So that is 80€ for the first session and 50€ for every additional.  I dont use obsolete currencies sorry.

hm7puj3,Uhloy,11/26/2021,1,17.0,Which role do you think needs more love? In terms of balance?  Which role frustrated you the most?  In which role did you feel like people were being the most toxic towards you?  Edit: Just realized you live in the same province as me! cool :) and congrats!
hm7eil3,Jiffyyy,11/26/2021,1,56.0,its not scummy to keep personal life information to yourself. what would they do with that information? would it make their worlds any better? people simply want to know so they can judge for themselves.  does your own work force you to disclose all your personal doings just so they know
hm7vte6,Halseyqueen,11/26/2021,1,64.0,I would love to! ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|flushed)
hm7pibb,DangerousSeaweed0,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,for one  its not reddit that is harassing him  but twitter mostly.  secondly  its not that reddit cant take a no. we dont need to be the ones to know whatever the fck is happening with him or his wife or if its even the case that its something or not in the first place.  were all arguing that upset fcked over his teammates and gave them no reason. u cant have 2 people come out and say they had no ideea about the situation untill 12h before the tournament start  and imply upset handled this rightfully.  if anything  if fnc knew that this was goin for 2 weeks  it makes even less sense for them to not give bean a lot more scrim time then 2 10 minute games.  so its obvious that somebody is lying here  and as it stands ...its a 1v3.
hm7d999,hotbooster9858,11/26/2021,1,27.0,Tbh if Riot manages to make clearing less scary (it really isnt you can get used to the kiting really easily) more people will play it just like they did with support.   Ive recently started playing jungle again since tbh I really like what they did with removing the 3:15 coin flip mechanic and now with how creative you can get with pathing its pretty fun even.   Clearing is rather easy if you path well you can almost manage to be the highest level in your team every game (which is disgusting in my opinion) with the biggest hurdle in the matchup being getting your camps stolen which can put you really far behind with the first crab being nerfed that hard.  The biggest hurdle that seems hard to overcome for Riot is how hard it is to transfer skills from any other role to jungle. You simply cant learn clearing and pathing by playing anything else while if you play any lane you HAVE to know wave management lane manipulation trading patterns and stuff like that at the same time a lot of junglers are absolutely terrible in lane because they have no idea how to lane and for sure their role wont help them with that.
hm8bkrf,lostn,11/26/2021,1,180.0,deals took too long so by the time he was told he could speak to other teams theyd already found their mid laners.  And also he will only play on a top team. He could still join CLG or FLY if he wanted to but he doesnt. If he stays where he is and streams he still gets $1m a year with no pressure to perform. This is better than going to CLG for half that being on a shit team and having your stock tank.
hm7caww,Ulyrres,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,Idk if the stuff about Upset playing soloq games with his wife days later is true but if it is then I can definitely understand the other 3 being like rage level pissed off at him. I respect his desire for privacy i also respect their right to be royally pissed
hm7ld55,riverkim09,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Fans demanding answers directly from the front office seems a lot more civil than harrassing a family member of the player.
hm7tlqs,MistahSquishy,11/26/2021,1,120.0,If you start an auto animation (even if its 0.0001 seconds into the animation even without actually damaging anyone) your invis will cancel.
hm74tam,KvotheM,11/26/2021,1,42.0,I think a big age gap sex work multiple divorces and getting married early for a Visa is not a good thing in a relationship. Whether it is a guy or girl who is youngest.
hm80inv,sluethmeister,11/26/2021,1,6.0,I saw speculation that it could be Silco but this theory is eliminated in WW’s bio where it is said that WW saw a bearded man reflecting in the eyes of a beggar who WW was getting ready to eat.  He is also from Zaun and had to be captured by Silco at some point or at the very least Silco’s chemist. We never got to see what happened to Vander’s body.
hm8hxxl,JukebocksTV,11/26/2021,1,12.0,Its the job of the support to harass the adc when they step up to CS just fyi
hm7kmvk,SolaSenpai,11/26/2021,1,13.0,because if you do dmg to minions itll make it push towards the enemy lane and they wont be able to access their cs till an enemy pushes it back essentially denying multiple waves (assuming a tower as fallen)
hm74nsa,thelightfantastique,11/26/2021,1,141.0,Which sucks I swear. Before the split I was getting latency as low as 9ms so for sure they set up closer to me but now Im in the 23ms and this the only reason why Im not challenger.
hm79v23,SirDavve,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,people react and handle situations differently which is another reason why I think comparing it to DL or perkz is unhelpful. Just because it is something that you would be comfortable sharing doesnt mean he is. Also I doubt youre as famous or subjected to as much public scrutiny as someone like Upset is so I think it will be hard for any of us to put ourselves in his shoes.
hm7vhcv,wotad,11/26/2021,1,89.0,I mean depends what the contract is who knows if you get full pay while on a bench.
hm6yjsm,widhfbez,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,His PR team better explain why was he boosting his gf while his teammates were getting ass fisted in groups.
hm7454a,1nc000,11/26/2021,1,51.0,Very good! Thanks for taking the time to make this.
hm6yd3y,ghostytemppc,11/26/2021,1,10.0,Exactly. People are bitching that its unfair but it helps to combat snowballing cause your team has a weak link. And a lot of the time the people bitching are people who lost a game cause the enemy team got the gold and it became a skill diff instead of 5 levels over 2 items up
hm7ony8,FuujinSama,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,So we agree. Hyli is a decent human being and respected someone. The others are immature and emotional and cant understand that shit happens and life sometimes just sucks and no one is to blame.
hm7koeq,namja23,11/26/2021,1,56.0,The music mixes extremely well with the scenes which causes strong emotions.  So with it being new people are excited just be happy for them dude.

hm7b3qh,SnooChickens7571,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,What a bs he should be happy he is with fanatic in the first place and not be so arrogant. He also just begun his career.
hm76h64,Lambisexual,11/26/2021,1,23.0,Whats wrong is that unlike literally every other objective in the game (Baron and Elder included) its a literal game ender by merely possessing it. Its just not fun at all nor do you rarely get rewarded for playing well against an enemy with said soul. Because they will just revive and most likely get a revenge kill. One time we killed a fed enemy Katarina first thing in a teamfight she got revived and then got a quadra kill because most of our stuff we used to catch her was on cooldown.   Baron and Elder are meant to be game enders. However they are both timed and its not always an insta win by just possessing them. You can play smartly around it and try and stall until it runs out. Chemtech soul has no cooldown and it will remain for the entire duration of the game. Theres really not much you can do against it. You just have to win every teamfight twice.
hm763fk,PowerfulRice5704,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,There is a difference between being totally transparent and airing your dirty laundry/family matters (Bwipow) and keeping a professional separation and simply informing his team that he needs to return home for his family without going into specifics.
hm8nmlt,csudoku,11/26/2021,1,10.0,Fiddlesticks is literally a demon not a robot soooo no. And Blitzcrank lore he is built by Victor but Im certain that will change but he is built to help people so Jinx building him wouldnt make that much sense. Remember Viktor and Jayce saying that they have to crank it when talking about the frequency to stabilize the hexgems. Might mean the 2 of them will build him. It was Viktor and Stanwick in original lore but we know that Stanwick lore changed as he was one of the founder of the academy and is long dead now.

hm760ld,Grandmafelloutofbed,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,Ah there it is. The real root of Upsets mindset Dont question me and just go along with it and then you are a trust worthy person. He literally just has to say like three words My moms sick or something like that give them something. Hey guys uhhh so I need leave at the most critical moment....yeah yeah I know our first match is 12 hours away......I told you family issues......what issues? you dont need to know just trust me. Like fuck you bro you aint the coach or my boss I dont have to just take that.
hm6y14z,Ozianin_,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,How come?
hm6yk1h,KnitCat99,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,I still feel that the drama could have been drastically reduced if he had commnicated better with his teammates especially Bwipo and Adam. Yes I understand that things have to stay private at times but he obviously failed to bring any kind of support to the team.
hm6zwn1,tameniee,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,He saw we all struggling to read that tweetlong and just decided to put out a summary of everything he said there
hm7g6pz,cr_y,11/26/2021,1,57.0,Genuinely curious whats the cosplay communitys opinion on people that edit their photos to complete their costume?
hm70iim,Jiffyyy,11/26/2021,1,42.0,yea im sure everyone including Upset are down about how things turned out.  >Coz the people you have worked with mean nothing to you.  They mean less to him than his family which is a pretty normal thing to have for people. some people choose work over family and some choose family over work.
hm7tbhp,Kuinshiii,11/26/2021,1,2.0,I don’t like player bounties either. I don’t know if random spawns would really work but knowing the bounty spawns has its ups and downs as well.
hm87aw6,SituationGood922,11/26/2021,1,92.0,I meant that as whether Tyler is a possible candidate for the first question. I think he currently plays all roles at like 600LP+ seems like one of the best fill players.
hm6xspl,yurionly,11/26/2021,1,43.0,But Council voted on giving undercity to him so he made that deal even without giving up Jinx.   Shooting rocket is both Silcos legacy and Jinx showing that this is her and Vi should accept that. Thats why jinx said at the end that Heres is to new us before shooting rocket.

hm8la3l,meincreft,11/26/2021,1,572.0,not a question but I have been thinking about a slasher/bloody horror skin line for future halloween. champs like gwen or darius would fit right in. the bewitching skin line is cute but it is so generic.

hm795xz,VoidChaoticGod,11/26/2021,1,51.0,Love u man as a talon main
hm89g0w,ConscienceNot,11/26/2021,1,,The thing is that your statement is trash. In 99% of case sceratios. At early levels you are going to make use out of hob way much more than out of electro and if you dont opt for full lethality then hob is better rune even at late and actually gives you damage when you need to use emp W for whichever reason. Also it has much better CD. Cong might be at longer fights but fights that last much longer than 2 or 3 seconds and sucks at other aspects. HoB isnt best from both worlds but is very close and thats the point. Best early game rune and best rune when you go full crit.
hm7ozzh,Ghost-Mechanic,11/26/2021,1,19.0,Couldnt have said it better myself
hm7lbsk,Craftingistheway,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,They didnt have to trust him. They have to trust managment and coach because they do now. if they cannot even do that yeah they can rightfully go fuck off elsewhere.
hm7snip,deeeeksha,11/26/2021,1,120.0,this is amazing thank you. hopefully these get fixed soon! I’m also praying that he gets an ASU like Caitlyn did he could really use one.
hm72p68,LAndLight2,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,He wasnt asking. They asked about his opinion and Adam and that was that
hm773db,Vantablack9,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,> was already looking to replace everyone but Hyli  Upset said Alphari asked him about Fnatic and Fnatic asked him about Alphari. Even Doublelift says thats pretty standard in sports and he doesnt understand why Adam would bring that up because things like that happen all the time in all teams.
hm79m6t,mistood,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,Upset meets a camgirl/onlyfans girls who lives in South America online dates her for 2 months and decides to marry her. This is her 3rd marriage and she even has nudes available online. You can tell from her social media that she has many red flags.  The fact that he chose to leave 12 hours before the first game suddenly makes me believe that the camgirl wife gave some sort of ultimatum. I do believe there is some truth in Adams statement of her feeling lonely. From her bio you can tell after they married she moved to Germany away from her home in South America. She is probably not adjusting well with no friends and family except Upset. The ultimatum was probably something like  I want to go back home to South America if you dont come back then I will leave. If his wife was truly sick it doesnt make sense that he would sudenly leave 12 hours before the game. The timing doesnt make sense. He knew he had to choose his wife or league and he chose league. The real reason would give him so much criticism that I believe he chose to put it under the guise of muh privacy. If he had a real reason people would understand support and respect his decision to leave.     So my theory involves that this unstable camgirl wife had some sort of mental breakdown and told her 2 month old husband who was away due to Worlds preparations to tend to her or she will leave.
hm7ut3g,VITEZADUZT,11/26/2021,1,563.0,Thank you so much.
hm8rwoh,imjunsul,11/26/2021,1,27.0,Yea Dwg needs to do something... There are rumors about TheSHy going to LCK but I have a feeling its T1 or he stays with iG. DK should go after a few rookie/young players and hope 1 of them stands out or hope Nuguri comes back mid season.
hm7whs8,LazerFruit,11/26/2021,1,,Nah it was Selfmades fault

hm7faxu,UnironicallyWatchSAO,11/26/2021,1,75.0,Yeah dw about it playing this game without a duo is boring and tilting as hell. And anyone who duos often enough knows that its not easier at all if anything its harder due to the matchmaking fucking you over but it sure does makes playing ranked more fun.
hm7caby,phieldworker,11/26/2021,1,6.0,That’s because we’ve been conditioned by a lot of content that winning is the only way to measure growth. instead look for smaller goals that you can track that will help string together wins. Things like CS per min low death average damage to objects  etc.   But in the end if you’re not having fun just don’t play anymore.
hm8posa,crazynam101,11/26/2021,1,134.0,big W congrats my guy
hm7bjpr,xCherry,11/26/2021,1,42.0,They had to rent the whole hall to accommodate the flooding of people that visited the Riot booth the prior years they also hosted the EULCS Playoffs over the course of those days there. So in 2015 the visitor count would have doubled and it would get too expensive for the limited exposure the booth would offer.  Gamescom nowadays is a chore to attend to when you look at the visitor numbers and that event area didnt get any bigger over the years.

hm7x2es,howtopayherefor,11/26/2021,1,558.0,Isnt that easier than it sounds? Based on that quote it sounds like the VFX were the only problem because the way theyre handled for projectiles is too inflexible. So once you have remake how the VFX work for every ability creating a new projectile just means you have to make it like the other projectiles.  It would be pretty future-proof but still not worth remaking the VFX for all current abilities
hm7gn4b,amroth6464,11/26/2021,1,1301.0,you seem to forget that Upset family who has nothing to do with esport are the most impacted.  And their story isnt supposed to leak to thousands of people because a 19yo kid feels bitter.
hm7y547,RavenFAILS,11/26/2021,1,134.0,These bugs are outrageous and unbearable for talon mains.  I think we should disable him for the time being just to be sure talon players dont get too negatively effected by these.
hm7bi59,Rikkimaaruu,11/26/2021,1,1127.0,Haha an yes the good old Q3 CTF Days.  The early Days of iam connected with people from around the world. Felt like first Contact with Alien Lifeform. ^^
hm7i9sv,Ulyrres,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,Fnatics management flat out said they dont know the specifics of the issue just that he stressed its severity. There are a limited number of issues that I personally feel fall into the category of worth missing Worlds and screwing your team over and I can guarantee if any of the things on that list were happening in my personal life I absolutely would not be playing League of Legends

hm741xm,Hrkeol,11/26/2021,1,42.0,He literally said he had tow meetings with the mangment in the 2 weeks before he left to tell them about the situation and what he is going through.

This whole cheating thing is a pity speculations that have no basis so eathier post some evidence or just get outta my face with that.

hm8mk10,Banglatiger,11/26/2021,1,1.0,Wild rift makes playing certain champs look so much cooler. Like Camille fells so badass in Wild Rift and vayne W active sheesh.

hm86zoq,ImTheNguyenerOne,11/26/2021,1,111.0,I mean Dennis Schroder turned down a 4 year $84 million dollar extension from the Lakers because he thought he was worth 100 million. Had an awful playoffs and signed a 1 year $5.9 mil contract with the Celtics. Granted a much larger scale money wise but theres a reason players usually sign long contracts
hm7op92,ZozoSenpai,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,You are kinda confusing cause and effect. FNC plays for bot bcs their top is so shit thanks to Adam you cant play towards it. Even if they wanted to they couldnt play for top instead of bot. If they played for top instead of bot whole summer split they wouldnt have made playoffs dont even mention worlds.

hm8mul1,EvyLuna,11/26/2021,1,165.0,Ive heard it described as the difference between Iron and D4 is the same as the gap between D4 and D1 which is the same as the gap between D1 and Grandmaster.  You can get to D4 without learning all the ins and outs of the game. People get to Plat without thinking anything through beyond the next 30 seconds. You start needing to actually learn the depth of the game somewhere in Diamond and how well you do that is a huge factor in how high youll climb assuming the player isnt held back by mechanics.

hm6yx8a,CoBe_1g,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Its a little bit different here. Once you join a team you are in a brotherhood with your teammates where all of you are working toward a collective goal. Upsets decision to leave the team was detrimental and his teammates deserve to know why countless of hours they spent just gone to shit. He doesnt need to get into details just enough so that his teammates can get closure. For some of these people doing good at Worlds might be the biggest accomplishment theyll ever achieve in their life so they deserve a damn good explanation from Upset.

That can literaly be anyhting starting from as small as hey my wife is feeling bad i must go. The fact NOTHING was explained (no ones asking about details) is the reason why 3 not 1 but 3 players on the team are completely clueless why the got fucked over.
hm7lizp,Rikkimaaruu,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Losing all my Q3 Demos was one of my biggest losses in life so many fun memories from online and LAN sessions.  And yeah russians come close second behind french guys when it comes to stuff like that.

hm7wvt5,gandalf45435,11/26/2021,1,,Okay maybe I am offbase with this but if you are actually equally comfortable on every role wouldnt this be the best move as far as climbing?  If it greatly reduces any of your teammates getting filled you lose a lot of variability in the quality of play from them.

hm6yow4,Nicolu_11,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Ok so Ill admit it *might* be a mistranslation. The part that Im refering to says:   &#x200B  > Between us there is absolutely nothing legal in Upsets departure and his departure is totally unjustified (at least until he says why he really left BECAUSE until today Upset just left to join his girlfriend because she felt bad to be alone and maybe Im wrong who knows?  And I dont know  but she felt bad to be alone sounds weird phonetically.   However I doubt that upset said exactly My wife is feeling alone I gtg thats just stupid (but who knows maybe it did happen). Adam himself says in the above paragraph that the reasons were Urgent Family Reasons and he also writes that Maybe Im wrong who knows so its a possibility that he was speculating to generate drama.  P.D: I never pictured myself discussing about proplay drama. What has this subreddit done to me????.

hm891ez,Moon_Breaker,11/26/2021,1,10.0,Big fat nope from me on this.  Just one more reason for people to blame each other.  You drafted x champ when y dragon was going to be on the map?? omg you just lost us the entire game  Before the game even starts.  No thank you Im against anything that is going to tilt people before the game even starts.  Plus Xerath(ex) 1-tricks would dodge every Cloud soul People would flame their jungle for not picking a champ that focuses dragons when its a Chem soul etc.  Just 100% unnecessary.  &#x200B  The entire game doesnt need to be mapped out before it starts.  Evolving strategy on the fly to adjust for things like what soul pops up is a big part of gameplay.  This is like arguing that we need to see the enemy teams roles/runes/summoners before the game - No we dont.  You adjust to what is there after Lobby and go for the win.

hm7lb5k,amroth6464,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,well if you read all the tweetlongers youll understand that Upset told them.  For 2 weeks before leaving he told them his family was living some serious crisis. 12hours before world something happened and he left telling everyone he have grave family issues explained to fnatic staff then left.  He then wrote a tweet explaining he has serious family issues and had to left.  The only thing he didnt say was if it was about miscarriage cancer attempt suicide or whatever shit may have happen to his family. And why would he ?  Youre just all pissed because you dont know about the morbid details of his family situation. So does Adam. But did he know it was serious ? yes.  why the fuck would he believe him more if Upset was saying his wife had a miscarriage ? He already doesnt believe him when he says its a serious matter. What difference would it make about this ? I mean outside of satisfying his own curiosity ?

I play on EUNE Ive rarely met homophobic slurs on the server unless someone is doing homoerotic roleplaying in the chat. And if you are doing that in LoL all chat then you are certainly not any more normal than they are.
hm7sspz,ShinaMashir0,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,I just find funny that now 75% of people on reddit are for some reason siding with Wunder even tho literally everyone shat on him last season (maybe even the last 2 season tbh)  Im personally a wudner fan and i always defended him but he could be either washed/decent or back to his peak again but chance are way slimer that he will be very good again

hm7x54x,NoobFade,11/26/2021,1,20.0,Active: Jax enters Evasion a defensive stance for 2 seconds causing all non turret basic attacks against him to be dodged. Jax also takes 25% reduced damage from all champion area of effect abilities. Counter Strike can be recast after 1 second.  At the end of the duration Jax Stun stuns all nearby enemies for 1 second and deals physical damage to them increased by 20% for each attack dodged up to a 100% increase.  This season Jaxs clearspeed in the jungle is lower because of the removal of machete and youll generally lose fights early game if you stick around after using E but past level 6 or so and sheen you can fight him easily. Also works pretty well into Udyr top because your E makes it hard for Udyr to kill you early and you outscale him pretty quickly.

hm8alus,shaidyn,11/26/2021,1,9.0,Pretty much yeah.  The system puts too much emphasis on your first 100 games. If I have a 60% win rate in my first 100 games in a season (or on an account) my rank will skyrocket. But after that it slows down dramatically.  If a player has a 60% win rate over 50 games at Bronze and then Silver and then Gold their rate of climbing should NOT be slowing down. If anything it should be accellerating.

hm7a6ht,jaguar317,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,I agree. You can tell that Nisqy and Bwipo are frustrated and I feel for them but they arent also sending waves of hate to Upset and his family. Adams a 19 year old rookie who just had a disaster at the pinnacle of his career. I feel bad for him too but what he facilitated with his Twitlonger is completely unacceptable.

hm72mq8,Odd_Play_5769,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,I guess it depends on what you value. Obviously this is a HUGE grey area for EVERY human most humans dont even know what they value themselves and they are THEMSELVES. So your perspective is fair. Generally speaking I try to be as transparent as possible with everyone in my life but especially my coworkers and while I rarely get that back from them I do expect it on some level. Whats interesting to me is if Upset simply said nothing the whole situation would have blown over in a couple days but speaking in this instance made it worse
hm7c8cw,Angry---train,11/26/2021,1,60.0,> Conq always outperformed soloq on Draven Draven was invisible in pro due to bans and picked to counter tristana. All onetricks think conq is better in soloq with hob outperforming in higher levels of play. Even then they dont agree as some always went conq. Soloq players went Conq such as ChadDraven Tyler1 PSZ while people that cared more for pro like JackSpektra and Arrow went for Hail of Blades. Asian Draven mains always went HOB. Draven did not get worse with it in soloq after HOB nerfs because more people stopped going that rune his wr actually increased. I know you are surprised but then you go on lolwiki and see that he was 110% bAD ratio on his Q so it actually makes sense.   HoB quite literally always outperformed pissqueror on him in terms of winrate because conqueror is an awful terrible runeespecially for ranged champions like him which take a decade to stack it and dont even get good benefits from the small amounts of stacks  >Lethality Varus was the only way to play Varus so he is obviously going to take Hail of Blades. You Seriously thought lethality Varus was going to take precision runes? Other 3 were invisible last patch they werent bullying LT users like Twitch (I know your tumor in the head thinks HOB has higher winrate but thats AP twitch) Kog and Jinx.   His lethality build had a piss shit winrate in comparison to his on hit one yet HoB remained way higher in terms of power because you dont lose your rune by trying to poke the enemy team the same way you do with lethal tempo  AP twitch is a shit tier pick thats played once for every 100 AD twitch games.  I get that the fungal growths are making you unable to see it but enormous majority of those HoB games are AD twitch with it being deflated further down by the awful AP build   >Here are your words  >Old Lethal Tempo had the problem of being hard outclassed by HoB on the big majority of its users with a few exceptions like Kog and Jinx  >This is the contested point.  >There is also this  >Only thing that you are correct about HoB users not being all that goodbecause the current meta is dominanated by ADCs abusing lethal tempo  >HOB users are not meta in the current meta because ADCs are abusing Lethal Tempo?    HoB ADCs arent meta because they either got nerfed or switched to abusing lethal tempo which can be very very blatantly seen with shit like Draven and Ashe going up while using lethal tempo which they previously completely ignored  >I refute this by saying they havent been meta for a while. I SPECIFICALLY used worlds as an example because you are a dicksuck for probuilds. Pro players loved going HOB/Inspiration.  >Like I said HOB was not meta in worlds what was being picked in worlds?   >HoB is massively overrepresented  >HoB users get nerfed  >less HoB users in pro  >actually HoB is terrible and bad

hm7srn2,snowflakepatrol99,11/26/2021,1,144.0,If he wanted to improve he wouldve. There isnt a person in the world that can unironically be stuck in bronze if they are trying to improve. You just need average IQ to not be fully blind and to have semi working arm/arms/leg/legs. Theres players with no hands who play with straws and racing pedals in diamond. You cant tell me he is seriously trying and is still in bronze.   He likes the idea of being higher rank but he is never putting in the work required to get there. Raging at teammates and op champs is most likely because he refuses to accept that he is there because of himself and denies the fact that he needs to work on his mistakes in order to climb. Bad mentality is about the worst thing you can have when you want to improve.  Another red flag is playing 1000+ games and not improving. This only happens if you autopilot and dont think about anything in the game. You are just doing. If you win you win. Just taking random engagements here and there and relying only on muscle memory to carry you. Well when you are bronze not only do you not have any muscle memory to rely on you also arent improving because you arent playing to improve you are playing to play and waste your time.  Ive tried coaching a gold friend of mine because he said he wanted to improve and hit plat but after a few games it was obvious he didnt want that and hed rather argue back pointlessly and pretend that what I pointed out wasnt a mistake that he needed to fix. The biggest things in your improvement journey are mental and not playing in auto pilot. Most players that are stuck are lacking both of those.
hm7vgxo,MapPotential9009,11/26/2021,1,243.0,Sad but true. Ivern isnt an assassin therefore hes very low on Riots priority list. More sexy skins for Ahri come before fixing niche picks like Ivern.

hm72mi0,Redryhno,11/26/2021,1,108.0,To give the argument a fair shake though theres an extra layer of minimap that the ui tells you is the actual game.   Like seriously go into a normal and see how far away you have to click to not have it register on the minimap.   Now how much of this is my flipped ui I dont know but its been a persistent issue since the map rework.

You’re severely overestimating how much more useful it is over electrocute especially when considering that you already get attack speed from your q. If any of what you said is correct then we would be seeing HoB instead of electro.

hm7h84v,Gaarando,11/26/2021,1,144.0,He has literally called him bad many times with Nemesis. He also said this Worlds performance wasnt good even though anyone else thinks differently and he believes Jensen is not a good laner because of pro view.

He was frustrated about not finding answers. He literally didnt know it was that serious and neither did Bwipo or Nisqy. It wasnt just him who was completely confused about the situation.

Not only  can you no longer snowball a good game into a win but a single lost team fight can also get the 1 already fed person on the enemy team full build in a matter of minutes catching their entire team up and then it goes from a +5000 gold difference to a -7500 gold difference.   Bounties are not fun.

In addition wards in an actual lane give less vision. I think there might be ones based on whether its in enemy jungle or river or stuff like that but I cant quite remember

hm7bvkg,pinkspott,11/26/2021,1,7.0,Thank you so much for the quick reply! Thought it might end up being this way.       Its almost intuitive at this point: the reason for ability behavior is the reason for lots of inconsistencies just the usual this is what happens except for these edge cases but theyre not gamebreaking so its not going to be standardized any time soon sort of thing. Basically it is how it is and it is what it is.    Still doesnt hurt to check with the resident *Sion-aea muscipula*. Thanks again.

hm7yxfz,GutsWay,11/26/2021,1,,Coming out swinging for no reason. You made a really disrespectful statement and it deservedly received a response with disrespect. Dont act surprised. You must not watch any other team sports. There are a handful of adult athletes who would react the exact same way as Adam did. His emotional response is completely justified. The only person without an adequate emotional understanding is Upset as he has been extremely selfish in regards to not telling his teammates why he left. The fact that Upset refused to tell his own teammates kinda proves that.
hm7fpj8,TemporaMoras,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,> insult Adam by saying hes moronic.  He is a child and he reacted like a child. idk what you would expect from a 19 year old who just learned that fnatic want to replace him because he actually doesnt realize he was probably the weakest part of the team for their run in the LEC (Not saying he is the weakest top laner just saying that the other 4 member where way above his skill leve)
hm86zu8,OrionOW,11/26/2021,1,291.0,I don’t know why but for some reason like 30% of the time when I see Spanish in team chat is when it is written by a Senna player.

hm7n6wh,EnjoyThisAfternoon,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Your logic has a big flaw are you telling me Bwipo and Nisqy would be as idiotic like Adam if Adam told the reason of Upset leaving to the world? Dont make me laugh.
hm7mt85,CuteTao,11/26/2021,1,63.0,I wouldnt be surprised if bjerg took a salary cut in order to help secure the roster tho
hm77u0m,BokoBors,11/26/2021,1,51.0,Im pretty sure no matter how bugged/strong a champ is it wouldnt matter but bugs are bugs and theyre super annoying + easily fixable its just super annoying someone trying to enjoy their champion but a bug happens and they die/dont get a kill because of it. Think of it this way:  Put yourself in his shoes how would you feel if your champion was bugged for straight up 5 years ?XD     EDIT:What does champion balance have to do with this anyway.. the guy is simply stating the champions bugs hes not complaining/stating how weak/broken Talon is

Coz the people you have worked with mean nothing to you. Bro this is not the normal way...
hm7613b,AsahiMizunoThighs,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,we literally know thats not what happened.   im so confused why reddit tends to bang on about innocent until proven guilty but then always tend to gang up on someone who gaslights a woman just because she has an onlyfans
hm78n4v,yawnbaby,11/26/2021,1,46.0,Youre really judgmental. Im just interested in Arcane and here you are trying to dissect me as a human being.  I dont know what your perspective is because you wont tell me. I thought I mentioned that in my last comment? I just want to talk about Jinx and the lore. Im not here to jerk myself off or for a feel-good high. I dont need reddit to raise my confidence in fact commenting on things is something I rarely do especially if its opinion based. This interaction with you doesnt upset me its just exhausting because I thought Id be able to see your points of view on the subject. I thought Id have a debate of sustenance one that can open my mind to different ways of looking at Jinx. Instead youve taken severe offense to my choice in vocabulary and refuse to talk of nothing but that.  I dont know what you think nor am I trying to assume. Its the very reason why I asked in my first comment to which you failed to answer. I dont feel superior its a fucking comment on Reddit. How does anyone feel superior? I dont know where you pulled out all these assumptions but youre dead wrong. Your negative outlook on my character has robbed us of talking about anything that matters.  Im simply a girl who fucking loves Arcane and I dont give a shit about trying to feel superior or whatever twisted shit reddit people get high off of. You havent offered me anything about that matter and this discussion has turned from one of promise to a tedious repetitive carrousel. It feels like Im talking to a brick wall that thinks Im an enemy out to get them.
hm7hrac,Craftingistheway,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,Which needs to drastically change. The fact we as society have not outlawed paparazzi all togehter is inexcusable and shameful.
hm7eaz8,GiannisisMVP,11/26/2021,1,1196.0,True its very likely Adam has torpedoed his own  future I certainly wouldnt want to be on a team with him.
hm8i5am,Zemahem,11/26/2021,1,7738.0,That was what I thought at first too actually but it still ended up looking like she just hugged him.  Maybe if there had been a second or two of her ineffectually trying to punch Silco before giving up and then opening up to him it would look less like she just immediately switched sides.
hm723dd,TH3RM4L33,11/26/2021,1,51.0,On some untargetabilities the blades continue their travel hit the air but on some they despawn completely. I noticed it mostly happens on untargetabilities that make the champions icon disappear from the map. I thought thats vanish.

hm77v3f,happygreenturtle,11/26/2021,1,62.0,Be very careful about what guides you follow on YT. When you see somebody with different how to play guides on like 10+ different champions you know their intention is not to teach but to profit. They pump out as much content as they can with no regard for how accurate it actually is.   Theres a few other people like that Ive come across while looking for good guide videos on youtube. Most of them are playing on smurf accounts in Silver/Gold or theyre playing a custom with friends etc. KingStix isnt a trustworthy source of info   Id recommend using leagueofgraphs to search up the most successful Evelynn players and then lolalytics to see what the highest winrate runes and items are. Use that info to draw your own conclusions and experiment with stuff.   If you find that Predator+Zhonyas still works best for you then at least youve created your own playstyle rather than following somebody elses misinfo

hm7rxtm,snowflakepatrol99,11/26/2021,1,252.0,Not gonna lie I dont want to be in the shoes of the players that have to now endure EUNE players. The game was a shitshow before they split the servers. Everyone switched to EUW with the free transfer and if your friend started later then hed obviously join the server that you are in.  Theres absolutely no reason to play in EUNE other than a little less ping. Worse players more toxicity and overall way shittier server with no end goal. You only see shitty egotistical EUW players who cant reach challenger go there so that they feel better about themselves. No one unironically goes to EUNE to climb. If they ever try to merge them then you should be able to search games based on language just like in dota. Its the most annoying thing having russians french people and turkish people all flame each other in their own languages. Separating the 2 servers was the best thing to happen to EU.
hm7i0f4,Kaztiell,11/26/2021,1,1300.0,Let me explain to you what free to do it means it means you can do it without any risk of getting legal consequenses for it.  good that we both can have a laugh at this conversation

hm72xqe,ChapVII,11/26/2021,1,65.0,Finally someone get it and dont get trap by Silco fake caring for Jinx well being. This character is a A+ manipulator he might love Jinx in his way but he for sure use her trauma and dont try to heal her hes toxic as fuck !  Notice how people never mention the fact that Powder trauma stem from her trying to protect her family against him and his minions.
hm72iw6,NotC9_JustHigh,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Its his wife now. For upsets careers sake I hope this shit doesnt repeat. But then again a lot of these young players have tons of women throwing themselves at them. Its hard to gauge who is good and who will cause trouble. Personally I like rekkles way of not even going for these serious relationships while being a pro player. Casual gf for companionship>serious gf who youll upend important events for.

hm7lces,computo2000,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Honestly his twitlonger felt more like he was sharing his thoughts with his fans nothing aggressive it was social media that turned it into a drama.

hm792g1,RemoteAnalysis3809,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Im gonna guess that his wife had a first/second trimester miscarriage that went nasty. The timeline matches and the pregnancy explains why they got married so quickly. It also explains why he cared so much since thats his wife and child who might have been in critical condition. I dont think you can play with such a state of mind.   It also explains why Upset seems to be holding the secret not just for himself but also for his wife. You dont want to go around telling people you met at work about your wifes pregnancy going nasty. Especially when you and your wife are both in a line of work where everything you do gets discussed by 16 yo dudes online.   Considering that his wife is also a somewhat public figure and even worse a sexy woman I can already imagine the kind of harassment that would take place if dude opens his mouth.
hm6yt65,RestinNeo,11/26/2021,1,85.0,Its definitely worth a try especially since they offer free month trials .
hm79peu,nepaesa,11/26/2021,1,1055.0,Except it doesnt give public attention to only tell your teammates who Id expect would keep your secret if it was as serious as Upset claims.   If anything not telling created more speculation drama and unwanted attention

hm7ij8b,Craftingistheway,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,They dont tho. It is none of their buisness.  The only one who have any right to know are his employeer to be able to judge if they can/want to work with him. He provided them information they go on with him.  THAT IS ALL they are entilted too. Their org checking with the player if that was a legit emergcy or not.  They are NOT entilted to know details to bascially go ahead and question their judgment. That is not how this works .     And ruined is a hard word for a french fucktard who got even put on the map and a midlaner that got screwed not by worlds performance but the org greeding for buyouts.  Besides getting still a sizeable salary. Yeah obv their ambition is worlds but there is a limit to everything and they got plenty out of that year still.      It is indeed not a controversial opinion because there is no opinion to be had. There are the fact they are NOT entilted to further informations and the judgment lies within the org. End of story.
hm83rf0,TH3RM4L33,11/26/2021,1,159.0,Id be okay with the delay if his passive did enough damage to compensate. But Im not gonna suggest it because were getting into balance here. I just want  Talon to feel smoother to play.

hm7grqd,Tilterino247,11/26/2021,1,144.0,Theres no source for this besides fans bootyholes and if we follow a few simple steps of logic we can find that its probably not true.   Would TL want to keep paying Jensen and not have him play? No benefit to them and great cost. So theyre probably motivated to sell appropriately. Would Jensen want to afk instead of competing? Based on his words I would think not.   Tl would rather sell him for peanuts than keep paying him and have him ride the bench. Jensen himself would rather take a pay cut than ride the bench.

hm8epjr,Odd_Play_5769,11/26/2021,1,6.0,While the initial learning curve is unbelievably steep once you learn the game you can play forever and its very very fun win or lose if you know what youre doing.  Most other sports are the opposite: extremely easy to learn and understand but you cant really play at the dame level forever since your character (your body) eventually breaks down.   There are assumptions that League players will decline even FASTER somehow than physical athletes where I think the opposite is true. If were to define mechanics as mechanical skill displayed through sharp/quick inputs (which is trackable) relative to opponents inputs (basically fancy way of saying reaction time) then  DOPA displays relatively average mechanics especially for his rank. But notice he hits rank one basically every season at some point except this season. Even then he was high 1k+ Challenger on Chinese Super Server and KR server the two servers with the reputation as being the most skilled difficult to climb in and competitive.   The jury is really still out on aging e sports since the whole industry is still in its infancy. But it seems most names I remember from Season 1 are still playing and at a very high level at that. They may not be pros but they are still challenger+ on servers which isnt a joke thats very impressive idc what server.

Like this totaly contradicts the bullshit Adam tried to spin aka loney wife wants attention narrative. It means his depature while not planned isnt the 100% unforseeable stuff that would leave the team clueless. It literally says it had to be obvious to his teammate that him leaving means whatever situation he hinted at weeks earlier escalted.

hm7kxo1,RemoteAnalysis3809,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,>Three of his teammates agree they knew absolutely nothing about the situation and the severity of it in any form  That is false. The teammates dont know what exactly happened but even Adam said in his twitlonger that he knew its a family emergency that had to do with Upsets wife. I assume same thing goes with Bwipo and Nisqy as in they all knew its a family emergency that had to do with Upsets wife (especially considering Bwipos weird twitlonger that we didnt realize is a jab at Upsets situation until now) .  That is not knew absolutely nothing about the situation and the severity of it in any form. In fact the statement here also clarified they got two different meetings about the situation before Upset left.   &#x200B  >feel that not enough information was given.  That is the main problem. The reality is what is enough info anyway?   Upset and management view enough info as I have a family emergency involving my wife that I need to deal with while clearly Adam Nisqy and Bwipo dont think thats enough.   We can see it in this very same thread. Upset supporters be like coworkers should not know your personal lifes detail. Your employer knowing is more than enough vs Upset hater be like Its a sports team and so people deserve to know because worlds is the height of everyones career and Upset not explaining his wifes situation to his teammates is disrespectful and worthy of condemnation.  It all boils down to what you want to prioritize in life and Upset already made that decision months ago when he left.
hm7vxip,LoLrovex,11/26/2021,1,17.0,2 big ones Ive seen  Supports in under masters and even masters+  NOT DO (which is a big mistake)   Tank supports can impact the map heavily by themselves since they have CC. On resets they should be looking to roam while their ADC is safe.      Enchanter supports can very easily 1v2 lanes but play behind their AD when this is not how they are played.
hm76dws,SP3EDI,11/26/2021,1,1001.0,what has upset to do with nisqy not having a team ? Nisqy wanted out and go to c9. C9 bailed fnatic wanted a new mid and no one wants nisqy. so he played his cards wrong and is  ha no team because of his own misjudgement. Why is that upsets fault ?

hm7sc3m,Twouseacc,11/26/2021,1,551.0,Yeah great concept honestly but I hate the exection.  I like how they handled sylas you have to  think about which ultimate is the best for a situation and you could also take an ultimate and save it for when the right moment comes and you can only have one per fight (for most of the game) so you had to really make it count sure sometimes there is only one good ult and you keep taking that the entire game but when you DO have a choice it feels great.  Very much unlike viego where you simply take anything and everything that comes up and yeah you can still think about who to possess first and what not it really just feels like you take whatever comes up mash all keys at once and move on to the next target personally very disappointed with how little thought there is when the concept had so much potential that we will never see.

hm79bmc,grapplingmanx9,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Honestly Ive been reading this drama and while it was entertaining at 1st now its just boring. I think Upset did them dirty leaving before worlds and not telling why. Worlds isnt a tournament that happens once a year and everyone is invited it can be once in a lifetime opportunity and a way to carve your legacy. To make yourself look good and be worth more money (and not be teamless). Upset mightve screwed over more than 1 career with this move and I think its a fair right for them to be mad at him. Furthermore I think being a professional athlete comes at a price - privacy. Its like working at call center and crying because of mean clients. Its just how it is furthermore fans can make your career (raise your stock) or just bambard you with shit on twitter. Now I dont think harrassing anyone twitter is right thing to do but such big actions are bound to have consequences. I quite honestly feel that both Adam Nisqy and Bwipo had shittiest time of their lives during worlds especially Bwipo who too had relationship issues and I can bet you that the only thought going thru his head was fuck man wish I can fuck off from this tournament and try to fix my relationship. And then Upset comes across as quite arrogant saying it was HIS dream HIS goal etc. Its everyones goal and dream its a team sport and then even when he does not attend the tournament he wants/tries to replace players because they arent upto HIS standards like I know you want Adam to shut up but I think you should shut up sometimes too. If you dont want to reveal any details just delete twitter altogether or be like: family issues wont tell because thats the key message from all of those posts not bringing any new or important information and leaving everything to everyones interpretation.

hm6ylr5,Mohikanis,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Youre forgetting Rekkles was under contract in G2 so theres like 0.05% chance he was on the market available to Fnatic lol.

hm7q6rh,GutsWay,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,Not sure if you read my comment but I said he should specify what the emergency was. A personal emergency could literally be anything. I remember one time Crumbzz (the caster) was telling a story on the analyst desk of how this girl told him to come over and he told riot he had a family emergency so he couldnt cast. A personal emergency can literally mean anything. Stop justifying his actions.

hm7s4n4,FireDevil11,11/26/2021,1,144.0,Which is why Riot enabled people to increase map size to a pretty huge part of the screen.
hm7zfvi,RiftHunter4,11/26/2021,1,3.0,It would break landing. Minions are a big factor in early game lane control. Im not gonna jump on you if I have to walk back through a fat minion wave. Running to jungle isnt always safe and neither is going around the minions in some areas. With how much damage they deal being able to walk through them might make diving champs too strong early game. Just my guess though.
hm7jyei,Elibu,11/26/2021,1,1428.0,Goddamit he didnt try to replace anyone. Why does everyone keep repeating that shit
hm7nfmm,BulletCola,11/26/2021,1,551.0,It has several ideas that were scrapped as wel:  Such as him having a scaling HP passive that increases by 1 based on doing something very simple among others.  Also he was going to have a kit overhaul akin to Sion Poppy and Urgot as well before any of these ideas were explored I believe.
hm7jxe7,Ceetrix,11/26/2021,1,,lol empathy? Youre not talking about empathy youre talking about narcissism i.e. empathy for the self.   How about some fucking empathy for his fucking teammates eh? Nisqy crying on the couch Bwipo mental boom the guys getting embarrassed in front of the entire world and now their market value has gone to shit because of it.   Anyone who thinks those guys dont deserve an explanation doesnt deserve a shred of empathy from anyone.
hm7n0eu,ice_wallow_qhum,11/26/2021,1,1.0,First sentence. So regular bounties should be removed too? I agree that it should need some sight into it but makig it random or on a tomer sounds weird.

hm7t5cv,Poluact,11/26/2021,1,252.0,Ok look at your keyboard right now. Imagine you have to roll your face over keyboard and it should result in the word pandemic. The letters all over the keyboard and you have type them on the right on the left in the middle left right again... Its the same with женщины. And you do it once and get it from first hit. Because surely this guy didnt type it again and again and he also couldnt check if he got anything meaningful because he dont understand Cyrillic by his own words. 7 letters by the chance coincidentally. Yeah of course its accidental.  Theres actually much better explanation - he just copied it somewhere. The only confusing thing is his 1st word - where would he copy that. He didnt type it - why would he have Cyrillic layout installed if he doesnt understand it anyway.  Its honestly amusing its even a discussion.
hm77vn7,lolKhamul,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,Is it that hard to understand guys that got a years worth of work sacrifice and commitment stolen from them and as the cherry on top they dont even know what or why?  Every FNC player or staffer has the right to blame Upset. If I were on FNC I would never ever want to play with Upset again. Reasons dont matter. It would just split the bases between people that think it was justified and people that dont. Its literally irrelevant what the reason was. The only thing it would give it maybe closure for the FNC players.  In the end it stays the same. Upset had a right to do what he did and he has the right to keep it private but every FNC staffer on the 2021 team has very much the right to blame him for ruining their year.   &#x200B  And if you cant see and at least understand Adam you are just lying to yourself. Because I would bet anything that you would be fucking furious if you committed a years worth of work (8-12 hours a day) towards a common goal with one or multiple partners and in the end one partner leaves you hanging destroying everything and doesnt even tell you why.

You are at work and you and your coworker have to design a presentation for your next big customer to convince them that they should take your company for the project.  You and your coworker work the entire year for that presentation. Than on the day of the presentation your coworkers doesn’t come to work and he has all the presentation slides. You don’t know anything about the reasons he is missing and you of course do a shit job at doing the presentation without the slides. No imagine that said coworker doesn’t explain anything to you after you have asked him why he ditched on you. And afterwards you find out that he even went to your boss and said „yo he isn’t up to my ambitions we should replace him“   Lmao in a working environment I would fuck this dude up it’s insane actually what kind of dick move this would be
hm7nu0n,uncertainrandompal,11/26/2021,1,1569.0,yamato said at the time of events  he didn’t know anything as well. but upset saying he knew so 4 vs 1.
hm759c5,whydoyoureadnames,11/26/2021,1,1002.0,That’s on fnatic management then not upset. Again not hard to get. They don’t deserve to know more. Simple.  These people aren’t owed details into his private life his wife had a family emergency that’s all that needs to be said. Them feeling they deserve more info is a them problem and management failing to communicate not upset.   And that doesn’t excuse Adam aiming his fans to harass upset.

He is employed by the org are you telling me you really believe that FNC had no issue with Upset leaving worlds without a proper reason???  Now I am sure you are smart enough to answer „no“ to that question which then begs the question: If Upset told FNC why he left and they had no problem with him leaving why the fuck should Adam have a problem with it?
hm7zbch,Excalidorito,11/26/2021,1,277.0,Asian players (and eastern servers) usually have far more of a FF15 culture.  I think that’s a big reason why objective bounties were introduced to stop the FF15 culture just because enemy got FB/first scuttle/3 kill advantage.

Pretty clear that the only people who knew the details chose his side and surprise surprise they just happen to not be his best friends.

hm6ynsm,Personal-Expert3395,11/26/2021,1,1003.0,How is upset valuing his privacy is wrong but Adam stating a lie in twitlonger about the reason he left which lead to both of him and his wife to get  harassed is right? Like I understand you love Adam but use common sense. Also you should see Yamato response for those like you that says that the reason is something trivial and just an excuse.

hm8nykj,FiraGhain,11/26/2021,1,191.0,I think being a millionaire probably compensates for any amount of hours required to stream in a month. I dont think hes dumb enough to go from 1.4million a year to 200k- or whatever is needed to shift himself to a mid-tier team. My guess is that hes warming the bench until Summer at the least when the big spenders need to save their season if their new mid doesnt work out.

hm9harj,CuriousPipe8558,11/27/2021,1,13.0,Glad to hear I’m down to 1 other friend who plays but he mostly plays with a new 5 man group mostly naturally I try hard but I think I’ll probably never get my goal of masters. Skill cap maybe is real cause I play pretty much as much as one who is working can yet can’t cross the finish line
hmaj5l8,HostJoyner,11/27/2021,1,87.0,He’s good player who excels at laning but his positioning is just horrendous. Poor man/Theshy. To his defense most carry players CANNOT play weak side. IMO Zoom being the best at this might be just TES needs.

If you are bothered by learning a new language then its your full right to refuse.  He is playing LOL not participating in a talkshow. And considering he is the sole reason FPX didnt go 0-6 Id say you should rather flame his mid and jungle for playing worse than wildcards from Brazil

hmakybu,Reiir,11/27/2021,1,376.0,On the contrary lol. Life fucking happens even if  league is a game for us its a job for them - many of the players gave up on their studies/regular jobs in pursuit of a career in esports. Adam is a rookie who could make a name for himself on the biggest stage in his rookie year Nisqy was working on his redemption story after going to NA and being mediocre. Its their livelihood not just a random event they get to attend however many times they want. Adam might never be able to attend again.   But yes call me a child because I think career is more important than a wife feeling lonely.

hmathvx,Glum_Radio,11/27/2021,1,112.0,You better watch EDG documentary and understand what i mean.  Communicate after the match talk about each other feeling talking to each other take care of each other i dont see anything that make me feel like they’re trying to help Nuguri with their best effort. They’re noisy but not communicate much with Nuguri? Communicate here is talk about everything until he talk to you not just say one or two word and then give up because he’s ignore you lol. “ Nuguri would also talk about the members sometimes on stream” => it’s nonsense he and they should talk WITH each other it should be direct conversation. FPX maybe has tried but not their best try. I see they try like 2 or 3 times and then just give up it’s a fault of both side but the organization should put much more effort to make it work because you’re the one losing money here blaming just make it get worse. In Viper case you can see he has extrovert personality but EDG still doesn’t ignore him and alway try to communicate with him all the time if he doesn’t want to talk they still talk to him.
hma379p,9percentmilk,11/27/2021,1,27.0,I loved the original music for Arcane which unfortunately makes the Imagine Dragons stuff so much worse by comparison. I’ll never understand why they had such talent to lean on and they decided to go with bland pop rock from a decade ago for the theme.

hmaf3x6,musashihokusai,11/27/2021,1,,Doinb is a social butterfly. His definition of “won’t talk at all” might just be him saying “he’s an introvert”.   Moving to a new country where you don’t speak the language is difficult for anyone. I’ve done it several times and it made it very hard for me deal with people (even when they were being very nice). I don’t have “social/personality problem”. This is why imports usually don’t work. The ones that succeed and integrate well are exceptional people.   Some players don’t communicate much and just follow through on shotcalls. Different players communicate differently. Sometimes you need players like that if you have strong voices on the team.

hmaj1oi,Pure_Void,11/27/2021,1,26.0,blind pick is 10x more toxic then draft since at the start its a race for roles and when ppl dont get it they complain or cheat u out of there role so the first thing i would do is play draft only and if ur just starting the game i wouldnt play ranked when u hit 30 because u dont know enough about the game id just keep playing draft till u learn alot more
hmbce5v,TheWarmog,11/27/2021,1,22.0,Iirc he wasnt in ionia he only gave the weapons to the noxians no?    Also he didnt have a debacle with heimer cause hes evil he had a debacle with heimer because he wants to discover new stuff no matter how good or bad those are hes a scientist all he wants to do is discover and learn new stuff and heimer showed multiple times how he puts limits to how far people can dig due to safety reasons.    I wouldnt label singed as evil he doesnt give a fuck he only cares about science the rest is futile.

hmaizvx,blitzeeee,11/27/2021,1,7.0,Cho’gath is literally the violator from the spawn comics. Fiddlesticks on the other hand is a demon birthed in the first scream of creation. There are stories about fiddlesticks in every region of runeterra. The shurimans talking about some kind of monster that invades the tombs with treasure hunters already in them just to kill the hunters while the only thing that can be heard is screaming coming from the tombs entrance. The noxians prefer the story of a farmer that didn’t meet his quota for his month and was fed to the crows only to come back and haunt them. His in game base skin is his demacian iteration I believe. A collection of farm equipment and weapons cobbled together to form what someone could mistake for a scarecrow for 1 split second out of the corner of your vision before he races over and tears you to pieces. The way he moves is sometimes kinda like walking but it’s usually just 1 piece of equipment being tossed out in front and then used to drag the rest of the contraption along and when he recalls the demon gets out of the cage in the centre tethers itself to the contraption then flies off with them. He also plays like no one else in league and when your up against a fiddlesticks you find yourself standing a little further back from the walls in case you get ulted on out of nowhere and that mini heart attack you have when you face check a bush and one of his effigies flashes away sells this character for me.

hmb7fiu,CarefulConsequence2,11/27/2021,1,10.0,Like others have said I think people will still treat people ranked as ranked even though its preseason. I recommend if you want to grind when the season does start to play a bit of normals or even draft since there are 2 new dragons that change the field. For one chemtech it makes you invisible for a bit when you go in the jungle. Hope whatever you decide is good!

hm9z0cr,Yusomi-,11/27/2021,1,115.0,Was about to post about this one too.   Since the Rioter requested steps to reproduce:  1. Get an element with W 2. Throw Q at enemy and hit them directly at the end of the basic Q hitbox and the beginning of the empowered Q hitbox. 3. Observe as they take no damage as they pass through an apparent gap in the hitbox.  Also QWQing fast as Qiyana only applies one instance of her passive which is also dogshit and needs fixed. This is likely because the W goes off before the first Q hits and so the newly Wd element has its passive applied and the first Qs element gets lost.  Fixing these bugs would be greatly appreciated.

hmal16c,FantasyTrash,11/27/2021,1,376.0,League is a job first. He is well within his rights to choose what personal information he shares with his colleagues. Only Yamato and Dardo truly need to know. Hyli for example didn’t even ask he just trusted Upset. That is an exemplary colleague and teammate.  Upset said he couldn’t trust Adam and look what happened Adam aired out so much dirty laundry and practically invited people to harass Upset and his wife. It’s this kind of situation Upset wanted to avoid yet it happened anyway and validated that Adam couldn’t be trusted.

hma45l7,Dastu24,11/27/2021,1,16.0,We are playing flex atm and the enemies againts us are up to masters in soloq in contrast to g3 we max faced before.   And yes you can have easy time in silver if you play champ that can carry or jngl for example.  The first time i got into gold in solo around 40 games in i swear i lost 25games in a row out of which 20 were afk ppl and i dont like you i will feed sure you can carry some of those but the difference between this and what we play now is insane. And yes difference is solo and flex but that also mean we sometimes face full 5 ppl squad and are still able to defeat them.  And as i said being stuck in silver i wouldnt thought i could do better but now playing g1 games these are the best games and experience i had in a long time. Actual enjoyable games with ppl who knows what they are doing (mostly).   And in the end winrate speaks for itself.

hma5fsj,flipswitch,11/27/2021,1,372.0,I feel like one thing cosplay consistently gets wrong is the hair color is too light and saturated. Obviously blue hair isn’t ‘natural’ but going darker and having slight variations of hue in it would go a long way to making it feel more realistic.

hmab0go,BLHXsuperman,11/27/2021,1,52.0,There was a pretty bad situation between the two with one of the Doinbs channel mods who is supposedly Doinbs wifes friend talked trash about Tians performance. The community didnt like it and started bashing Doinb for keeping her and not backing up Tian then the main controversy came later on when that mod donated a large sum of money along with a message that talked shit about Tian Doinb read that donation out loud Chinese community was outraged about this saying he is willing to do anything for money made a huge drama between the two Doinb lost a ton of followers eventually I believe Doinb apologized and the two seemingly wrote it off but the Chinese community dont think so.   This along with one of the past clip that had Doinb (imo jokingly) said Tian shouldnt be given Fmvp for the year they won worlds have made the Chinese thinks that the two dont like each other accusing Doinb as a backstabber and it is also one of the main reason why his reputation is pretty bad in Chinese community right now.

hmajkh7,PixiCode,11/27/2021,1,20.0,resistances are still good mid-early game especially vs. shadowflame or lethality items.
hm9x8kz,howtopayherefor,11/27/2021,1,20.0,Theyre incentivized not to buy those items because thats wasted gold not because those items are inherently too strong for those champions. Would Vladimir with Liandrys be game-breaking? I mean he always bought the previous Liandrys so the concept of a DoT item on him isnt crazy.   For the following calculations lets assume 50% conversion rate.  * Frozen Heart has 400 mana which is equivalent to 560 gold. This is converted to 105 HP. So Frozen Heart on Garen would be 20 AH 105 HP and 80 armor. Randuins is 10 AH 250 HP and 80 armor. Is that gamebreaking? * Seraphs Embrace has 860 mana which is equivalent to 1204 gold. This is converted to 225 HP which would result in 80 AP and 475 HP. Rylais is 90 AP and 350 HP. Or we convert it to (860/21.75/2=) 20 AP for so Seraphs becomes 100 AP and 250 HP. Is that gamebreaking?  You say it completely breaks the balance of the game and invalidates the item system but you give zero arguments or explanations for why that would be the case. It only buffs resourceless champions by widening their item pool which in practice would mean Kennen might buy a mythic item with mana rather than being bound to mythic items without mana. To reiterate: there are barely any mana items anyway.

Even autopiloting after that many games he should at least be silver/gold yet hes almost in iron.
hmb3b3o,LoLrovex,11/27/2021,1,341.0,Most people in low elo wont accept the fact that theyre in low elo because of their on individual skill. If ego isnt the case then just searching for content on youtube to access any education content will help you tremendously. Another trick for junglers is just full clearing every game and you will probably climb like that but I dont suggest it if you want to improve at the game.

hmae3xe,xGlaedr,11/27/2021,1,310.0,His familys privacy DOES affect him having to tell his coworkers. He doesnt owe them shit beyond family emergency. No one year of working together doesnt mean youre entitled to know what happened to someone from my family. Holy shit people here are deluded and detached from reality.  Wheres the basic respect for Upset by the way?
hmaflen,DoorHingesKill,11/27/2021,1,,> and they side with him for this.  Yeah Yamato was pretty big on taking sides! The guy was told the entirety of the gruesome things that were brewing back at Upsets home and then comments on it later with yeah I respected his choice and then moved on cause whats done is done and we had to play 12 hours later.  The fact that he even words it like that already tells me everything I gotta know about his side. If people close to me had some bad shit happening that required them to drop everything and hit the airport right away I wouldnt even refer to it as a choice lol.
hma6m31,Klaymoor11,11/27/2021,1,13.0,Ive seen many new players coming to LoL after Arcane dropped whenever I see one struggling in my games I add them in order to help them learn the game. They usually drop it because its too much to learn which is kinda sad but true.

hm9xzgv,TheSoupKitchen,11/27/2021,1,53.0,HoB is nearly identical in winrate (slightly bettet) and PTA is arguably his best Rune.  Lethal tempo is intended for long drawn out fights (of which league gets less and less every year with more damage...) HoB and PTA are for burst and since twitch is more about stealth and burst right now Id say Lethal tempo is fine but the other 2 are better.

hmb3kgg,dsffff22,11/27/2021,1,147.0,Actually the Upset situation is a management failure by Fnatic. Upset should not have to clarify anything nor care about what other people think and Adam should have gotten answers to his questions from the Fnatic management.

hmalcph,Outfox3D,11/27/2021,1,,Kalista and Ashe are best case users IMO: able to stick to a target want to take an exteded trade after dont need the extra laning power that could be granted by another rune but benefit from the range and AS granted by Tempo.  Vayne is a solid user but she sacrifices laning power for it and her single-target-at-a-time approach favors PTAs damage amp. It (PTA) performs better overall and just feels great in laning.  Jinx is another good choice - and late game the extra range helps her out quite a bit and gives a boost to hurricane. She doesnt get a lot of use out of it in lane but with the loss of old LT and with Conqueror being meh on ranged she doesnt have a another option. Its worth noting that with a bit more power in stats itll be probably be her best-in-slot but wouldnt be if old LT still existed.  I dont actually know if Aphelios can wind it up with severum Q but if he can hed likely be alright with it though PTA offers much stronger laning.  And lastly Kog. For the same reasons as Jinx but he might have trouble keeping it up when BaB is down. Theres abposaibiliry of some form of Navori build opwning this up for him but Tempo really sosant give enough AS by its lonesome to fuel the AD heavy build.  A more generic Caitlyn build might like it in the late game though with HoB cheese just now disappearing and new mechanics on the horizon its impossible to say what her rune setup will be. Tweaking the ASUs mechanics changes means shes too in flux to judge but its likely shell have trouble sticking enoigh to activate it without a tank to wind up on ... at which point PTA is better at busting.   Things like Tristana and Kaisa wont use it as long as HoB exists and synergizes much better with their trade pattern (once youre all-in you dont really need extra ranfe over extra stats). Once Xayah stops being lethality (if xayah stops being lethality) shell likely use HoB or Fleet over Tempo since it just doesnt give good stats she wants and doesnt enable the same wave control it used to. Her trades are really just extended burst windows and while a feather combo can lock soemone down to wind up youre out of steam after you burn through clean cuts so always on isnt necessary. Theres no way Lucian or MF drops PTA in their crit builds.

hm9uyr8,TheUnk0wnDead,11/27/2021,1,4.0,False information. All prestige skins from 2020 and 2021 whether from the prestige shop initially or from events will be available at the prestige point shop for 2020 prestige points at the end of the year including the upcoming Brand prestige skin from the next event.  The catch is that they wont have a border like you normally get when you earn them.
hm8zoiu,datprocess,11/27/2021,1,199.0,Ive never really liked the rework at all if possible to check right before his rework and after you can see I did not play him anymore and I was on my way to mastery 7 with him :(
hmazrx2,TTUPhoenix,11/27/2021,1,,I think thats the reason for the big change in how tanks feel since the item rework even if theyre statistically doing well or at least okay.  In previous seasons that period from 1-3 items was where tanks where strongest because the carries were still getting their core items online and didnt have the ability to get serious penetration yet.  Mages had their mana item (maybe 2) then often wanted deathcap or needed morello while ADCs had IE/ER and then their zeal item.  Going pen before 3rd item was often not practical.  Now however void staff LDR and Seryldas are pretty viable as 2nd item on a lot of champions allowing them to enter the first big teamfights with penetration online.

hmallq6,CreativeAd481,11/27/2021,1,40.0,If you look at the Winrate stats it turns out that every soul is actually approximately the same power level with the exception of the Chemtech Soul which is significantly more powerful. So dont feel too bad about getting Cloud or Ocean since it doesnt actually affect your chances of winning the game by that much.

hmax1zu,Random_Stealth_Ward,11/27/2021,1,86.0,> Since midgame to lategame its still applied very fast. Unless the ADC is a Runaan user it will indeed be mono target.   Fair enough although tbh i expected runnan to not apply it since abilities like Ezreal Q or GP Q dont count towards the 3 autos necessary.  > And idk about the 50% threshold. Tanks may not be able to put them below it themselves but in a teamfight setting would it matter ? Their backline is supposedly dealing the needed damages.   Yeah but if the enemy isnt attacking the tank/bruiser then the GW wouldnt be applying unless we make it apply to slows and inmobilizations. For example lets say a Darius or Vladimir is attacking your team with current Thorn you can apply it to them by ccing them but with this change you wouldnt be able to apply the 60% gw yourself.  Perhaps you could make a combo of the 50% threshold and keep the inmobilization passive on a cooldown but that still is a nerf to tank users overall.

hmaetao,Tski3,11/27/2021,1,79.0,I think hes saying when they were on the same page as a team ot was short lived and they spent more time dysfunctional as to how to play the game.
hm9sws1,FetishMaker,11/27/2021,1,226.0,Your edit made it look like you where hounded with replies and theres literally only 2 mentioning it might be mirrored...
hmb242x,Arkaidan8,11/27/2021,1,,Dude you cant abuse that bug you can literally get permabanned for it and again ITS A BUG.  That said it doesnt matter whether you have Galeforce or Kraken once an AD carry has IE LDR and once a mage has Voidstaff there is no such thing as lasting more than 5 seconds. I dont know if you are still playing in preseason 11 but juggernauts cant ignore anyone their itemazation got demolished and until they change the armor/mres fromula or add more % damage reduction/health items its gonna stay that way.
hmaa63e,_Vastus_,11/27/2021,1,311.0,> Adam: voices his frustrations thoughts and experiences in an online post  If by this you mean: makes an inflammatory tweet where he says that Upsets circumstances are nothing simply because he wasnt told basically forcing Upset to come out and say anything to stop the vitriol thrown his (and his familys) way. Then yeah.  Not to mention that the majority of the body of text was that he felt he did really well and he felt betrayed that they would dare replace him (or look for replacement rather). I dont know how he thinks roster moves are made but usually to obtain a player another has to be removed and this is discussed with the staying players.  Either way I wont say that I cant understand Adam being frustrated but youre painting his post in a whole lot nicer light than it deserves. That post was Adam lashing out because of his frustrations and trying to defame Upset by putting out harmful speculation simply because he felt screwed with no regards of the consequences or what the circumstances may actually be like.   Even if the frustrations make sense his actions were highly immature.
hm9cb70,AureaMediocritas1,11/27/2021,1,15.0,??? his r healing got nerfed and his overall dmg got nerfed

hmaqd0f,Suspicious-Bus6351,11/27/2021,1,98.0,Scout and ShowMaker didn’t build Abyssal when they played Malz. Also the old passive only activated on immobilizes and Malz only has one. It’s just not a very good item for Malz.

hmanzhd,gjfrthvcghh,11/27/2021,1,28.0,Tanks are still strong champs. It’s just that riot gave them absolute dog shit mythic choices.   If riot just reworked tank mythics to have armor heavy and MR heavy versions we would see them in games again. It’s beyond stupid that we have to buy an early null magic mantle against an AD laner just to finish our mythic. Opponent literally gets a 450 gold advantage right off the bat just for not playing a tank
hmbbo6h,khazixian,11/27/2021,1,11.0,I have met many people who buy accounts purely for backups and alts for friends and ranked offpicks.   When you can get a ranked ready 15000 BE account for 4 dollars in less than 20 minutes it becomes super common real quick.

hma9mzo,fojek17,11/27/2021,1,10.0,baron has mechanics. Most of his skills are dodgeable for example  \-back spikes  \-tail knockup  \-creating three circular slowing puddles  \-that line travieling vomit-like skillshot  Auto attacks on the other hand should not be dodgeable as they are.  Drake still has some mechanics but much less and thats good because its suppoused to be easier to take.  \-knockup on waekup  \-standing correctly not to get hit by aoe auto attacks  And of course all of them have the mechanic of patience for resetting / keeping aggro

hmaj52v,Rasberry304,11/27/2021,1,231.0,I think there is no debate both Swain AND Fiddlesticks were watching the events. Fiddlesticks was watching for the amount of FEAR and Swain for INFORMATION. I dont think it really matters if its crow or raven since they both know from the game.  I think during the last episode at the table with Vi Cait and Silco tied up to chairs it was Fiddlesticks because the amount of crows (sorry I dont know the difference between the birds) was huge Fiddlesticks always has flocks of crows around him. Meanwhile Swain would most likely just send 1 scouting Raven which was perhaps when Jinx shot it when returning to their base where was the punching machine and shooting range.  Its funny I didnt notice this during watching the entire show but then I was rewatching the interactions from game and it clicked... Its really cool Detail bravo Riot.

hma3z1f,AalfredWilibrordius,11/27/2021,1,7.0,You generally just play to win lane until 14min unless you secure a really good timing  For example you shove the wave recall then youd walk back to lane because you have time because you shoved but instead you see bot lane having a clown fiesta so you tp bot kill then recall again and walk top  In games where you have premade teammates you can also do the same but then walk to dragon to secure it and then tp top. Of course this only works if your four other teammates are willing to follow up  The general trend is that you need to mind the position of the waves and make a value judgment of what youre losing vs what you can win ahead of time

hmb9oic,EgonThyPickle,11/27/2021,1,,Not really due to flat reduction being the first thing to be applied. So the only champions that can bring opponents below 0 MR with Abyssal are Corki and Rell since theyre the only ones with flat reduction in their kits.
hmascwk,reverent-girl,11/27/2021,1,15.0,MMR is not your problem. Your problem is your attitude. Statistically you will win on average 50% of your games you play. That being said with a small sample size losing 15 of 20 is very common. Your MMR probably has not changed much especially if you have played over 100 Aram games at some point in the past.   I would recommend taking a one week break from the game. If you are not having fun then your mental is not in the right place. Yah its fun winning but its also fun learning new champs watching other players do cool things or get a penta kill having friendly banter in chat etc.  I always have the most fun playing after a little break. Plz do yourself and your teammates a favor and take at least a week off. Why would you play something uou dont enjoy? If all you want is to win then play games that dont involve directly competing against other people.

hm9w8wz,delahunt,11/27/2021,1,1523.0,Ok so lets go over some basic facts.   Are you missing the part where she was a child? The fact she shouldnt have had those gems in the first place (i.e. Jayce should have had the dangerous illegal research material better secured Vi could have taken them from her or not told her to keep them secret from Vander). Or the fact that she was trying to help save the lives of people who were about to be murdered by a shimmered up rage monster?  Like yes she did the thing. She set off a bomb outside the wall of a secure room to save her sister her father figure and her two friends/brothers. Unfortunately it happened to be a much bigger blast than expected and the chaos from the blast caused fatal injuries.  I am not saying she doesnt have some part to play. But saying she is totally to blame as a child in that fucked up a scenario is kind of extreme. I am also aware that I am talking nuanced here. Like she killed them. Her actions led to their death. The situation just absolves some of the fault in it. It isnt like she intended to kill Mylo and Claggor. And considering what that shimmered up guy did earlier it is easy to see why the need for as big a bang as possible would be considered warranted.   I also think if Ekko knew the whole story hed not hold those deaths against her. I just doubt he ever did get the story.

hmb173g,MoonDawg2,11/27/2021,1,,> I dont think Galeforce is trash thats a bit extreme. But theres a lot of hyperbole going on in this post anyway which is usually what happens whenever this sub gets on the subject of ADC balance  I agree honestly. Its just annoying that people on this sub ignore any issues on adc because they remember that one time an adc was 15-4 and did actual damage while the entirety of high elo agrees that the role is horrible.  Honestly this threads are better for venting as an adc main vs actually having a discussion since that is usually impossible with people
hm99lfn,WintersEnvoy,11/27/2021,1,6.0,Jgl or Mid     Supps not that impactful but its pretty easy to learn and play and supps youll face will (often) be legitimately a lower caliber of players than in other roles especially pre dia

hmb325a,SaulJoker,11/27/2021,1,,But then you get melted by % hp damage right? Because you’re stacking health? Sure you can argue you’d take less % physical damage but that doesn’t stop % hp magic damage (*cough* Liandry’s *cough* Demonic). You’d get shut down by any AP champion who can avoid you getting to close to them or even other AP Juggernauts like Mord.  I take it the main champs you play are Nasus and Cho yes? On those champions it makes sense to buy Thornmail and Nasus is the only one that’s unable to benefit from the 60% grievous so I understand your frustration in that regard.   But the item is fine it’s a TANK item and tanks are expected to have CC to compensate their lack of damage output. Juggernauts compensate their lack of CC with damage. Nasus is in a weird spot where he doesn’t really want chempunk because he just wants to be tanky as he scales infinitely but he doesn’t really want thornmail either because he can’t apply the 60% grievous wounds.  The solution in coordinated play is to play an enchanter alongside Nasus and have them build putrifier. But of course this is less applicable in SoloQ.  And no there is no argument for Darius to not build Chempunk. His passive literally synergizes perfectly witth it. The only scenario where I could see it working is vs. a literal full AD team that has little to no magic damage and even then you’re probably better off getting a different armor item.

hm90zc5,Head_Haunter,11/27/2021,1,196.0,I dont know the exact details but he got stuck at gold 1 for a while. Like several weeks despite playing 8 hours or more a day.   Like 300 or 400 games. Dont quote me on that I just know it was like a shitton of games.   I kind of mentioned it earlier but part of the reason is because he was playing on a brand new account with brand new MMR so he never got to skip any divisions or got any high LP gains. Every game was like 15 LP gain and 14 LP loss so if he had a 50% winrate over 20 games it would have been a net of like 20 LP for 20 games which is excruciatingly slow.   Another reason Gold 1 was a huge hurdle is because there are a lot of smurfs in Gold 1 because a lot of those people naturally decay to around there. Its just the most common smurf elo.

hmab7he,XiaoRCT,11/27/2021,1,313.0,family emergency simply doesnt cover enough. You explain to your team what happened.   Id bet on a lot of people being mad if family emergency for leaving his team hanging at worlds meant my wifes grandma passed away and she was having a tough time because it would be a shitty reason. Obviously family emergency might also mean something way more tragic that would justify Upsets position.   The issue is exactly how vague it is not for us the public but for his own team at the time.

hmane3j,ParagonEsquire,11/27/2021,1,76.0,No I get that. But since the game takes place before then and the visual novel makes her into an idiot traitor that gets easily murdered after the game it makes a lot of what the game does feel pointless

hmafxzu,TuxSH,11/27/2021,1,13.0,It scales off your **bonus** mana as opposed to the other two tear items.  You gain **0.5%** of bonus mana as AH before 360 stacks raised to **1.3%** of bonus mana after 360 stacks.  Before 360 Tear stacks it gives about 4.3 AH without a Lost Chapter mythic and 7.3 AH with one despite building from Kindlegem.  You should never start building the item until youre about to have those 360 stacks.

hm9xejt,fojek17,11/27/2021,1,31.0,Its insane how many games Ive lost because someone was just bitching to ff instead of playing. Even with a 0/7/0 top laner the games were ez wins if our 4/0 mid laner was playing instead of spamming ff rage splitting and bitching in chat. And I know that these are winnable because when I get a team of people who dont get a mental meltdown after getting oneshotted by someone but instead focus and play around fed enemies and teammates we win easily

hmatt7k,trapsinplace,11/27/2021,1,,Selling stuff to Chinese players isnt opposed to a winter map though. Other guy says business is booming and China is business but that doesnt explain why stuff like winter map cant exist.  If Riot were to sell map skins theyd likely turn China into an even bigger source of revenue alongside everyone else. Riot can sell just about anything and make boatloads of money. I dont see how business doing well in China relates to stuff like map skina though. It makes sense for champions and gameplay changes because those are what really keeps people in the game. But stuff like map skins? Emotes? No reason these are limited by a Chinese playerbase.  Business is booming all over for Riot and their lack of cosmetic features after all this time just makes no sense. Compared to DotAs cosmetics Riot is more than a decade old and compared to other non-moba games theyre still years behind. None of this is due to China players or revenue. If anything it should be done BECAUSE of Chinese revenue.

hmadik5,Both_Requirement_766,11/27/2021,1,568.0,sorry was mistaken. even if its just a small boundary I think the opness came from it being completely global.
hmaprpg,react_dev,11/27/2021,1,98.0,I also think there’s an inherent bias because he’s the newcomer and not part of the 2019 team he has the burden to prove himself to mesh with the team.   Also it sounds like FPX has a blame culture where they point fingers under the guise of joke / direct after scrims and that can’t be good for Nuguri.  In a corporate world speak he’s just not a culture fit. It’s not his fault. It’s also not FPXs. It just wasn’t meant to be.

hm9xc8v,TheSoupKitchen,11/27/2021,1,36.0,Its pretty good for Caitlyn Vayne Jinx and Kog. Basically all the heavy auto attacking champions that dont give a shit about ability damage and scale for late game. In that regard Id say its great.  I do agree its REALLY good for melee auto attacking champs and arguably *better* for them than it is the ranged champions.  I have SO many problems with ADC. Seriously. If you spend enough time on this sub youll see me ranting and complaining about ADCs and how garbage of a state theyre in. The fact that every role got new items and stuff to mess around with and ADCs ONLY GOT LETHAL TEMPO speaks volumes for the preseason. Riot hates this role I swear. But i dont think its what I would personally complain about for the role.  Lets at least be consistent and accurate in our assessment of the garbage role that is ADC. This isnt it...

hmaq8ko,Zeddit_B,11/27/2021,1,12.0,They were drafting in the client and one of the players didnt have all champions (probably playing on an alt?). So they would draft Annie and type what the champ was finish the draft then restart and everyone picks their champs.

hmb32fw,BHowe1205,11/27/2021,1,81.0,we literally have tweets from before the backlash saying that only the major story beats are canon and not the actual specifics of any dialogue since that was all up to player choice. the rookie is one of the major story beats that is canon we know this for a fact because rioters have gone on record saying yes the rookie is 100% canon but the dialogue options you choose for him are not. the rookie is a character who helped the sentinels as they traveled runeterra recruited the members and eventually fought viego. no amount of mental gymnastics will change that  &#x200B  its not riots fault that people like you twist or even completely ignore what they say to suit the circlejerk narrative that this sub pushes about what is and isnt canon  &#x200B  reav3 comment stating that the story beats included in the VN are canon but specific interactions between characters arent (the one people reference about riot trying to retcon after the event was received poorly): [https://twitter.com/spideraxe30/status/1419739830045614082?lang=en](https://twitter.com/spideraxe30/status/1419739830045614082?lang=en)  &#x200B  reav3 comment from 10 days before about 1 week after the event started and before the backlash really began stating the same thing - that there is an overall canon narrative of events but that specifics in both the VN and other mediums are not necessarily canon: [https://twitter.com/spideraxe30/status/1416134070086606862?lang=en](https://twitter.com/spideraxe30/status/1416134070086606862?lang=en)  &#x200B  Reav3 even acknowledges that using the term canon caused a lot of misunderstandings but you can clearly tell what he means by everything. its obvious that he never changed his stance he just clarified it but somehow this sub cant look at dates or comprehend that hes saying the same thing just more clearly
hma4xhq,CreepyMosquitoEater,11/27/2021,1,72.0,Its so indescribably broken on melee champions that use attack speed. Yasuo Master Yi Tryndamere and even Udyr top i saw abusing it. How did they ever think that 90% attack speed at level 1 would be anywhere close to balanced?
hm9lki6,TH3RM4L33,11/27/2021,1,230.0,Thats a common floating bug on all champions. From my experience it only happens locally so others dont actually see you floating. If it happens restarting your game should fix it.

Chinese league gets strengthened by taking young Korean talent pool + veterans while Korean league gets weakened by talent pool going to China NA EU Japan and others. At least this year not that many from LCK went abroad except for 4-5 players but you still have strong people like Viper Tarzan Scout Kanavi Summit etc in other leagues.

You shouldn’t lose at every point of the game to those champs on every champion. It could even be changing your starting item. There’s lots of ways to combat those champs. Now I’m one of the biggest one’s is CC and focusing your cc towards those champs. Akali Camille Zed and LB don’t do much when cc locked or being threatened by being CC locked. Don’t layer your cc all at once either chain cc

Viper is like the opposite plus Scout is there to carry the translation most of the way. I think maybe if they switch teams Viper can still succeed on FPX and Nuguri would have been able to find success on EDG because they were a more welcoming environment.

hmb28d9,TheRealPiggynator,11/27/2021,1,38.0,Sorc boots are unironically a good buy since your spike dmge is so small that +18 pen does a lot for your dmge. People who downvote you dont realize that rammus W gives so much resistances that building a lot more of it is just wastig stats the diffirence between 300 and 600 armor is non existent and a waste.  TheBausffs usually builds thornmail into sorc boots and riftmaker on Rammus and riftmaker is also a strong buy because your spike dmge now does part true dmge rammus  has good ap scaling and all your spike dmge is single target and gives you a ton of sustain with the omnivamp if people are hitting you. Same reason why void staff is good.

hmabpud,howtopayherefor,11/27/2021,1,49.0,Players in the beginning are really awful. I started playing LoL like almost a decade ago and I remember it being quite common for teammates to complain about kill stealing or to completely give up because one person was playing badly so I guess that hasnt changed. Right now I still sometimes see dickheads but things do get better. It really helps if you can have friends to play with

hmbbcxy,EvyLuna,11/27/2021,1,354.0,Yes but that doesnt indicate a change in skill gap. I understand the way the rank percentages have changed but you cant extrapolate skill gap data from that solely based on rank distribution.

hmao780,DanteStorme,11/27/2021,1,85.0,I get what youre trying to say but your point doesnt make sense.  Its along the same lines as complaining that AD champs cant use ap items because not having ap scalings on their abilities makes them useless.  Its the same for thornmail champs that dont have cc cant use the 60% gw effect because they dont have cc abilities making it worse for them.  Some items are intentionally itemised like this to make it worse for specific subclasses.  Thats why there are so many items with different effects for ranged and melee champs. (demonic botrk etc) which is exactly the same example as this.

hmb2h8b,LoLrovex,11/27/2021,1,341.0,College league scene is definitely still developing but overall its a great experience. People can focus on education and school (how its supposed to work) and even though its not the best its still a starting point. The scene has been growing more and more each year since I got here and its pretty nice to see.

hmajxrw,ablack16,11/27/2021,1,8.0,It’s not difficult at all to counter her E. You just have to push towards her and have non predictable movement patterns. Or you stand by the creeps so if she hits you with it she pushes the lane. You are clearly upset about losing lane phase to her but xerath is honestly worse since he has 3 abilities that are fairly easy to land and a mana return but again countering ranged harass is only tough if you don’t force them to push or dodge and counter initiate and make them waste summoners. Get good lux is fine

hmbj6jb,WildQuantity9355,11/27/2021,1,163.0,I can say in terms of animation quality it can be argued that Arcane is one of the best animations made so far. The cinematography was breathtaking each frame could be a painting. On top of that the way expressions and micro expression were animated. I’m a big fan of Studio Ghibli flims and I can say Arcane’s animation quality rivals Studio Ghibli.
hma8lrd,EdwardCircumcizehand,11/27/2021,1,,Animation and modeling and general art are some of the few topics I have no knowledge about  All I know is that they did a great job and it took so long lmao  My favorite part was the emotions on the faces.

hmaw42j,neimengu,11/27/2021,1,112.0,I mean Viper 100% works harder at learning Chinese than Nuguri anyway dude looks at his notes for learning Chinese even when hes walking back to lane in solo queue. The work ethic is just different between the two players
hm9agou,brandonkillen,11/27/2021,1,13.0,I don’t care who gets the kill as long as they die but then again…if they are one shot and I’m about to land the killing blow and you flash and take it (I’m a mid) then I might get somewhat ruffled.
hma5mwo,BahLo-,11/27/2021,1,147.0,What a stupid ass take. So what you cant have a strong will if you retire in league without winning worlds? lmfao.
hm90bx4,Whiskeyjacks_Fiddle,11/27/2021,1,12361.0,I mean Summoners Rift/League of Legends doesn’t actually exist in the current (relaunched 2014) lore so you can definitely have canonically dead characters in LoL.  Side note - this also allows the writers to potentially kill off champs in Arcane and other media.
hmaqypz,Straight_Zombie5644,11/27/2021,1,139.0,Both can be problematic.  Melee having too much power with the rune and ranged not having enough.  More accurately ranged not having enough up front and too much on the back end.  When fully stacked tempo is insane on certain marksmen.  But until its fully stacked its shit and you might as well have no keystone

hm9wi2x,TheSoupKitchen,11/27/2021,1,69.0,Everyone chiming in that Tencent doesnt make decisions or tell them what to do is missing the point of the post. Its more about Riots priorities and where it lies with fans. Something like this snow map is arguably simple to make but goes a long way. Though jts obviously not going to generate profits which may be a reason why resources arent put toward something like this. Similar to why they dont invest a ton in making new game modes and maps. Simply because its enjoyed by a minority and maybe their limited resources are better elsewhere for whatever reason.   That being said I miss the snow map even if it would be bad for clarity in some (many) instances.
hm9l9if,Applepowdersnow,11/27/2021,1,2.0,afaik some prestiges will be buyable end of the year and some were just obtainable during certain events during the year.

hmabzue,Doggy_In_The_Window,11/27/2021,1,133.0,Could the turret agro be caused by her ugly not actually dealing damage until she’s once again targetable?  If this is the case it seems it could be intentional.
hmaawm0,Quaiche,11/27/2021,1,101.0,It has absolutely nothing to do with tencent

hmarxbx,5ait5,11/27/2021,1,90.0,yes it matters when he won because how good you were 5 years ago  has little to no standing on how good he is right now. Dope achievement tho :)
hmb81xv,pimpsquirrel,11/27/2021,1,209.0,Okay so 2 things are going through my head here:  1. Your friend learned to play the game through ranked and has now played so much ranked that the LP system fucked him up (you get much more lp for a win when u start playing ranked vs later). This LP issue gets people hardstuck especially so since it affects their mental state. In this case just make a new account for ranked (you can buy a level 30 account for cheap if ur too lazy to level it up) and rank up from there  2. Passively sabotaging himself - for the first year if playing I almost did not improve at all. You need to actively try and improve to improve which most people unknowingly dont do. Honestly best way to get out of that is waching videos like Skill Capped that help you develop critical thinking in-game and after that watching streams and plays made by good players on your main champions. When I started watching Taco I pasisvely ended up improving at Jhin with rvery video because it heloed me realise all my champ can do and what his limits are/how to play into what matchup. This promoted me to think more in game myself and try what I saw.  Hope this is helpful :)
hma3ma6,Quirky_Lychee_693,11/27/2021,1,47.0,Pseudointellectual take. Heres an analogy.   If I enjoy going to theater that doesnt mean I have to enjoy watching every single play ever made. I also dont have to sit until the end of a shitty play I dont enjoy.  This guy is acting smug about watching until the end of the very worst plays put on stage and scoffs at people who want to leave while jerking off how cool he is for sitting until the end of every garbage play.
hmartbu,catseye013,11/27/2021,1,129.0,I mean there are people doing it for free lol. Riot could legit just pay them like 50 dollars then put it in the game.

Plus people and pros want to try for the new maps and soul so dragons are prioritized for soul point. I’m currently playing in some semi serious inhouses of master-chally players and games are ending 30-35 min tops but you see top mid and ad have tons of income by then

hma41ps,csudoku,11/27/2021,1,13.0,Its more of the thing if you want to play the game because you like arcane you shouldnt play. You should play the game because you are genuinely interested in playing the game because it is NOTHING like the show. There is no story and all the outlets from learning about the characters are honestly found outside of the game itself.

hmatkkk,markson852,11/27/2021,1,112.0,You cant expect someone to be able to change his personality just because he is getting a 2.8mil pay. He had a history of getting bullied during his childhood and is extremely introvert. One should have expected it would be hard for him to learn a new language and taking the initiative to talk.The team should have done a brief background check on the player(just have someone go through those DWG videos or Nuguris namuwiki) before offering fat check to a player.

hmaf9yw,Frakcherd,11/27/2021,1,1845.0,Jayce is shown to be physically capable hes worked as a smith his entire life as a child he used to play with a hammer the size of him that wasnt powered by hextech (which seems to make objects lighter). Also its a lot easier to dodge a punch than you think if youre concentrating on the person in front of you. When hes using the hammer form hes only got to worry about his front and back because hes on a bridge. Also its easy to aim an explosion.   I feel like the enforcers probably couldnt help their weapons were shown to be ineffective against the Chemtanks so theyd likely have done other things (Like round up the workers and try not to get killed) while the two people who were capable of damaging them fought. The lack of clarity with positioning also makes sense as it gives you the feeling that the focal point of the fight Jayce doesnt know whats going on. It helps to emphasise the fact that hes in the fog of war all the way up until he kills the kid. Its an immediate snap back to reality with the establishing shots of the positions of everyone else.

hmb9uwi,daswef2,11/27/2021,1,,>sup leave the ad on an island since everyone has pretty much figured out how useless an adc gets without solo exp and island farming and yuumi can just attach to someone else (jg most of time)  This kinda reminds me a little bit of ardent meta where getting enchanters big is probably more important than getting your adc ahead.  What ive seen a lot of is enchanters sitting in lanes trying to scale and then tank supports heavy roaming because the 2v2 has no kill pressure against enchanters.

hmaoxc1,SylerTheSK,11/27/2021,1,76.0,Pyke and MF are done so impossibly bad in the sentinels event that there is no way its canon.  I know that a rioter said the overall story is real just not any of the interactions. So Im head-canoning that the only real parts are Viego rising again Viego getting imprisoned again and Thresh taking over. No one outside of Ruined King is involved and anything else that comes out concerning this is just fanfic to me.

hm9z051,TheSoupKitchen,11/27/2021,1,53.0,Its always nice to read other ADC players express their frustration accurately.  I feel like I found a brother. :)  Its time to role swap. This season they literally gave every other role new items and runes to play with and ADCs ONLY GOT LETHAL TEMPO. Even if you look at it PURELY FROM AN ENTERTAINMENT PERSPECTIVE they gave every position something new and fun to experiment with and ADCs got fuck all. If you needed any more of a sign to change roles now is the time.   Just my word of advice. I wholeheartedly agree with you.  Of my 10+ years of adc. The last 3 years of ADC have been without a doubt the worst its ever been. And it seems to keep getting worse.

hmav94q,LeFiery,11/27/2021,1,149.0,Reason the snow map dont and wont exist (anymore) is because of the drakes. For something once a year its too much work to keep it updated. It probably means every new pre-season were gonna get new drakes every year.   For the rest of the stuff who fucking knows. Theyve been saying the same shit for years. Maybe with the success of arcane well start seeing that kinda thing.   Also snowdown skins apparently proved to be meh-selling skins so they stopped and changed it to other themes.

hma5e25,anaf28,11/27/2021,1,13.0,If it’s a matter of which game to recommend that is more connected to Arcane that’s one thing but what I’m trying to say is if they feel the urge to try out League of Legends and want to get into it why scare them away? Welcome them to the game let them give it a try. It’s free to play and if toxicity gets to them or if they’re not satisfied with the gameplay they can quit at any time.

Easy champ with a really forgiving yet still fast clear who can again carry hard. Really good for learning jungle. If you’re playing mid Annie has a relatively low skill floor and a pretty high skill ceiling. If you’re playing bot Miss Fortune is a solid pick and you get her from the beginning but if she isn’t to your taste Sivir is very easy and can again hard carry games. If you’re playing support I personally like Sona. If you’re good at MOBAs you should learn pretty quickly and champ knowledge comes naturally with time.

hma3sn8,delahunt,11/27/2021,1,12388.0,Jinx was always going to be a bit problematic in showing the descent hopefully they didnt do it too poorly.  The other part is Jinx from the beginning of episode 1 until Silco tells her she is perfect is obsessed with one thing: being good enough. This is what Mylo is constantly teasing her about in the first two episodes telling Vi that Jinx is 1/2 as good as Vi was at her age and a burden and well a Jinx.  Vi however believes in Powder and Powder wants to prove that she is worthy of that belief in her. Which is why she reacts so strongly to being left behind in Episode 3. Shes told shes not good enough and she wants to prove it. So she goes with the monkey bomb. It is also why she goes from elation (I did it! I saved you!) to despair (I was only trying to help! I was only trying to help!) Unfortunately that is when Vi says Mylo was right hits her then (from Jinxs perspective) abandons her.  Shes taken in by Silco the guy who lives by you have to prove your value by becoming what they fear. And he accepts her but when things go bad you can still see that old fear coming back up. The not good enough countered by the memory of Vi saying shes stronger than she knows and one day will find it. Which is why she goes for the gemstone raid to make up for the mess on the airship.  And that is basically the cycle. She wants to be good enough to be Vis #1 again like before. Only Vi is with Caitlyn. So Vi has moved on. And Silco has his machinations to handle.  And even without the madness just that obsession with wanting to be someones #1 something they wont abandon and discard explains every act Jinx takes. Again until she apologizes to Silco for fucking up again and Silco tells her Dont apologize. Youre perfect.
hm9ex0y,Caenen_,11/27/2021,1,26.0,Lots of time looking into stuff like this and friends that do the same with me.
hmb21xt,Toplaners,11/27/2021,1,208.0,Well my goal is to eventually climb very high on the ladder and being able to pull off every possible play will eventually be part of that its just a longer learning curve than just playing safer and climbing easier.

hmbin2k,Tear-Sensitive,11/27/2021,1,18.0,Sorry to hear about this. Ive played league 11 years now and I can say the toxicity is definitely the core problem with the community (check out voyboys old YouTube video here:https://youtu.be/KpTnmyECT4s).  Even though he is referring to ranked soloq it feels like this applies more to normal queues if anything. I dont blame you for leaving. I havent touched the game really in a few weeks regardless of ult spellboook being my favorite mode

hmaflcw,Caenen_,11/27/2021,1,138.0,Eve becomes untargetable before dealing damage but remains untargetable well after the damage is dealt. This prevents turret aggro...or so I thought.  Upon actually conducting a few tests on this its slightly more complex than that. Fizz also gains turret aggro if his E ends *very soon* after dealing damage to a champion (e.g. with R) even if he was untargetable at the time the damage was dealt. He will not gain aggro if he does not become targetable for longer than a fraction of a second after dealing damage.  Ill pay a visit to the notes I have on turret behaviour (turrets have more delays to their action than just attack windup) and with that might be able to explain it as a bug. Or its intentionally cased to not allow Eve to switch aggro in a dive without blinking out of turret range - which I dont think it is.

They told them that its a legit reason but they where trowing a childish tantrum because they demand to know the specifics. Fnatic could do exactly nothing about it if Adam/bwipo/nisqy didnt want to accept the decision of the rest of the team/org. Those 3 are now let go of and all gucci. There is no reason to even talk about his but Adam is still trowing a tantrum .

hmb6nkb,DankerinoHD,11/27/2021,1,,The original comment discusses the work ethic of players learning the language. You’re arguing that because Nuguri is “different” from Viper therefore people can’t expect him to learn?

hma5yjr,Quirky_Lychee_693,11/27/2021,1,47.0,so you say that wanting to surrender lacks empathy towards people that dont want to ff.  and casually ignore that refusing to surr lacks empathy towards people who want to surr.  game already needs 4/5 people to agree to surr. And never surr crowd is still whining because they think that their voice should outweigh LITERALLY THE ENTIRE REST OF THE TEAM.  Who lacks empathy here?  EDIT: also analogy not being perfect does not make it bad. Just like people who want to leave force other people to leave people who want to stay force other people to stay. It cancels out. Except never surrender crowd gets an advantage (2 no votes outweigh 3 yes) and have a superiority complex.
hmb2yah,chanleii,11/27/2021,1,206.0,Silver analysis and misinterpreting statisitcs
hm9aqla,musashihokusai,11/27/2021,1,9.0,Might have been true a few years ago but these days support is about as impactful as jg.   If my ADC knows how to shove and play safe I’m off ganking mid or invading with my jg.   Or if I’m feeling it I’ll just play something like Xer or Brand and turn bot into a kill lane.   If there’s a fasting Senna our team has two juggernauts.   JG- Easiest role to climb on. You see a lane winning camp and snowball. Play a duelist and invade unless premade no one is coming to help. AND once you get good at the role you might just auto win via knowledge check because it’s the most autofilled role.   Mid- Easiest lane to just afk farm and out rotate for objectives/teamfights. Least volatile so even when you get a Smurf you can play a little conservative and contribute to team.   Support- Essentially a second jg who doesn’t farm. Gank mid. Invade with your jg. Or pick champs like Brand or Swain and turn bot into a kill lane.   Top- super volatile. One bad trade might set you so far behind you’ve lost lane five minutes in. Every mistake is extremely punishable. Even when you get a lead you might lose it very quickly from split lapse in vision or unexpected roam.   ADC- In a premade very important but in solo queue your tanks WILL flash engage and leave you for dead. Expect zero peel and all the blame when you get dove by two assassins.   Mid then Support. In that order are the easier roles to climb on.

If Arams are a distraction and thereby a coping mechanism then who are you to question this?  _____ > If I wanted to play ARAM to take my mind off things I would start a new account and not use my main as that would bring unwanted attention to both myself and my team.

Played 1500 ranked games in season 3 & 4 afterwards perhaps 300 a year.   Nowadays i play with friends or play aram when bored.   So some weeks i play good 50 games and other times i dont play for weeks.   Do you have fun playing and do you have time to play are probably the best questions to ask yourself.
hmb1zhg,ZedisDoge,11/27/2021,1,205.0,you mean VIT Inspired and Hans since no other org could pay the buyouts?
hm9sz0r,TH3RM4L33,11/27/2021,1,237.0,Its smoother for the combo if you dont have to basic attack manually since the point of Q is to make you basic attack unless you cancel it on purpose (and R is not an ability that cancels basic attacks).  For example using R during ranged Q doesnt cancel the basic attack so the combo is smooth (meanwhile melee Q is the opposite for no reason). R not cancelling the attack is a good reliable behavior that everyone who plays Talon is aware of and agrees with it. Having to do it manually in a lot of action (hitboxes overlapping enemies dashing camera moving etc) is clunky and unreliable.

Adam thinks upset went to see his wife this means he thinks upset is bullshitting. Bwipo is dissatisfied with the answer as well.  You dont have to state the exact reason but if your teammates just says some vague reason and leaves then it shouldnt be surprising they dont trust you. Upset expects his team to understand and hyli does but Adam and bwipo are sceptical about the reason.

hm97q6x,Xonra,11/27/2021,1,170.0,A one off day sure. Then dont compare the two cause this was well over a single day. Not even sure you are aware of what you are trying to argue anymore you just want to be right so bad youve lost the script.
hm9hbsb,YUNG_GOD_X,11/27/2021,1,585.0,Is this true? What about Zed ult and Darius passive?

hma4tm0,Jamesd88,11/27/2021,1,41.0,Long-time lurker played SR since S1 but stopped around S7.  Did Riot permanently add portals to the game with this new season? Is this a Taliyah thing or do they appear after a certain amount of time has passed in the game or once a certain dragon or structure has been killed?
hmbe073,Euphoric_Violinist59,11/27/2021,1,4.0,this hasnt been working for past 4 days
hma0tba,Random_Stealth_Ward,11/27/2021,1,70.0,I think the idea is that the GW Proc may be seen as too strong if it was on any CC while the shield from fimbul isnt Probably because fimbul is a self-contained effect only applied on the user while thornmails GW arent and with how easily available Slows are it means everyone gets to apply the 60% with little compromise since slow effects are tacked on many spells specially on a ton of tanks.  For example if you are Poppy you get a 60% gw on every Q Nautilus presses E and a circle the size of an Amumu ult now gets 60% GW Tham in every Q Maokai throws a sapling and thats a 60% GW if you are Sion a tap Q or a minion E is the 60% GW since so many of these effects have a moderately big AOE or ranges along with lower CD to balance out their lower utility contribution it could be seen as too out of line.  Juggernauts just happen to be caught in the middle of this as a result of their designs
hmblma5,SkeletonJakk,11/27/2021,1,,Tell me what one of those champs has a banrate over 50%?

hm9t7he,swardeey,11/27/2021,1,175.0,Yea like hes a hardstuck gold player who used the mess pre season is. Next season will ne painful when he ends up with a 45% WR hitting g4 again. Like he played eve before all season and ended up g4 with Silver 1/2 mmr. Quite unlikely he randomly improved to that level within a week playing the same stuff

hm9z0yx,LKZToroH,11/27/2021,1,328.0,Its not. Its actually fucking not. Jinx is flat on top thats true but any scene where it shows her whole body like in the arcade when she was trying to beat Vis score you can see she is not that skinny. At least in Arcane in the game she is as flat as a piece of paper.   This girls body is actually quite close to the jinx we see in Arcane

hm9ym78,tanezuki,11/27/2021,1,70.0,Just like Gwen and Sylas.
hmau7nr,mediocrity_defined,11/27/2021,1,32.0,Riot did it with all of their scenes.  Dynasties and dystopia with jinx vs ekko  Snakes with vi and jayce  When everything went wrong with vi and sevika  Goodbye with end of act 1  Just because one wasnt received well doesnt mean the concept wasnt good. All of the above scenes were greatly improved with the music

hmagxou,Worldly-Duty4521,11/27/2021,1,79.0,Lck surely is the finals between EDG and DWK was one of the closest finals and even though dwk couldnt win a single international trophy this year they were far more consistent than any of fpx edg rng. Not to mention 4 Korean teams in quarter finals whereas only 2 of the lpl. It wouldnt be wrong to say if you hold another series between them its not necessary edg will cleanly or even win at all
hmatwn7,SamsungBaker,11/27/2021,1,65.0,From my experience its useless soul tbh   Ocean or infernal are far more impactful   Infernal literally make support so strong that they can do massiva dmg to ADC or mid in tf

hma0drn,Acceptable-Length140,11/27/2021,1,328.0,Shut up just shut the fuck up...
hmb7d1d,Mrmoi356,11/27/2021,1,,Bro I fucking main Fiora. I could give 0 shits about how Yone and Yas are doing because I can simply fuck them over with one ability the problem rn tho is that LT makes the cooldown for Q so small that they can beat anyone in a 1v1 duel at any stage as long as they are not behind.  Its broken af stop letting who you main get in the way of common sense. Yone literally has a 60%+ winrate in top lane currently. How are you going to argue that is in any way balanced?
hma1tei,NO_FNX_NO_MAJOR,11/27/2021,1,59.0,dont take most of what he said seriously though both of them dont really understand what they are talking about.

hmabxsn,Imperadise,11/27/2021,1,52.0,I mean u clearly didnt watch lpl because doinb domestically was considered the best midlaner in summer with knight being behind him
hmbfgnj,Nivelyx,11/27/2021,1,1.0,You are skipping some events that happened. Most likely the yi got fed of CHAMPION BOUNTIES which are the real problem.   People really need to wake up to how impactful champion bounties are too the game. An objective bounty gives u an extra 100-300 gold? the yi could get a 700g bounty of a champ kill.
hm9y5p1,Impressive_Finance31,11/27/2021,1,30.0,There is the same kind of bug fiddle effigies teleport with him after using an Hexgate but np they will fix this with another lux skin soon.
hmbgtss,Outfox3D,11/27/2021,1,303.0,Yeah even on its best case users its not gonna be the best choice for laning. Right now you can kinda cruise and just not fight because objective bounties will punish your opponent for overperforming in lane but I doubt thatll be the case for terribly long. Its a nothing rune in lane - especially compared to its old version.  Also yeah sad to see Aphelios Q doesnt stack it. I was reading on the aphelios sub that it doesnt stack at all from the extra autos from any of his abilities ... which is a bit of a ripoff since hed probably benefit from it better than most marksmen.

hm9crwq,moroheus,11/27/2021,1,172.0,Now youre projecting your insecurities again. Its pretty obvious you arent happy with your chin line
hmaryy4,ColdXStrikeR,11/27/2021,1,40.0,so what happened to scaling comps? I mean u basically rng some wins based on which team picked better or early game comps because the souls just give so much power while other souls are basically useless comparably
hmbfpu2,timmyctc,11/27/2021,1,153.0,I hate it but if theyre gonna persist with it you should have like -50%ms or -50% tenacity in zombie form.

hma9a44,FantasyTrash,11/27/2021,1,,You do realize no one was throwing any flame at Adam until he decided to air out **all** of Fnatic’s dirty laundry and essentially promoted people to harass Upset and his wife right? It was incredibly unprofessional.

hmax05j,realCptFaustas,11/27/2021,1,65.0,If its that close i think soul solves it except maybe cloud one anyway.  As for importance of early and mid game teams worldwide got better at it and focus on it more because game time is intentionally shortened (soul and elder).  And far enough ahead to secure soul and far enough ahead to end the game were not the same with stall and scale comps which are boring to watch and play you should look at it that from the perspective that some champions are bad cause they need gamelength thats no longer there and should be looked at   I have issues with the drake system and new drakes but its not scaling or gameending ability of them.

hmailbt,SkeletonJakk,11/27/2021,1,114.0,Funny that indescribably broken equates to sub-52% winrates on all of those champions.
hmb8i6o,CantReadGood_,11/27/2021,1,196.0,Not sure why hextech/chemtech can’t also be interpreted as foundational or just more recent manifestations of magic in the developing world…  Also unsure why you’d insist on pigeonholing runeterra into traditional fantasy tropes? Like it really doesn’t matter what foundational elements you’re used to. The periodic table was just an example of that. Elements in one world (our modern world) might not be the same as elements in other worlds (fiction or older human history). They could pull out completely different stuff that you’d just have to accept because this is fiction and you’re not the loremaster and it’s fine for both the world itself and the knowledge of those in the world to evolve.
hmarimf,RurouniMiyamoto,11/27/2021,1,4.0,Vlad super strong now. Cosmic drive gives free phase rush
hmabhnf,TrashAllRoles,11/27/2021,1,13.0,Played for a loooong time now. I never type and insta mute someone upon being toxic your enjoyment of the game will increase when you dont have to read the bullshit
hm9unnz,SoundWavingSleeper,11/27/2021,1,207.0,Good thing you can lazily just ignore or throw out any stats argument and pretend all statistics can be lumped together as irrelevant whenever you want by saying without context
hmbqlpt,zultari,11/27/2021,1,4.0,I like seeing these for awareness on bugs and to see who can one-up the previous bug list of a champ. No one comes close to old Mordekaiser though but this is neat.

hmbjy4w,NoremacEnrobso,11/27/2021,1,154.0,I barely won a game agaisnt that. It took 3 barons and two elders. Drag soul op
hmbr2nh,be_like_neo,11/27/2021,1,19.0,Dodging and afk penalty has nothing to do with griefers... At all. Its 100% because of the fact that accounts are so easy to buy. Theyre only 3 dollars. I have around 20 smurfs and I definitely will grief some games then switch to a different account if it gets penalized. A lot of people do the same as well.  Riot just needs to make accounts verified by cell phone so that if you get a penalty on one account it affects all accounts with that number. Or they just need to do a much better job at shutting down botted accounts. Thats it. Until then this game will always have toxic players. Also the leaver penalty is extremely lenient. Id be actually amazed if someone hit the 14 day penalty. I can leave 3 games in a row and all Ill have is a 5 minute wait in between games.
hma8788,Bungkai,11/27/2021,1,4462.0,He doesnt have to but his teammates dont have to trust him anymore either. Its not surprising for people whove worked hard to get to World to be angry with him
hma9s8j,Coolestdude123,11/27/2021,1,311.0,It wasnt a sudden medical emergency though because it was building for a few weeks. It was just as Adam said. She was lonely/depressed and had huge suffering (as Upset said). Then the day before worlds she starts getting more depressed and rings Upset crying. Then Upset decides he has to go home.  So the reason would seem shitty hence why he never told anyone.

hmbrmn6,JoshQuest1,11/27/2021,1,4.0,Re: The second bug    If you look in the first video youll see theres a yellow ring that appears under the monster falling asleep that is not there on a champion.    The missing effects from the star guardian skin are the reskin of that yellow ring which is a lot more pronounced in star guardian which is why you see it as wholly different.    Also Im taking this moment to say after all these years I still miss qqr. :(
hmblsdn,androt14_,11/27/2021,1,,Honestly I dont even mind the hate on Faker Im not a particular Faker fan either what made the guy annoying is calling the average League player a faker lover as an offense like.... why? was the whole point of it just bothering people because they like the personality and playstyle of a player? whats next gonna call someone edgelord for liking metal? gonna call someone a weeb for liking japanese animation? cant we just... not keep hating on people for liking things?

hma2fhb,MyGasYourBrain,11/27/2021,1,9.0,Strong disagree about tear items overall. Fimbulwinter is nice since it scales from current and maximum mana (HP/Shield) this means you get another use for your mana just by building it. Its not really for stacking mana items adding additional ones (like FH) just gets you another small boost. Looking at it from a stacking mana items perspective is to one-dimensional.
hma26a0,akutasame94,11/27/2021,1,,Well the last one got mad jg started top side so refused to leash then he died ti garen on level 3 Noc came by and got return kill and that was when the give up guy said  typical jg waits for me to die then comes so she proceeded mid gave a kill then came bot but I used her as a meat shield and got kills back so she just farmed jungle dove the turrets and so on.  So tell me why she gave up?

hm92c9v,CoolKnightST,11/27/2021,1,30.0,The entire itematisation of juggernauts never made sence in the first place. Juggernauts should be champions that build tank & deal damage. While tanks should be building damage while providing utility. The entire design was broken from the ground up when they tried to give juggernauts their own itematisation.

hmaassb,TuxSH,11/27/2021,1,26.0,What actually happens from what I can see is that you win a fight and take a bountied Baron Nashor: thats a 500-800 bounty on top of the 1500 gold value in other words: an increase from 33.3 to 53.3% in value. That or you can maybe sneak it in case of jungle diff.  Then if objective bounties are still not deactivated (especially before the two hotfixes) you take bountied turrets with the baron buff cashing in even more gold. Objective bounties cant be disabled when attacking any bountied objective.  That and even enemies that are very behind can problematic if they decide to do an hail mary and splitpush for bounties.

hmb7ycw,Odd_Play_5769,11/27/2021,1,,An anti tank item should not be perma 2nd item bought on every adc for an entire season regardless as to whether or not the enemy team even has a tank. To me thats overturned. Its like when Serpants was perma buy on every assassin most of the season before they nerves it regardless as to whether or not the enemy has any legit shield threats  Look Im an ADC main but even I can step back and say its too strong an item.

Especially how it ended with Silco saying that he would never sell her or betray her. I loved how he believed and trusted in his crazy daughter until the end. I just simply dislike jinxs as a character but thats a personal bias the writers did an amazing job at this season given what they had to work around.

I think I want to be an author for a living. Its not too stressful I can actually do something creative which Ive always wanted to do my entire life and it would be fairly easy to learn. Its just that those motivational issues are kicking my ass. I think you need to find something youre passionate about too though. Something you would genuinely enjoy doing for a living. Hone in on it and maybe you could sustain yourself with a well paying job doing something you enjoy at the same time.

There are even freaking teams that need to field sub players from their rival teams because of visa issues and they show up and try the best. Why did Adam and Nisqy think they are entitled to just run it down and dont give their best at worlds and blame others for it because one player of the team did not attend ? Especially if the Sub in Bean was having a pretty good showing.

If they choose to sign him and play with him they have to be prepared for the possibility he will jump ship again if something happens with his wife.   He will only play this game competitively for a fraction of his life. He hopefully will be married for the rest of it.

hmauw39,HrvatskaMilan,11/27/2021,1,147.0,Thank you for commenting!  Other people have pointed out azir’s ultimate bug. It is the most easily reproducable bug in the game i can think of you press it as you die. When you do this the wall will go out it will go on cooldown but it will pass through enemies do no damage not knock them back and it is not an obstacle.
hmargy3,NvmSharkZ,11/27/2021,1,94.0,Not at all 2d simply means the shapes have 2 dimensions lenght and width.

hma76ce,Snoo8331100,11/27/2021,1,145.0,Yeah the key difference here. We dont need to know but his teammates and management are a different story. Im starting to think it truly wasnt something significant enough to warrant leaving 12 hours before the tournament begins and he knew it. His teammates would support his decision if it was something serious Bwipo has a gf that he praises every day so theres no way he would be pissed if Upset told him the matter is really important. And then you have the stuff like Upset playing arams with his wife during Worlds... I still think Adam shouldnt bring this to public but his and Bwipos anger is completely justified.
hm9rka5,tmbosweettooth,11/27/2021,1,4.0,Interesting. I used to play Skarner top for fun but I am curious as to why you pick grasp as a rune? Also Skarner is really hard to cs with early game most champions can easily deny you cs. How do you deal with this?

hmag0ah,Fictitious1267,11/27/2021,1,44.0,Games like this trick your brain into thinking youre accomplishing things with your life. MMOs do this as well or any game with a ranking system or achievements. The normal human being has a craving for accomplishments involving improving their life like becoming proficient in music working on a business tilling their land etc. LOL hijacks that desire for self improvement and puts it towards something that has no meaningful benefit to your life.  I think thats important to keep into perspective when playing the game. You can play but dont give rank too much meaning. Work towards meaning in your own life with tangible things.  Never argue in game. People just weaponize it because they know Riot is a bunch of idiots that ban for words over actions. Mute everyone and play how you like.

Also on lvl up you can get champion shards which will let you unlock them at half the regular blue essence cost.  So if you get shards find the champion spotlight on YouTube of it and see if it looks fun.
hmab3a4,DaveidT,11/27/2021,1,313.0,Upset has said that he has shared with the entire team many times how hard of a time he was going through with issues at home. No he didn’t tell the entire team what was exactly happening but he DID share with them that he has been struggling. He also shared with key members of his team what the entire issue was.  If the people on the team had legitimate questions and concerns about him leaving they could have asked Yamato/Hyli. Their either didn’t or they did and they didn’t trust Yamato/Hyli AND didn’t trust Upset. Either way the way Adam handled his frustration was so bad. He just put things out to the public without concern of it’s repercussions.

hmb0h9i,Odd_Play_5769,11/27/2021,1,38.0,The broken thing about lord Dom is that I can stack the % hp dmg with cut down. How ridiculous is it that if Im an ADC with LDR and Cut-down I get to do 30% extra damage to you simply because youre a tank and built what youre supposed to lol. Not to mention the armor shred which is good against 3veryone and even as an ADC main I have to be honest the item is very overturned it should be situational if youre against a ton of tanks not must buy every game
hmad5bz,Both_Requirement_766,11/27/2021,1,101.0,thsts unproven at best. every company has at least the goal to accumulate money. and even I like tencent. but since the great buy-out from 2015 there is a swing. riot gathers fewer modders to produce any customer skins (yes they still produce custom ideas but on a way different route). where you can see it at best is the defenitely-not skins april-fools skins and almost every skinline related at least to xmas got curbed down significantly (same goes for the old winter xmas map never seen again since 2015).  I like the replacement skinlines like bloodmoon or all around moon-fest or new year skins within the asian regions. but like I said 2015 they curbed down a good chunk of skinlines that dont seem to sell so well in the east. its a pity.

hm9864d,WeirdChamp960,11/27/2021,1,27.0,The bounties usually kick in at maybe 3k gold lead (my experience). If you arent able to pick up any of Tower/Drake/herald because of a gold diff thats only 3k then its not a design flaw. Yes the enemy ist stronger and it can be hard to get them but in almost all games you will be able to get outer turrets or go for herald while they do drake. They are collected atleast once in most of the Games I have seen this far. When behind or ahead in both cases Objective bounties have been taken in most games. A 3k lead doesnt mean you are so far behind that taking anything off your opponent is unlikely

hm96c0k,brokerZIP,11/27/2021,1,38.0,I think you are right. Chainsword is almost useless because you finish exe/bramble as 5th or 6th and building chainsword feels odd compared to thornmail. Because at this stage you have to have resistances because everyone can 2tap you consideering the amount of percentage damage. Chainsword is great as a 2nd Vs some insane healing but delaying your steraks or something like hydra is so shit and puts you behind as well as dumpstering your lead

hmboyna,Akait0,11/27/2021,1,417.0,I said that Adam got screwed over and nowhere did I say that he couldnt be as angry as he wants to.  Totally understandable to be mad. Now going to social media to vent and also speculate about Upsets reasons? Absolute inmature behavour.   Wanting to know why is perfectly reasonable. Being owed an explanation? Beyond family issues not really no. No one is owed an elaborate explanation beyond that. Not even FNC but if Upset didnt explain to management/coaching staff why hed most likely get fired so he did give one to them.   But reddit loves drama and wants to know -for different reasons- why Upset left so here we are siding with Adam.
hm9gr1w,GunnerPup13,11/27/2021,1,32.0,Honestly I really like LoL. I’ve been thinking of getting back into it but I’m not sure on it. I’ve got a few friends that still okay but at this point. It’s almost like the experience jaded me towards the game.   I look at it like the new Call of Duty games. Some have been alright some are just garbage. This most recent one is just garbage to me. The characters are boring and they admit they wanted to make this game like a movie and I’m sorry but Call of Duty isn’t a movie. It’s just gross. They did a World War 2 style game beautifully with World at War. It was period correct and just stunning. Now it feels like a cheap cash grab and I can’t stand playing the game. The experience has just gone downhill for me and I don’t want to play it.

hmabbc0,howtopayherefor,11/27/2021,1,24.0,Theres a major difference between the game is not balanced to account for that and the game would be unbalanced if that were the case right? Your point used to be that mana conversion would be game breaking or invalidate the item system but I havent seen any good example or reason for that happening.  Maybe theres a specific combination of items that would make a manaless champion too strong but that we could only figure out after playtesting sure. I doubt the AH from Liandrys would skyrocket Vlad into S tier. But any such oversight (if any) can obviously be fixed and wed still have the benefit of widening item builds for manaless champions and introduce new legendary items with mana to make mana scaling on tear items make any sense.

By the time he was diamond he had a solid grasp of his champs. Before that was a crapshoot. That’s why his top and jungle challenge he was barely above 50% up until diamond.
hmbnw4n,TuxSH,11/27/2021,1,70.0,> So it is very hard to argue that Axiom isnt the best item for Pyke to have here with scaling in mind  Umbral Glaive with Zombie Ward has more utility and is safer probably better to go for that if youre learning how to play Pyke.

hmahu48,GiandTew,11/27/2021,1,160.0,tibbers isnt as important to annie once its out as maiden is to yorick or daisy is to ivern because tibbers is great for the initial stun burst and then tibbers is insane for a bit but after that hes quite tame daisy gives cc and maiden late game quite literally turns yorick into a 1v1 god

hmb13pz,LoLrovex,11/27/2021,1,341.0,Given your current situation I would just say play more! If you have a nice winrate then it means youre doing something right. When you get hardstuck 50\~53% w/r then its time to re-evaluate.
hmbh62j,happygreenturtle,11/27/2021,1,303.0,Its not shit on 90% of ADCs?   The item has highest pickrate with over 50% WR on Draven Ashe and Vayne. Shieldbow also gets taken on Jinx with success at an 8% pick rate. Lower than Kraken and Galeforce but still gets picked and still performs well.   You could probably look through most of the ADC roster and see they do fine with it. I just dont have time or Id look into it more myself

hm9d286,H4SK1,11/27/2021,1,14.0,Strongly disagree. Vex passive was down. Kayn didnt have form yet. They legit have only Yasuo q as cc. Basically they need Azir to not be able to r and Rakan fail r into w combo to win that fight. I would say the risk is way too high and not worth it here. Just play it a bit slower wait for vex passive up again and gwen to get there is much better.

(you dont need to be good to get some viewers i know silver/bronze players with avg 50 viewers).  playing with friends/viewers could help here aswell.     Sometimes it can help to just take a break for a few weeks and then get back to it again. <- this ive heard helps the most.     If neither streaming nor a break helps then it might be time to switch the game.

hmbmxvc,PaulTheIII,11/27/2021,1,12.0,Because she’s a 1v1 champ that beats nearly everyone in a duel you’re most likely going to need to send two to deal with her.  But even champions aside just think about a scenario where it’s 25 minutes in both teams are posturing around the midlane + river area for dragon. If you commit to dragon they can just walk over and knock down mid turrets die very fast at that point. And vice versa. That’s a play that happens a ton in games because trading objectives is how the game plays out when you aren’t strong enough to contest them.  Also if your ahead you **always** should commit to dragon otherwise you’re going to have a very hard time closing out the game before they scale up to you over time. Again the enemy team can grab the objective bounty while you are

Or even just continue to stomp in nearly every game at least one person finishes with a bounty in them.  Objective bounties you **cannot** play around. You can’t defend all three lanes and both rivers at once. They’re going to be collected no matter what. Once midgame rolls in the entire point of the game is objectives. Unless you’re spawn camping them they have access to the map and can simply trade objectives and proc the bounty.

Even the whole ADC 2k18 fiasco when some non-marksmen started getting some action in botlane happened as a result of ADCs being super overbearing during season 5 6 and 7.

Riot tries to balance accounts to have a 50 win rate so if your win rate is high youll likely have mates with a lower one.    The more you win the more your MMR can increase giving you better teammates but people int or throw even in higher elos its just less often or severe.

hmboevp,PaulTheIII,11/27/2021,1,12.0,lol you can delay them feeding before you get enough of a dragon/baron lead to close out the game. Dragon spawns every 5 minutes. Everytime it does they can trade it for a turret. They would have already done that in the past and now they are getting rewarded extra for no reason imo  It’s better for the ahead team to get dragon instead of deny them the objective gold but the objective gold shouldn’t exist since *the better play* is to ignore that the enemy team is getting it. Dumb in terms of gameplay design since it’s giving ppl gold with no outplay or out macro. You can put effort in to get a pick on the person with a bounty this is just giving it to you for free

hmbknt5,VulpesLingua,11/27/2021,1,,What if the system took into account then things like that as well? If it could register that the Hypercarry on the losing team is ahead  maybe dont kick in? Much in the same way that for example if even on turrets and dragons but a teams support has the kills (for whatever reason) it would feel bad for bounties to go to the other team because then their carries benefit whereas our gold lead goes into a person that is not meant to carry.  Ive seen games where a Jungle Yi pops off rest of his team is bad but then they get the bounties which makes it FEEL worse. The metrics or logic they use to determine who gets bounties and WHEN has to be looked at.

Ekko Ezreal Ashe Katarina Lux Garen Yasuo Taliyah and Riven seem like the main characters of LoL.
hm9t2nv,Lucky_Yolo,11/27/2021,1,8.0,So they make new champion videos for old champions every now and then? How often does that happen?
hmbsh5o,CosmoJones07,11/27/2021,1,,To an extent but thats not like some direct linear correlation.  There ARE other factors involved.  For example Ziggs gets a ton of skins despite not being a popular enough champ to get top sales notches.  It just so happens that hes got a kit/model thats easy to make really good quality skins for and see their concepts best realized.
hmbsxzs,chaser676,11/27/2021,1,,Missed opportunity? Im scratching my head about how you walked away from the show not thinking well be seeing a lot more of noxus soon.
hmbsnyl,PlatinumEmperium,11/27/2021,1,,NONE OF THEM ARE THIS HOT
hmbsqux,00Dandy,11/27/2021,1,,The thing is LoL isnt very accessible. It might by f2p and works on most PCs but its a very complex game that can be difficult for new players to get into.   According to [this site](https://leaguefeed.net/did-you-know-total-league-of-legends-player-count-updated/) it has around 120 million active monthly players and Riot recently even reported 180 million active monthly players across all Runeterra games but the vast majority of those are in LoL. Minecraft has more players but its also available on almost every platform.   My point is how can a game with 120 million active players not be good?
hmbs6jz,Efficient-Law-7678,11/27/2021,1,,I wasnt speaking about these champions in particular. I was disagreeing with you that ban rate doesnt mean anything. There are champions like caitlyn that have rose to +50% ban rate which indicates a big problem.  To say it doesnt mean anything is actually stupid.

hmbaswx,BahLo-,11/27/2021,1,411.0,Stop saying I need to mature because I dont blindly accept someone abandoning his team and screwing his 4 teammates/coaches/management out of what they worked all year for. be a man and at least let your team know. its as simple as that. and guess what his own ex-teammates think the same so its not like Im alone with this lmfao.

hmbkmsf,TheBestCCIsDeath,11/27/2021,1,171.0,Im not sure because on one hand yeah people getting back after killed is annoying but o the other were talking about a team whose soul didnt affect the combat itself before their deaths so their advantage simply comes after dying instead of before.
hmatbiz,CreepyMosquitoEater,11/27/2021,1,170.0,Nah you just havent seen it to optimal potential then. You get your q cooldown so low its impossible to trade with him in lane and his early all in is crazy. Also the fact that you can rush AD instead of berserkers is so strong

hma645j,Querccias,11/27/2021,1,41.0,Youre right. But why are you on the other side of the world while your team entire team is mid trying to siege with Baron at 45 minutes.
hm8wnp8,Zylionx,11/27/2021,1,9.0,What’s the problem? Kayn is 2 Levels up with 111 Armor and tabi and like 2k gold more in item value. When is it suppose to be ever close?
hmb9qkp,neverspeakofme,11/27/2021,1,125.0,I think the statistic here is not sufficient to conclude the point you are making.  The stat might be high because the team with soul is USUALLY also ahead in gold in other words the type of soul is not the reason for the high win %.  Look at it this way. Hypothetically the team which is in a position to get 4 drakes may already have a 75% chance of winning if they choose not to take the drake. Taking any soul raises it to 86% so 10%+ higher. But taking chemtech raises it to 91% so 15% higher. Chemtech soul increases winrate by 50% more.  To look at it another way the losing team has 50% higher chance to come back if the soul was anything other than a chemtech soul.
hmale3r,Tehamilton1,11/27/2021,1,476.0,Jinx can get it
hma5utk,YoungAnimater35,11/27/2021,1,7.0,Yeah I get that but Im specifically asking how to deal with being ahead and dealing with a split pusher champ. If I leave lane they take towers when I go help my team  Just looking for different paths I could take

hm9okhv,WeirdChamp960,11/27/2021,1,21.0,Wrong. Just undeniably wrong. I play Fiora a lot and often times dont participate in fights at all. I drag 2 people to my lane absorb pressure and while they take wave I farm their jgl and pressure the next lane. There are games where I hardly fight but still absorb a shit ton of pressure.   And dont tell me its not a viable strategy. I played it up to Plat 2 with a very decent winrate.

hm9q548,iMPoSToRRBiSCuiT,11/27/2021,1,44.0,From you saying exactly I dont think youre understanding what the other commenter is saying. If the app works the way the other commenter mentioned (Im not familiar with it) it would absolutely be possible to get snow and sand from just Freljord and Shurima with no additional input if the AI simply does an internet search for related terms. From official Riot stories alone I imagine there are plenty of occurrences of the words snow and sand with Freljord and Shurima respectively

hmamwqe,MoonDawg2,11/27/2021,1,140.0,Were still the worst class with the worst representation in challenger despite being one of the most popular. Items for adc themselves is decent not too bad but nothing too good either. Weve been hard forced to go crit 90% of the time when crit is now kinda shit and the band-aid fix we got was collector which is also shit but still better than a seal item second for pretty much every crit adc minus jinx.  Honestly the issue is the 2 item spikes. It just fucking sucks regardless of what adc youre playing and the 2-3 item spikes are the most important in the game. The situational itemisation is realistcally the choice of going GA 4th or LDR 4th. I dont think Ive deviated from that almost the entire season because there is realistically nothing else to build. Wtf situational itemisation are you even talking about really?  Also the issue on LDR is that you end up lacking damage on squishies while not doing much better against tanks. Rolling a crit on a squishy with infinity is just too important on teamfights since good adc players will fish for damage on the backline and a small ldr crit doesnt really do much. It is actually a pretty meh item in practice unless massively ahead or ONLY focusing a tank theres a reason builds with ldr third or second have lower winrates.  Items themselves are fine-ish but when compared to shit like steraks lethality the new mage/tank items or gore drinker theyre underwhelming to say the least. The issue is that they cant be changed or buffed because of cancer bruisers abusing them and the only hope I had for this season was some changes for runes but again its underwhelming to say the least. Lethal is meta defining atm but the adc that can actually abuse it when compared to other roles is minute.

hma2siq,PacificCod,11/27/2021,1,29.0,He got paid 2.8 million. Its his job as a professional to do his best and not have a negative mindset. You dont see Faker go ah my teammates suck Ill just try to focus on myself and solo carry then and refuse to talk to my teammates.  If you get paid 2.8 million its your job to play league and not play PUBG to the point where FPX has to cut off your internet.  If you get paid 2.8 million its your job to learn skills (like a new language) that helps you communicate with your teammates in-game and outside of the game.  Rookie Doinb Scout Viper all dont have the same problem with communication. Vipers Chinese is really good if you listen to EDGs MicChecks. They all understand their job as a professional goes beyond just playing the game by yourself. They all understand that being able to communicate makes a real difference in the success of a team-based game. Whether its being able to communicate in-game issues or draft issues or style of gameplay issues.  This is on Nuguri for not having a professional mindset.

hmafevf,LeglessLegolas_,11/27/2021,1,376.0,> why the fuck would the crewmates also need to know?  To prevent EXACTLY the shit show we are seeing now? If it was a legitimate reason and he shared it with his teammates then it somehow leaked the entire community would be supporting Upset and shitting on the leaker. The fact that hes hiding behind privacy BS to keep the reason from his own teammates makes it very clear that he didnt feel he could justify it to his teammates. Bwipo and Adam clearly arent buying the family emergency thing. While it may have been a family emergency for Upset he clearly knew that not everyone on the team would agree with that description. Hence why he is being so secretive bordering on paranoia. No one was in the hospital or he would have told them my Dad is in the hospital. No one died or he would have told them I have to attend a funeral. Either of those explanations would have been perfectly understandable. But hes hiding behind the vagueness of family emergency for no good reason. His teammates deserve more than that and thats exactly what DL is saying here.

And every game I won was mostly just pure luck and being carried.  For me I just had to stop playing ranked because it was impossible to be in the right mental. I just went into norms and played random champions I thought would be fun. I would just play random champs and just sort of dick around until I actually wanted to win again.  After that I went back to ranked once I had my drive back. It kind of sucked to not be able to play ranked but after a while it went away and I started winning again.

hmb909j,LesserManatee08,11/27/2021,1,125.0,The reason Aatroxs revive was removed was because it provided too much safety when you were being dove by people and then it was also way too strong when diving the enemy and you were guaranteed a revive.  It was a similar case with Panths E shield blocking turret shots it warped his gameplay so much that he was incredibly good at tower diving.

hmayiqo,Nyte_Crawler,11/27/2021,1,95.0,Watching the games? I dont think that its a secret that GG had the lowest viewership in 2018. Even now you get plenty of people in discussion threads who are responding to the scoreboard or were multitasking and not really paying attention.

hmabyd6,LazerFruit,11/27/2021,1,30.0,Danny was playing support style adc it was kind of just team/macro diff. Breezy was better than zeyzal though imo
hma3fc5,SaulJoker,11/27/2021,1,,The thing is you’re only looking at the numbers for the stat and not the passive or active effects of items the abilities of the champions and how they interact with the items or even something as simple as Liandry’s mythic passive giving ability haste.  Please stop tunneling on the stat itself and look at the applications of the items you’re proposing these champions build.  EDIT: Just to make my point even clearer.  Vlad being able to build the old liandry was fine because the game was balanced to account for that.  Vlad being able to build the new liandry is not fine because the game is not balanced to account for that.
hm9kcg0,rosmarino1,11/27/2021,1,6.0,if you have fun and relax with it why stop? If you start looking at everything you do as something that must be productive youll get burnt out I think you should keep playing and focus on having fun in your free time off work!

hmafrkm,Roojercurryninja,11/27/2021,1,376.0,people are different  some cope by playing / working others need to do something for the people involved  also i dont want to misrepresent so correct me if im wrong but i remember that DL wasnt exactly particulary close to a good part of his family and he had alot of friction between him and like his mother for the choice he made  maybe DL at the time it happened thought that it was too late and he couldnt change anything even if he went back so he continued playing  it is highly likely that upsets situation was different and if upset believes that him going back could make it better compared to him not doing that then i dont really see why 2 completely different situations should be compared as see DL didnt stop playing so why did upset  especially considering we literally dont know anything about what actually happened with upsets family  so i just think its a bit weird to make that comparison

hm97ov1,PhillyFansAre2Ply,11/27/2021,1,,I played collegiate in 2013-2015 and I know that feeling youre describing so well our team was doing some ranked 5s and chill one night when we queue into LMQ like the week they landed in NA and man it was humbling. We had actually played ranked 5s against CLG on stream earlier that year and it was chill (they were off roling) and a back and forth game. But LMQ sweated us so hard like it was a scrim and just completely dismantled us. I knew right then that I could never go pro haha the gulf was massive.
hmbfo4c,Rooneynani9321,11/27/2021,1,214.0,The winter map was one of my fondest memories of this game as a kid hard to believe they just stopped doing it.
hmad14o,Lvl100Karp,11/27/2021,1,310.0,Upset should have his privacy and not need to tell the public but not telling your teammates the ones youve been working with competing with training with for 60+ hours a week is stupid.   There is absolutely 0 reason to not tell his teammates why he cannot attend the biggest reason why theyre playing the game. I cant see anything that happened be serious enough to not tell your team. Fuck telling the public but the team?   The only reason I see that he isnt telling them is that the reason isnt serious enough so he feels stupid. Then again I could be wrong I know absolutely nothing of his life except that he treated his team like shit.

Other than that just going in and out with autos is better most of the time.  Jhin is likely the easiest adc atm you just need a few ground rules like any other.

hmbj3mu,Ruesap,11/27/2021,1,210.0,Teams wont be paying their full salary on benched players. You think they dont have the confidence in themselves to think they wont get benched? Yeah right. Everyone takes a risk including the team not just the player and the upsides are better than your garbage. You think rekkles isnt getting bank because hes playing in France who have some of the most spending fans of all of EU? They foot the bill not even compatible to the other two which are still on their payroll regardless and have confidence in their skills. They will keep doing it and you will keep wondering why people do it while crying as if there was no benefits to it. I told you some of the benefits to it risks are things every party takes and doesnt denounce the benefits they see in this and why it keeps happening. The biggest risk is getting paid to do nothing I dont think they care about your argument.

hma0428,Just4TehLulz,11/27/2021,1,53.0,Yeah this dude doesnt play ADC. LT on basically every ADC is okay at best and actually feels bad on champs like Vayne because of the constantly changing AS which fucks with kiting and you end up auto cancelling.

Animation so detailed and high quality with so many constantly moving parts as this first season will take a long time regardless of how many people you have working on it.  Like its one thing if its just a randomly put together collection of different animation sequences but a show has to be cohesive so the scenes have to pass through multiple workers constantly.

hm9ic1z,Prestonwww,11/27/2021,1,32.0,I can definitely understand where youre coming from being loyal to a series. I was born in 02 so I was a little late for the originals of almost every game. But Im an avid pokemon fan and man did I play the shit out of my heartgold and soulsilver copies. I loved those games like they were my children. From that point on Ive loved pokemon ever since but with the recent release of brilliant diamond and shining pearl Im pretty unimpressed. I will not spend that much money for a chibi remake. No thank you. And legends arceus looks pretty cool just not quite my style for a pokemon game. Im glad that they are trying new things I just prefer the whole gym battles and elite four things personally.

hmaji6d,XiaoRCT,11/27/2021,1,375.0,You are literally writing a fanfic about Faker. Faker isnt stupid you dedicate yourself for something in a team and someone on your team fails youll want to know the reason and no vague explanations like family emergency will not be enough. Obviously this whole thing shouldnt have gone public but Upset shouldnt have been so vague about the issue with his team either.   Hily did without much drama because hes much closer to Upset than the other 3.

hmaq9kr,lumni,11/27/2021,1,11.0,Its a very solid (second) item on KhaZix depending on the game.   If the team is relying on you to be the flanking assassin and the other team is gunning for you as you are ahead then you can do this:  Go duskblade CDR boots and then pick up axiom arc.  You can go evolve R as the second evolve and with the CDR + this item youre basically just invisible all the time. It gives you unparalleled flanking power and mobility to go in and out of fights.   You will have up your R twice in teamfights unless its a wombo-combo fest but then you shouldnt be going this item and will be playing KhaZix in a different way anyways.  Its not broken or anything but depending on the game it can be very good. Also KhaZix is more of a solid jungler than Nocturne is. So that helps as well -)

hmbaf9r,HaakonRDT,11/27/2021,1,1547.0,He is legit to ask for answers but he should NEVER get them. Upsets private situation is his private situation fnatic has no right to reveal that stuff for anybody else. Its a teammate its a janitor or Arnold fckng Schwazenegger - they all are equally randoms.  And even if they did tell him what the F does it change? Does it get easier to upset? Do they get to play worlds differently? No. So F that approach that he should know something.  Especially now no one should EVER tell him shit if he is so trigger happy to post twitlongers about anything that is going on involving any of his teammates. None of his future colleagues should ever reveal him any private stuff.  He wasnt told gf felt bad he was told it is serious family emergency Upset said it look at Yamato video about the situation nowhere it is Fing addressed as gf felt bad what is it middleschool? Adam came to these conclusions of his own (as he explicitly states in his twitlonger) because nobody gave him answers that he is not entitled to.  Somehow not knowing anything more is good for 8 year veteran Hyllisang who is happy to keep playing with upset but not for 19 year old barbie.  But Adam is Young and stupid he can learn and grow out of this shit might have a bright future.  Bwipos case is inexcusable. He basically threw his whole team under the bus to make some kind of apology/endorsement statement. Implying none of his teammates or his coach could do anything to get environment better other than his super duper GF.  F that shit good player too bad he left his brains in someone elses vagina.  Regarding his replacement talks everything was done appropriately. No one has to tell anyone shit. He can go and be mad but it is not in my interest to tell him anything and I wont. Humanoid decided to leave on his own way before the anouncement.  Unless You think that in some kind of Fd up world Mad Lions or any other org would actually replace the #1 current midlaner in LEC with a fckng random rookie? :D   Noone gives a F about how well reeker played in inferior league when Humanoid is dominating LEC. Mad had no choice.

hm9kgdy,lawfulkitten1,11/27/2021,1,31.0,There are people who get paid millions of dollars (/ pounds / your preferred currency) a year to play sports who still know when its the right time to give up. Think about teams in team sports (basketball football etc.) who pull their starters with time still left on the board and a theoretical 0.0000001% chance that you could still win the game. Now compare that to the average league player who is probably studying and/or has a job and certainly isnt getting paid millions of dollars to play solo queue games.... can you really blame them for surrendering at 15 minutes rather than dragging out that game to 30+ minutes just on the <1% chance enemy team makes a huge throw from an unloseable postion?

hmag1ec,Random_Stealth_Ward,11/27/2021,1,,> I agree with how stupidly easy itd make the Vanguards apply it. Though ADCs can also apply it very easily (3 aas with Mortal Reminder ?).  Yeah but consider it like this: mortal reminder only applies the 60% if you hit them with the three autos. This means the first two autos arent going to have the 60% GW applied and you actually apply the effect on a lower area of effect when it does triggers.   > Then how about just keeping the first condition of 40% and adding a 50% max HP threshold like Morello or Chempunk instead of the CC condition.  If it replaced the cc condition it would likely be a nerf to tanks as it would go back to only applying if you are getting attacked Which would give you less control of how to apply it and its not like tanks are really capable of getting a ton of Champions to 50% HP maybe even probably a nerf to bruisers too. Its basically a well if a ton of jueggernauts cant apply lets make tons of other champs not apply it situation. If it was just added as a bonus it potentially could be too strong but i am not too sure... It probably would be fine  I wouldnt be surprised if the 60% against half HP enemies was actually used in the first iterations before new thorn came but An important factor to consider about thornmail is that its basically the lowest interaction GW. Making the 60% GW tied to the user being active with it (inmobilizing an enemy) rather than passive is probably the way to give it more interaction and some better control in how to apply it when dealing with enemies that dont autoattack as much.
hmayv0p,JedstarRomero17,11/27/2021,1,30.0,On almost all adc Lux just has to press E on top of you and you literally dont have the move speed to get out of its radius.   Adcs dont get to choose to push the wave or not your support decides how laning goes.   The making her push the lane is the only good point in your comment.

hmbepc8,_ziyou_,11/27/2021,1,303.0,The fix would be so easy (i.e. reduce %AS for melee) but I suppose Riot wants to see how it plays out for a bit longer.
hmbk2zq,pseudolemons,11/27/2021,1,303.0,Or you know most people dont change their runes dramatically on their good champions or adapt well to a new playstyle and those who are trying it because its supposedly good are not experienced enough so for instance if their pick rate increased tremendously and theyre 52% wr thats way more telling than a very small stable playrate champion having a 52% wr.   This is the problem with statistics you have to use your brain a lot not to take wrong conclusions with it.   Funnily enough this is also why scientific discoveries can be very debatable even though theyre supposedly dealing with facts. Theres nothing fun about this nvm.

He claims upset left because his wife was lonely and then writes himself that he doesnt knows anything and just trows wrong claims online on social media. He wrote that upset tried to replace him and nisqy in a top 10 anime betrayal fashion on social media. But infact it was alphari + fnatic that approached upset and asked about his opinion about alphari. Iam in Germany you can report my post if you want. Dunno how it is for others not from Germany but we get if we press the report button a direct choice to report the post if its against that law. Even here on reddit :D

hmakldu,MoonDawg2,11/27/2021,1,115.0,Its not big for exception of a few adc  You need some natural steroids to make lethal worth it or just be extremely ahead. If you have either of the two its actually really strong but apart from that its pretty shit. Cait for example is extremely underwhelming with it because of lacking a steroid but jinx for example is extremely strong with it because of q atk speed or the bonus 10% dmg and once its stacked she massively abuses her own passive.     Just a badly made rune tbh.

hmbf9pd,Gerblinoe,11/27/2021,1,,You are getting awfully riled up when its basically 2 people speculating about some esport drama with no info    You arent alone in your feelings absolutely but I dont see what that has to do with anything?   And while Upsets teammates are angry as they have any right to be people like Yamato said that Upset was absolutely justified in leaving and Hyli who got more info than any other player isnt dropping any angry twitlongers   And again I cant say if he should have told them because first of all I dont know what happened and I dont know any of these people and neither do you.  I also dont see where Im blindly supporting Upset or anybody    I just said I cant judge shit because I dont know shit like everybody else in this subreddit    And that arguments like well he played arams so clearly nothing happened are bs simply because it doesnt prove shit because thats how people work.  I also said that if he left for example because his wife miscarried thats a valid reason which I will stand by because thats like basic human decency.   I guess you think that if I dont curse out Upset I blindly support him which seems weirdly combative but you do you.   To reitarate again I dont think you or me or anybody on this subreddit has enough knowledge about this situation or people involved to give any sort of solid who was in the wrong judgement

hmbag50,VeritasCicero,11/27/2021,1,196.0,Thats because hextech and chemtech isnt naturally occurring. Its developed. Tech that uses magic as its power source = hextech. Combining magic and chemical compunds = chemtech.  Its an advanced application of magic. I dunno why youre so stuck on it being foundational when it was never deemed as such. Theres no naturally occuring tech trees that you can cut the tech branches off to make the tech plating for your hextech revolver. Just not how it works.
hmb67fu,Virata,11/27/2021,1,41.0,Very impressive you should be proud of this attempt for sure
hmb7xmc,Temeritas,11/27/2021,1,452.0,That is way too generalized and technically not correct. A VPN works by tunneling your traffic up to an exit point towards your destination. However the route the tunneled traffic takes can be very different than the route used for the normal traffic. That means it might need more or fewer hops thus it can have a higher or lower ping.   It is very unlikely that you will get a lower ping with a free VPN as those doubtfully have optimized routing or enough computational power for speedy decryption/encryption of your traffic at their endpoint. But depending on how bad your routing is a paid for VPN might very well provide you with a lower ping.

Since then I’ve usually muted voice chat in all games I’ve played and seriously your enjoyment Increased tenfold when you don’t even have to read your toxic teammates abuse
hm93smh,KnockoutRoundabout,11/27/2021,1,7741.0,People in this thread deadass have never been responsible for young kids lmao.  Powder did REALLY stupid shit that had dire consequences but all of it makes sense as long as you keep in mind that she is a young traumatized child whos desperation to be seen as useful and able to contribute skewed whatever child rationality she had.  Also she basically had little bombs. You give ANY kid bombs and things are likely to go bad if they are smart enough to know how to activate them.  Of COURSE her decisions and behavior are gonna be weird as hell when you look at it from the perspective of an adult. But imo Powders behavior from start to finish was all completely in-line with how they had built up her character as well as how most traumatized kids would act (though uh with less fantastical scenarios).  You dont have to like her obviously but saying she was out of character or what happened makes no sense is just nonsense.

hm9ywwm,That_Leetri_Guy,11/27/2021,1,431.0,Actually names wont be an issue due to how Riot ID works. You can have the same summoner name as someone else as long as you have a different tag. For instance you could have BoostedApe #EUW1 and BoostedApe #EUW2 on the same server without issues and both would only show up as BoostedApe in-game.  Eventually the summoner name will be completely replaced with the Riot ID (was supposed to be this year but Covid) which makes it much easier to get the name you want.
hm9uiml,Alex_Wizard,11/27/2021,1,19.0,The bounty system has increased game times across the board. Because the average game time is longer late game champions indirectly got a major buff. Pair that with things like First Strike injecting a lot of early gold or Lethal Tempo ramping up carries earlier in the game and you get things like Viktor coming online when he completes crown and then taking over if the enemy team makes one mistake and gives him a bounty objective.   Either the bounty system needs to be refined more or every late game champ is going to have to get adjusted to compensate for the new game times.

If you play with friends anyways there is no need to type with randoms. If you want to communicate with them use pings. If s1 spam pings mute him/her as well. It helps you improve faster too. I was stuck in low plat cuz I argued got distracted or tilt cuz of randoms. Since I mute all I am able to focus more on the game and was able to reach high dia cuz of that ^^

The new one is only better in lane for her (since you only lose around 10~20% AS early on and its easier to stack in lane where stuff isnt one shotting you yet) and not that much better even.

hm9baot,TheNephilims,11/27/2021,1,155.0,What I mean is maybe at some point in production Riot could have negotiated a deal with netflix that they will produce this show and it will be streamed exclusively on Netflix or after they produced it they bring it to Netflix and sold them licensing right to stream it. Either way Riot got money from Netflix.  Given the success of the show on Netflix I can see season 2 being stream exclusively on Netflix again.

When I went through some shit I played arams until I feel asleep at my computer because it let me forget that some really bad shit was going on. People respond to trauma differently you’re actually fucked if you’re trying to crucify a guy for trying to find an escape from what could have been a really bad situation for him.
hmaxuos,MoonDawg2,11/27/2021,1,170.0,> Galeforce is perfectly fineits just slightly more situational in comparison to Kraken  I cant really think of any reason to use galeforce over kraken unless youre Lucian or Jhin. Maybe forgetting some irrelevant adc somewhere. Think twitch can use it?  > Literally any semi on hit based ADC can viable use iteven if theres not a gigantic AP threat in the enemy team  Yeah apart from on-hit adc its usually a bad item. That being said I think its honestly fine to have an item like that.  > It works fine on a plethora of ADCs like ApheliosKalista and Dravenbut is simply more situational in the same vein as Galeforce   Forgot aphelios and kalista actually. One I just dont play and the other is a bit irrelevant currently. Draven is perma-banned on masters+ where I usually play so honestly forgot about him too.  The tldr on shieldbow is that its actually shit unless you have some ridiculous damage on abilities. Its an aggro item not defensive which is a bit stupid.  > The item is quite literally one of the strongest second items in terms of damage and has an insane scaling to boot.  And it still has a lower winrate on every slot except for 4th or 5th. Really the item heavily suffers from buildpath and once finished it needs more items to scale correctly

hma9hob,Excellentation,11/27/2021,1,15.0,lmao bro you had me at the title alone with decent botlane synergy kogmaw can bully most ADCs with the new lethal tempo and his W and he scales super hard
hm9j41a,uvPooF,11/27/2021,1,389.0,It definitely is the most common language that everyone speaks. What do you think that players of different nationalities on EUNE just speak polish or russian with each other?
hma683t,JoaoMau-Tempo,11/27/2021,1,145.0,Not only that but we arent claiming that Doublelifts word is gospel it simply has a different weight on this situation when compared to random redditors who have never even played pro.
hm92oca,anqilador999,11/27/2021,1,29.0,I hope Riot fixes all the bugs next patch or at least before the ranked seasson starts

hm8uur0,bearugh,11/27/2021,1,18.0,Believe me I feel you but like when your playing week side theres alot you can do to make those opportunities not exist.   Id your getting ganked force them to tower dive and make a risk freeze the wave on your side fake agencie over your lane and situation.
hmbc8p5,homer12346,11/27/2021,1,9.0,while noxus are conquerors they are also inclusive as long as you can back yourself up with some way to serve the empire either fighting on the frontlines or working on weapon/armor production or important intel etc  they are grey
hm9l1ov,eddieciotek2,11/27/2021,1,71.0,yea :(
hmagdjh,Fictitious1267,11/27/2021,1,29.0,First scuttle got nerfed so needing to stay in lane is less punished. And the new items give him some good build variety and more power. Games tend to stall out more now unless they end super early. Yeah I think hes good.
hm8y9eo,BBQMasterDad,11/27/2021,1,13.0,And to that I reply with why didn’t you see a tp opportunity? If you’re 2/0 and forcing your laner out why are you not holding tp priority for your botlane?

hmaehzt,Exclarius,11/27/2021,1,,> All this just points to an inability on Upsets part to view himself as anything other than a victim.  Imagine the victim of harassment feeling as a victim of harassment. What an idea.  > Mate if he is still all this time later so utterly distraught that he cant even think straight enough to send a DM to his fucking teammate....  He told his direct management what was going on. His management knows about it and informs his teammates. There is not a single issue here. It is up to Upset to decide who he wants to go in to details about his situation to. Seeing how Adam handled this Im not surprised that Upset didnt tell him every explicit detail.  It is really not a weird concept to not want to broadcast private issues to the world. If I am going through something Ill explain it to my teamlead but I am under no obligation to explain my life story to my direct colleagues. Of course if I want to I can do this but it is not a must.
hmb4n4x,LoLrovex,11/27/2021,1,341.0,I think the misunderstanding is that I am speaking from my experience for when I started the challenge. I found every role easier to carry with but support was the hardest to carry games with. If I were to do this to challenger I would say support is the easiest to get to from where the accounts are now.

hm9l54d,wes_T_ward,11/27/2021,1,7.0,There are some game strategies where like you wont get kills or assists that are legitimate ie proxy singed. Like KDA doesnt wholly reflect wether your trolling like if you drag their whole team to chase you and waste their time then that gives your own team a better gold and exp lead and turns fights from 5x5 to like 4 v 3 or 4 v 2.
hmbh8gs,xHansi,11/27/2021,1,18.0,Yeah thought so. Unfortunate
hman2kl,TheOneAtomsk,11/27/2021,1,25.0,New to the game not because of Arcane though. How do yall handle all this item info like holy cow.

hmbcsuz,thefrostman1214,11/27/2021,1,9.0,its not since years and years
hm9uyau,TymurXoXo,11/27/2021,1,31.0,Here’s a hot take: they don’t.  If the game is really lost by 15 minutes than it won’t last much longer so conceding doesn’t really matter.  What’s more common is the early lead being pushed for 5 minutes and the game being lost by the 20 minutes mark. At this point… the feeding teammate doesn’t have a vote? You only need 4 people to agree on conceding so if all the other people agree you will FF anyway.  Or is your point about if 1 teammate feeds you should be able to concede with a 4 man vote and 3/4 yes? So that if two people are behind in game a toxic premade can just ff ruining the game for other 8 people??   Like what’s your point?? If the game is lost one person will never be able to hold you in game and if you have two feeding teammates then the game will not last long anyway?
hma0v3h,CreepyMosquitoEater,11/27/2021,1,327.0,Go look at Emirus on TikTok. She had the tattoos and contacts and everything.
hmaatwc,ikingjosh,11/27/2021,1,12395.0,I forgot about the exchange between Jinx and Silco after hes shot.  That does explain it a little better.  Whats frustrating is I can no longer sympathize with both Vi and Jinx re the breaking of the relationship.  Either its Jinxs fault  jumping to conclusions about how Vi feels about her now (Vi seemed totally sincere at the dinner table) and choosing this  alternative narrative in her head.  Or its Vis fault:  Her urgency to be with Jinx after getting out of jail seemed inadequate to me and the way the bridge scene ended seemed like she was writing off Jinx walking away from her with Caitlyn.  Also the punch at the end of act 1 seemed totally overdone even for what Powder did.  Its like theyre both unlikable now
hm97h64,Pixtart,11/27/2021,1,,He used stats to back his statements which are useful things to use. What do you use? Snarky comments and bullshit reasons why youre the one who isnt wrong. We might all be braindead as you say but I guarentee that you over estimate the value you provide to any real discussions in your life. Head so far up your own ass you live off your own farts.
hmanqll,PokeD2,11/27/2021,1,476.0,Probs cuz she used that one in her normal Jinx cosplay
hm9yjqb,KnitCat99,11/27/2021,1,178.0,3 years of giving up on international success*

hma92xm,frumfram,11/27/2021,1,,How much more specific can he be without actually revealing what happened  This is something we probably never know he may have already told as much as he could without violating privacy of his close ones
hma9cqm,WmWzK,11/27/2021,1,21.0,Bug the e extends in duration or his body goes on the edge if he somehow casts it
hmamhr2,WelcomeToTrollTown,11/27/2021,1,85.0,To be fair it passively increases bonus armor and MR by 25% which tanks tend to build more of.

hmbnhgp,Zp00nZ,11/27/2021,1,156.0,They’re also some of the strongest magic items currently in the world. They destroyed the world once almost voiding the world of life.  Basically ryze is kinda like the magic Batman of league with some prep time he can use the runes to beat anyone.
hm9htm8,titorr03,11/27/2021,1,389.0,Euw has 4 million ranked players and eune has 2. So its more like 50%

hma92iu,FrequentlyBottomFrag,11/27/2021,1,52.0,Nice arm chair analysis what a fcken psycho. Bruh you dont know if he did that purposefully or not. He was always quiet even in damwon which is why in the beginning of the team him n canyon couldnt play together because neither of them talked. He gave it his best if he was just chilling he wouldnt have taken this year off. Lck players cant afford to take a year off with the military service hanging above their heads
hm9ey42,Mixed_not_swirled,11/27/2021,1,188.0,No i base my opinion on my own 6 years maining this champ in plat and diamond elo and the opinions of Singed players who are orders of magnitude better than either of us at this game.

hma4nh0,Applepowdersnow,11/27/2021,1,6.0,it reveals stealthed units but not invisible units afaik. so this should be normal
hmauchx,e_zzzz,11/27/2021,1,19.0,Still strong and annoying to play against esp with top and jg bruiser meta. They have been playing inhouses non-public during the off season so they know what’s op or not. Jinx is another strong late game carry. Graves Irelia tf Camille are also broken picks. Enchanters are also in general valuable in most comps. Vex if you can play her but not many pros have practiced her since she wasn’t playable for last season in pro and it’s only pre season
hm9y33u,kapparino-feederino,11/27/2021,1,12.0,any info on when will we be getting the episode 4?
hma38vo,Karnadas,11/27/2021,1,,Being mirrored doesnt change that her lips dont match the words. Otherwise lip syncing in the mirror would be off too.

hm9bdr3,zverkan69,11/27/2021,1,51.0,Yeah its her for sure I somehow still remember her from back in the day I think she used to be most known for her arcade riven cosplay and yes she was some of the best cosplayers/cosmakers I saw on this sub

hmbgv9e,ApplePitou,11/27/2021,1,5.0,This has been a problem for a long time because this game evokes negative emotions in many people and often people like that just become toxic :3
hm9qit8,BLUELAMBORGHINI64,11/27/2021,1,43.0,if they handled it like arcane with acts act1 could be a retelling of him and yone act 2 would be the present where he meets taliyah and the act3 ends with taliyah leaving for shruima and him meeting riven
hm9afu8,DHSUAUGEV,11/27/2021,1,2.0,Yes that kat tried to hold still and auto a Warwick to death.
hmasqrj,kazuyaminegishi,11/27/2021,1,113.0,Yeah the reddit community is just as fickle as the cn community. I still remember the LMQ situation where opinion was just who spoke last? Yeah theyre right and the other party should be hung from the gallows.  Even the current Upset situation is fickleness. Ive seen comments going well 3 people agree vs 1 person who disagrees so the 3 must be right. Its just a league community thing likely due to how massive the fan base is. Theres bound to be quite a few fickle people among the reasonable people.
hm961e6,matt260204,11/27/2021,1,26.0,Your flairs are literally qiyana and talon. I can tell why you wouldnt see anything but kills as a good measure of if you deserve to win.  I would change what you said to if you are 15/0 losing just shows that you arent doing anything mid-late game.  Getting fed early game means nothing if you are useless the last 20 minutes of the game.
hmay5yz,deedshotr,11/27/2021,1,95.0,have you stopped to consider that there was probably a reason for those Reddit narratives? how do you know that he wasnt just shit
hmb8d7l,unclecaramel,11/27/2021,1,83.0,Honestly I would like if they redid the SoL event through riot forge or make ruined king 2

hm9li8y,floodyberry,11/27/2021,1,21.0,good to see NA finally taking things seriously. This is def the year they turn it around
hmamkyz,Nyte_Crawler,11/27/2021,1,90.0,Reddit narratives killed Matts career sadly. Matt was probably a top 3 support in 2018 (granted this was before CoreJJ and Vulcan were LCS)  but that roster was pretty trash and he got dumped for Olleh since Reddit narrative said obviously Matt and Lourlo were the biggest problems so the org obliged wanting to save face after back to back 10th place finishes.  At the least Matt was the strongest support in lane in 2018 was consistently winning lane with Deftly everyones favorite KDA player. Knowing that he was a guy who always struggled with haters Im not surprised that him getting pushed to academy pretty much killed the momentum he built in 2018.
hmbh6sk,KaynsSlave,11/27/2021,1,5.0,Yup. Its ranked system doesnt make sense. I guess theyre doing it on purpose pbe is just for fun
hm961vu,5ait5,11/27/2021,1,28.0,not like spica and blaber arent comparable players to  him. Doublelift might be a bit washed in comparison though
hma8rz1,Meloce,11/27/2021,1,314.0,I’m leaning towards it had to be some form of suicide/ self harm situation. That would make Upset entirely a stand up guy for leaving. No matter the communities perception of his wife he has a commitment to her.
hmaa9i2,SgtBananaKing,11/27/2021,1,408.0,6/10
hmb99ab,sothito,11/27/2021,1,549.0,Keep thots out of the fandom
hm8xdco,infinityoncorktree,11/27/2021,1,12.0,More than that I feel like its because hes CoreJJ. Good players probably want to play with him. Two of the teams are captained by junglers so naturally Core is going to get the academy jungler with pretty much the most LCS time.
hm9m3qa,Hudre,11/27/2021,1,196.0,Im sure op would have mentioned it.

hma7q5a,Ze_Ike,11/27/2021,1,7.0,The problem comes when team A gets soul but is weaker in teamfights than team B team B then proceeds to win the teamfight while team A revives and kills team B right back. The end result is neither team accomplishing anything on the map and the game stalling out even longer
hmb5x81,IHateReddit_9001,11/27/2021,1,626.0,A player who is placed on the appropriate place in the mmr rating will have in the long run 50% win rate. Except at literally the very top of the ladder winrate doesn’t tell you in absolute terms how good or bad someone is just how appropriate their current mmr is. If your teammates are also diamond and 50% winrate then they’re a perfectly appropriate match to make to your mmr.

hma29o2,Party-47,11/27/2021,1,126.0,>I believe the damage of her ult goes off right as her untargetability ends so she does reset tower aggro momentarily but then gets it again due to her ult damage going off on the champ.  Wait that also means that if someone damages the enemy champion during her ult cast it is fine? So against something with a lot of Dots (lets say Liandrys Zyra with multiple plants out) she should get the toweraggro reset at least sometimes.  Interesting.
hmafx8j,SaulJoker,11/27/2021,1,79.0,Seems like it. Shame I really enjoyed the EDG episode.
hmbqpe1,Araeza,11/27/2021,1,156.0,This. The world is made up of hundreds of different stories and historic moments just like in real life. We really could have had an Arcane sized show based around just about any group of League champs. I love Arcane but I’m a little sad about the Noxius vs Ionia missed opportunity.   Almost every single champ in the game is the main character of at least a few stories unless you’re Heimer in which case you’re doomed to watch everything unfold while everyone ignores your warnings.
hmafwe9,Delicious-Owl-3672,11/27/2021,1,195.0, 3 - 3 worlds group and doesnt get out  Quote me in this
hm9b8yr,Raynar7,11/27/2021,1,27.0,Jesus poor Tencent will soon get blamed for everything.   Anyway what you and many other people do not consider is the fact that with any skin - yes even winter skin for SR - Riot would have big trouble with champions skins and their clarity.   There are plenty of skins that are basically P2W on ARAM (winter map) because of how the map looks.  I know it’s hard to understand that but skins for champs > skins for map that most of people would turn off anyway since they are used to normal SR.
hmawu4a,HaxCalibour,11/27/2021,1,19.0,Because why would u when u have prime? U realize most people dont have prime only because of league right?
hmbazya,ralanr,11/27/2021,1,125.0,It makes tanks weaker in the beginning of fights.   And granted it doesn’t feel like much. But at a max of 20% (because I’ve seen this happen a lot. Anecdotal though) it’s annoying.
hmbeo2a,itsTheArmor,11/27/2021,1,,Yeah Im aware thats why I wondered how he got it. Im not sure if the original Thresh changed his name or something like that.  Small correction its Quake not Doom.
hmbou3t,Gragiator,11/27/2021,1,10.0,he would be straight up garbage
hmaj5e1,JedstarRomero17,11/27/2021,1,6.0,Noone actually knows how it works. MMR has been entirely hidden from the playerbase for years.   Either keep playing to improve and just reap the results at a later date or start a new account that you can likely get to Platinum in 100 games.
hma9504,DokonaLost,11/27/2021,1,314.0,finally someone speaks some sort of real life. U do not join the entertainment business if you want complete privacy. They are a unit or were supposed to be and this shows exactly how Non- team oriented some of these teams really are.  Feels like upset was pretty firm on not playing with adam the next split before worlds even began. And Idk Maybe this is a hottake but I dont see a team with Upset winning worlds in the first place :/ more to business than getting maybe one or two more wins than u did this year. Teams will be completely drained by the end of next split with all these salaries.
hmbh36c,RobbinDeBank,11/27/2021,1,,I guess you’re the annoying one here. Faker is loved universally by almost everyone that follows league esports. You see people with flairs of all different teams praising Faker. You see every pro mid laner says that their idol is Faker. But I guess you’re so superior “dUrR hUrR fAkEr bAd aNnOyInG fAn”
hmaxfnt,peachnipple,11/27/2021,1,502.0,That’s what caps are for tho?
hmadx4v,Gorakthegreat,11/27/2021,1,289.0,With how rank % have been changed this could be false now. Depending on when you heard this
hmaf6no,Lceus,11/27/2021,1,12.0,Incredible! Would love to see if you could also pull off Jinx
hmaaal1,Going2chang3,11/27/2021,1,12395.0,I said in another post. If they had made s1 with 3 more episodes detailing the resolution to this. Then made the next season an anthology story showing the world of Runeterra feeling the ripple effects of hextech and Zauns claim to freedom it wouldve been goated. But it sure feels like theyre going to focus on Z/P and I feel itll lose its punch. And its primarily because of how they pulled the ending theyve lost my trust. They clearly dont trust their own writing to give a satisfying ending and have that want to come back they have to tease what happens next!?!? To do it and that turns me off of a show so fast.
hm8y4ir,fartdiroperandus,11/27/2021,1,183.0,And this is why I play top lane and exclusively champs that can survive or turn a 1v2.  I want to push and trade and play like a donkey and I dont want the enemy jungle to ruin it. I want them to be a part of it.
hmahz3l,Bmandk,11/27/2021,1,23.0,I have literally never seen it do anything yet.
hmaecxo,Liteboyy,11/27/2021,1,79.0,That’s kinda crazy to be on a team like FPX and just decide they aren’t good enough to win worlds so you just chill in top island. Lmfao.
hmb3mrt,MoonDawg2,11/27/2021,1,206.0,> Dude you cant abuse that bug you can literally get permabanned for it and again ITS A BUG.  Dude animation cancels are bugs and so are a ton of other mechanics. Cait alone had several bug abuses through the years and no one was ever banned for it. Abuse the bug youre not going to be banned and nobody cares if you do.   Weve had config abuses for years too. Bigger minimap before that was a thing bigger resolution screens further away specific cancelations of champs (kaisa Q evolve is the best example) and other shit that you can do with the .json file.  If its not fixed then its abusable since this game is so riddled with bugs that half the time youre doing one without even realizing it.  > That said it doesnt matter whether you have Galeforce or Kraken once an AD carry has IE LDR and once a mage has Voidstaff there is no such thing as lasting more than 5 seconds.  So when juggernauts are supposed to fall off? Even then I dont think Ive seen juggernauts not at least tank they usually last a good amount of time.  Are you sure youre farming correctly? The only time Ive seen this is when the juggernaut player is behind which is completely acceptable at that point. That or vayne/kog are in the game.

hmb1y2s,EdAY_,11/27/2021,1,,His reputation went from the world champion soon to be Chinese son-in-law to Korean dog Honestly the…intensity of LPL fans and frankly toxic environment is the reason that I watch it a lot without being too invested in any one team.
hmbq38m,VeritasCicero,11/27/2021,1,225.0,The issue with your whole premise will always be the tech part. Technology by definition is not naturally occurring.   Chemicals naturally occur. Add magic and you might have chemomancy. Iron naturally occurs. Find someone to manipulate it and you have metalomancy or something.  But when you add tech you imply an act of will that mixed and developed things to a specific advanced state. That doesnt naturally occur.
hm8vojn,lilelf29,11/27/2021,1,18.0,I wouldnt say hes unknown here maybe back with the Clid or flawless/imp rosters but ever since 2020 and his insane spring this year with LPL gaining more English popularity as of late his name is much more talked about.
hm95ng3,Terozu,11/27/2021,1,98.0,I actually agree here.  There was some indications.  She probably has budding romantic feelings for Vi at this point.  But she didnt quite grab them like Vi did.

hmbrlq4,AnapleRed,11/27/2021,1,170.0,E-Q-W-Ring someone with old swain was one of the most satisfying things. I will never forgive them removing Swain from the game.
hmb5gzf,Althalus-,11/27/2021,1,165.0,You’re arguing semantics here. Riot said the chromas would come back each year for the snow events. They didn’t last year. That was my whole point. They said this in 2019 before bringing back the event and chromas. They didn’t do this in 2020 the rumour at the time was that because it didn’t sell well in China they just didn’t do it. I have no facts to back that up it was just opinion at the time.

hm91von,Raynar7,11/27/2021,1,61.0,Why? As far as I know Rookie hasn’t re-signed too so he might just be waiting for him. He stated his desire to play with Rookie multiple times.   Would say it’s Rookie first and the rest doesn’t matter.
hma9qkx,tanezuki,11/27/2021,1,77.0,Because then youll get melted by any physical percentage based damage.   Aside from Mathematically correct meme Sett build I dont see Chempunk working on him. And hes not even one of the champions who cant use Thornmail efficiently. He can apply it to the whole enemy team if he places a good ult combo.

hmaibcg,Glum_Radio,11/27/2021,1,79.0,Before i can talk about my opinion you can watch EDG version here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K\_uFU2L9Ano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_uFU2L9Ano)  Vipers case:  First You cant compare the case of Viper and Nuguri together just  because theyre Korean. Yes theyre Korean but they have different role. Viper is  an AD and  he have Meiko assists him ALL THE TIME especially EDG like to play through bot. Meiko is super friendly and like to talk ALOT talking here doesnt mean hello or hwating or winning losing but talk about everything until you open your mouth and talk to him thats Vipers first benefit in EDG. Plus Meiko already has experience with Deft.  Second Viper has Scout as roommate and translator. Although each team has their own translator and Manager but thats only for learning language in normal life player rather like to ask or communicate with their teammate because theyre the same age. Scout also a talkative friendly person like Meiko and willing to help Viper anytime.  Third Viper is extrovert person so he can quickly adapt to the new environment Flander Jeje Coach EDGs staff are all willing to communicate or even joke  with Viper again communicate here doesnt mean hello or hwating or about winning losing but talk about everything outside the game like how are you feeling right now whats your opinon?..ect. They make you comfortable enough to be able to share about your own opinion Viper even pointed out Flanders bad habit of dying too much because it makes Viper feel super insecure. Flander accepted that and didnt feel offensive at all.  Finally EDG isnt an easy-going team yes theyre talkative they like to joke (include Coach and staff) they will  scold you super harsh if youre lost but theyre still want to communicate with you and ASK ABOUT YOUR OWN FEELING rather than telling you to do this or that and ignore your feeling/opinion. Viper is lucky to join EDG and EDG is  also lucky to have Viper. This is a win win situation Viper is clearly put a lot of effort but EDG also put a lot of effort to understand their player.  In Nuguris case:  He is an introvert and has poor health from the start. He is a top laner unlike adc has their support a top laner usually play alone or require Jungle to have them but in this case Tian/Bo really cant help Nuguri at all because Doinb also require Jungle help heavily.  I can clearly see this is an awkward situation for Nuguri to feel. FPX player seem quiet beside DoinB Tian said he was trying to communicate with Nuguri but its just try to say hello or hwaiting it is nonsense conversation.  Lwx and Crisp didnt communicate much with Nuguri Tian is also a quiet person (this kid look super unhealthy lol) the only person can communicate with Nuguri is Doinb and i dont see it at all DoinB alway talk about the game and winning thats all the coach the staff i dont see any of them talking to Nuguri much so maybe this is the reason he feel so disconnect with the team i mean he look so sad and lonely.  You can see at 01:02:36 after FPX taking the group photo Nuguri just look so lost and look around because he didnt know what to do or go next and no one come to guide him. I dont defense for Nuguri here because i also think Nuguri didnt put much effort to integrate with the team but the problem here is FPX staff and player also didnt put effort to integrate with Nuguri.  Overall if you want to compare between Nuguri and Viper you better see EDG documentary first to understand the situation.

hm9pgi7,Padouch1038,11/27/2021,1,55.0,1. Dont try to fight Udyr early he is one of the best 1v1 champs in the game. 2.

In late game if your team has Seryldas you can kite him easily he has nothing to get onto you

hmaiqij,,11/27/2021,1,,[removed]
hmbk52n,ARMIsNOTLoaded,11/27/2021,1,365.0,That is the reason why if you want to play support in low elo just pick an AP carry mage (or Pyke/Panth) and 1vs9. If you want to play something team-reliant like an enchanter/engager you have to pray your team is competent enough to finalize the plays you can set up for them.  Traditional supports multiply the efficiency of their team. If you are 100 but your team is zero 100 \* 0 = 0.  In higher elos this goes the opposite since traditional supports brings much more stuff on the table than AP carries and their chances to have a competent team around them are way higher.
hm97a12,brokerZIP,11/27/2021,1,,Slayers are divided into assasins and skirmishers. And everyone you listed in first sentence are skirmishers including Lillia. Yes she is a skirmisher because shes not tanky and has good mobility to be a juggernaut. AND she cant be mage/battlemage because of her low range (E doesnt count due to high cooldown not to mention that you max E last on her).Yet she has sustained damage with dot and low cd low range ability AND she has a heal. Shes clearly a skirmisher
hm9943z,jjhassert,11/27/2021,1,198.0,Im gonna get hate for this but I dont like it. The beat boxers are ok. The singing felt very off key
hma2nwr,delahunt,11/27/2021,1,12388.0,I love that everything that happens in Arcane gets traced back to Jayce doing illegal dangerous research in his apartment with shitty security. Every plot point comes naturally from that first one. The only hiccup is Vi leaving Ekko to handle Jinx at the end of episode 7 and that is relatively minor.
hm95ras,venomstrike31,11/27/2021,1,38.0,But even this link calls juggernauts a subclass of fighter. Both juggernauts and divers are fighters (bruisers) I think its weird to imply that champs like Illaoi Yorick and Sett arent bruisers.

hmantgc,tanezuki,11/27/2021,1,85.0,Well Thornmail specfically answers this ? Armor and antiheal.   Also building Thornmail doesnt mean I wouldnt build Randuin in a classic comp (where theres usually only one AP with maybe an AP support who doesnt deal damage).

hmbhm1n,Trias00,11/27/2021,1,10.0,Yeah thats logical. If you have to choose between acing the enemy team and clearing one minion wave the latter is an obvious choice. Thats really smart.  PS. I was playing support.

hmaqgw3,Lozzizl3,11/27/2021,1,986.0,What about a honour system for voice chat? Promoting people to act right to receive rewards?  Or x amount of team reports = voice chat suspension for the season  There could be simple mute options in loading screen  Even if some people choose not to use mic it’s also good to listen to someone else feeding info and stops tunnel vision
hmbhxcf,Soulsek,11/27/2021,1,5.0,I think the cost decrease of Everfrost is going to hurt him. He is a slippery champion and that item is the anti slippery . Lower cooldown too.
hm9eych,funslammer,11/27/2021,1,11.0,In dia it’s probably Jungle > mid/ support impact wise.
hm9n8pn,pelacur,11/27/2021,1,132.0,Ghost was mid tier ADC at best before he won Worlds. Players can have resurgence I dont know why people are so fixated that if players didnt have an explosive debut then the players cant improve.  I dont even rate Doran that high but rating Zeus above Doran is freaking funny.

hma1jab,hiccup333,11/27/2021,1,12378.0,I felt EXACTLY the same way.  Like really ruined the character of Vi for me.  Felt like she was doing the bare minimum in the dinner scene.  And like you said she also already walked away from Jinx on the bridge scene earlier.  For me the whole hook of the show was their relationship I was really disappointed by the end
hm97c4u,Krateling,11/27/2021,1,4.0,Targamas is not a rookie.
hmbije4,RobbinDeBank,11/27/2021,1,88.0,Well I only play Aram now so don’t take my words too seriously. But I really like the new mythics and new tear item for tank. It just opens up a lot more build paths for ryze to go a bit more like a battle mage as he used to be instead of having to rush full damage to nuke the enemy before they nuke you.
hm9x7yx,Shashara,11/27/2021,1,8.0,literally everyone has streaks like that sometimes fair mmr or not.  op has an attitude problem not an mmr problem. if you get this upset over losing you need to stop playing a game where youre *designed* to lose about 50% of the time.  losing 15 out of 20 is not that weird and absolutely not a mark of an unfair mmr. youd lose about 10 out of 20 normally so going 15 out of 20 is perfectly normal its only 5 losses more than what youd get if you always had a perfect 50% winrate... which nobody does.
hm99357,CreamyAlmond,11/27/2021,1,65.0,Yeah the chemtech dragon is very distinctly green too despite all chemtech-related stuffs in Arcane being purple so far.  Tbh chances are theyve not thought it through previously simply green means toxic lul toxic Zaun means chemtech. In the show they make it quite clear that green gases and shit are poisonous as fuck and shimmer is purple.
hm98vh6,hassanfanserenity,11/27/2021,1,54.0,Evelynns W can be dodged if your quick enough the regular W not the empowered one
hmaxjxb,Aikairi,11/27/2021,1,206.0,Yeah I agree if people just stop playing on auto-pilot and think about shit you climb so much faster and it will eventually turn into muscle memory.  Checking own replays in lower elos might work but its not as efficient as just watching YouTube videos and playing while thinking because sometimes there will be mistakes that can easily be spotted but what about the other mistakes that require more in-depth knowledge that a Bronze player cant possibly know? Shit like jungle-tracking cooldown management wave control micro-movements.
hma1xbb,bronet,11/27/2021,1,327.0,Okay?

Because they dont care and/or never learn.   For them its like saying shame on you for saying that now behave they.. dont.. care..  Should there be another punishment like banning them for a day or two? Still dont think it would help..  Turn the chat off and/or ignore those kind of people in game is my advice :)

hmaajka,CanIBeFIREIn10Years,11/27/2021,1,5.0,Idk man. This is just part of what you have to deal with when playing LoL. IMO it is normal to be angry in this kind of situation. However if it keeps repeating over and over its not good for you at all.   Regardless of why you play LoL raging at them would be harmless to them and harmful for you so my suggestion is to either find a duo/team or just forget about them and move on.
hmbkw8s,Zcooger,11/27/2021,1,172.0,Make sure that red eye icon is displayed above Eve head instead of exclamation mark once she is detected by control ward. That will be the best indication.

hma07kh,tautckus1,11/27/2021,1,25.0,Lets just ignore that 3 careers were either ruined or put a stop to. Oh wait nisqy is out of a job. Adam had his rookie year ruined and bwipo had to flee to na to escape his tragic worlds mental boom that turns out was caused by a incosidarate prick
hma7st7,rueckhand,11/27/2021,1,145.0,Wait he has free time while dealing with family issues that he decides to spend with his gf? Nahhhh
hmb41zi,00Dandy,11/27/2021,1,34.0,I generally dislike all the negativity surrounding this game. I know it has become a meme but many people are serious when they say League is a bad game.  And it often seems like saying League is a good game is a controversial opinion in this sub. Which is so strange when you consider that League is the most popular online game on the planet.   I think many people just cant handle losing or competitive environments in general so they blame their frustrations on the game (or their teammates).   I play LoL since 2015 and I love it honestly. I also watch a lot of LoL esports.
hmbks5c,PaulTheIII,11/27/2021,1,,You can’t indefinitely push your lane you have to eventually leave it for an objective like dragon or baron to win the game. If you don’t they will. If you do they can trade dragon for a turret (individual dragons are very weak).  That’s my point there’s always a way they can trade objectives and there’s nothing you can do about it. You can’t defend everything at once
hm9yhk4,SaulJoker,11/27/2021,1,21.0,How do you implement adaptive stat conversion that gives the player the stat they want without letting them choose the stat directly? It doesn’t seem feasible nor reasonable *if you include HP*  Obviously the items aren’t inherently too strong for the champions in an isolated context. If you’re talking about a Mordekaiser buying Frozen Heart and getting 20 extra AP from it instead of the mana and ONLY that then that seems fine right?  The problem arises when you start to look at how those items synergize with other items as well as the champion’s kit. Can you imagine if Mordekaiser could build a cost efficient Liandry + Frozen Heart on top of the items he already buys like Demonic Embrace and Rylai’s? Do you not realize how absurdly broken that would make him?  You’d think Vladimir wouldn’t be a problem until you realize Vladimir can also buy those mana items convert their mana to AP AND HP and suddenly scale even harder than he did before? There’d be no point in dealing with him late game because he’d be a massive stat check.  Have you thought about how ridiculous Rumble’s numbers could get?  No. There’s not enough thought put on the “what happens next” it’s just an idea that seems good on paper but in practice would cause a lot of problems.  EDIT: forgot to add a part to the first paragraph  EDIT 2: Also it’s unfair to compare the previous iteration of Liandry’s to the current because Vlad didn’t build the old morello that gave mana but he does build the new one that doesn’t. Meaning there will always be items that champions gravitate towards regardless of what the items in the game actually are.

hm9x0lm,SaulJoker,11/27/2021,1,22.0,I don’t blame you if I were an outsider looking into this thread I’d probably think the same. Really dumb debate about something that’s not even relevant to the post.
hmbcjix,UndeadMurky,11/27/2021,1,125.0,From the winning pov yes but from the losing team pov going from 9% win to 13% is huge thats nearly +50% chance to win.
hm9oraf,EvesLostInches,11/27/2021,1,94.0,I think she drops aggro tho? Not sure. I haven’t played her a lot this pre season. If i turret dive and the turret aggro will kill me cause i didn’t get out fast enough i ult and that ends up saving me. Idk if i misunderstood the question/ if you end up failing to ult out of turret range thats a different story

hmaznwl,Amsement,11/27/2021,1,222.0,I wish youd try using your brain and see why teams dont want to sign Jensen. Youve provided literally 0 actual context to anything youve claimed but call me lazy how ironic.   Stats without context dont tell you anything meaningful and what do the stats in this infographic actually tell you about Jensens performance this year. You can watch his games and see he didnt perform to the standard people have for him and in regards to LS you can literally watch the videos on his youtube where he comments on Jensen. Ive linked 2 or 3 and you still insist on saying LS said this or that without backing up any of your claims.  Ill explain this for like the third time now. Spending a shit ton of money to buyout Jensen and pay his salary is not worth it for most of these teams. It doesnt guarantee them an LCS trophy nor does it guarantee them a deep run at worlds. If his price was more reasonable/maybe if he was a FA his situation would be different. If youre so confident you know better than these teams then provide some actual context to your claims.
hma6d4u,Angry---train,11/27/2021,1,71.0,Ashe and Draven become better and everyone else is the same as before
hmb3zuh,LoLrovex,11/27/2021,1,341.0,Well I think you partially answered your own question. You do gotta buy control wards if you want better vision. Aside from that as a split pusher when you hit lvl 9 swap to blue trinket and you can easily play vision on demand.
hmb5opv,aNumberFiveLarge,11/27/2021,1,530.0,The little scenes really did it for me in particular - Jinx when Silco is telling her that enforcers are dead and shes just *slighly* increasing her smile and slightly nodding and then later on when Ekko taunts her into a duel with his stopwatch for those brief 1.5secs you can see her look at him look at stopwatch look back at him and scowl in disbelief animations truly were out of this world.  Hope they keep the quality for S2. Well they kinda *need* to otherwise their show will get butchered the same way One Punch Man season 2 was butchered you cant deliver greatness and then underdeliver later on.
hma1yvp,outthawazoo,11/27/2021,1,21.0,I think the only time the music *didnt* work was whenever it was Imagine Dragons. Every other scene with music whether it was original score or any of the great pieces created by other artists they were all incredibly well done. So many scenes were elevated from good to phenomenal because of music choices. The Ekko vs Jinx scene is one of the greatest thing Ive ever seen and the music was *perfect* for it.
hmameen,JesiAsh,11/27/2021,1,15.0,He is not dead as a champion because he is not a wolf in the show and because show itself is a god-damn prequel. Dunno what you want to prove.

hmavk8h,Ghostkill221,11/27/2021,1,502.0,No shes still psychotic.  She doesnt take violence as a last option she lets her live of violence eclipse her value for the people she cares about. Its why she hits her allies and even nearly shoots Vi.  She loves violence more than anything else.
hmabvlc,ReganDryke,11/27/2021,1,55.0,Your mistake was to get anywhere near that bush when the drake was up.

hmahvzt,SP3EDI,11/27/2021,1,376.0,of course there is. Faker would never demand of others to inform them about everything so he can decide if it was valid enough reason in his books or not. If you knew even a little thing about faker then you would know that he values family and privacy extremely high. Just like Hily did without much drama. Only those entitled idiots demand drama especially online on twitter and divert hate to others online.

hmawf7m,Not_A_KPOP_FAN,11/27/2021,1,8.0,Basically all of Ionian champs some noxian champs due to the friendly fire thing Demacian champs too since theyll assume him as a weapon supplier for noxus.  Piltover for obvious reasons.   That leaves the yordles void bilgewater shurima and fjord champs as the only neutral characters towards him as far as arcane lore is concerned.
hmbey65,GoatRocketeer,11/27/2021,1,154.0,I think it was a pro play thing.  The revive let him frontline extremely well for a champion that doesnt get shit on in lane like most tanks do. Both passable laning and frontlining are a lot more powerful in pro than they are for the regular playerbase so I assume they removed the revive to prevent another azir/ryze/release rakan/release ornn problem.
hm9kgaf,CiastekBT,11/27/2021,1,130.0,+8 years? It has been said in the interview with Fortiche that Arcane has been in production for 6 years. These things dont suddenly pop out of apple trees.   In the end its more like Riot decided to wait 2 years to take the step towards Arcane.
hmbq3fu,ConquestViking,11/27/2021,1,156.0,Maybe riot even made  a song for worlds 2018 named after him so it kinda makes sense.
hmacut9,OilOfOlaz,11/27/2021,1,311.0,First and foremost I would respect my wifes wish not to tell it anyone if she said so and that might have been the case here as well (wich is obviously speculation).  > Well Fnatics LoL team isnt a group of 5 accountants who see each other in the office and they werent in Reykjavík for recreational activities and team bonding either.  I work as an event manager before I started working freelance I saw my closest collegues on average more often then my wife weeks 60-90 woring hours werent that unusual and we essentially went out and drink basically every night in the first few years cuz it was often for free and you had a bunch of ppl that had a ton of build up stress they wanted to drown.  I wasnt a pro player on FNC but pretty close to many ppl I worked together with.   > Seriously? Guys my wife was just taken to the hospital I gotta take the next flight home. You wouldnt share that with people at work? People you work with 6 or 7 days a week? 12 hours a day? The people who are about to get shit on at the thing everyone worked for a year cause you gotta leave?  yeah seriously my wife is a doctor you actually cant imagine how many ppl hide severe illnesses even from their partners and children if someone has cancer.   If she doesnt want anyone to know that shes severly ill you wont go on record and tell my team that consists of ppl that Ive been working together with for most of the past decade just because shit like this makes the rounds in my job pretty quickly and ppl start asking stuff about it. Now imagine that with 5 public figures on your team who regularly interact with other ppl in the scen and fans and someone might spill the beans for sure I mean it actually happend every time sth happend behind the scenes in lol.  > Again say your wife has a medical emergency and that shes in the hospital. Why are you so hellbent on hiding that from your colleagues. Its the 21st century. People are pretty receptive to illness and the act of seeking medical treatment.  Because ppl will the approach my wife and ask her about the medical emergency she is not willing to let other ppl know about.

hm98xpw,Frozen_Watcher,11/27/2021,1,103.0,I dunno dude I would take asking what about us and thinking about the other girl you just met in less than a week in showering as more obvious indications of romantic interest than calling someone sweet as cupcake which the other guy suggested to be more undeniable.
hmao2d2,RurouniMiyamoto,11/27/2021,1,18.0,No anti-heal
hm9ub6e,SaulJoker,11/27/2021,1,20.0,It’s not about Tear it’s about resourceless champions being able to buy shit like Luden’s/Frozen Heart and be way more effective with those items than champions that actually utilize the mana.  And then they’ll have to make the numbers so low that the item is just not worth buying anyways.  Don’t even get me started on the ridiculous amount of bugs it would cause with champions like Viego Modekaiser and Sylas.
hmafu9k,cav2010,11/27/2021,1,,If that happen then so be it but its all speculation at this point whether they confront him or not if he want to share it with them then he would naturally do it if team depend on a player that only could perform 10% of his capacity then theyre pretty fuck anyway.

hmau2r5,boostedben1,11/27/2021,1,112.0,Nuguri is the only Korean that hadnt ever fully integrated socially with the four members of FPX. Gimgoon and Khan both integrated socially into FPX. When Gimgoon first joined FPX his Chinese wasnt that great. Out of three Korean tops Nuguri is the only one that hasnt been able to connect with them. Im not trying to blame Nuguri but I think that history has shown that FPX and its members which has stayed the same for three years do try really hard to become good team mates and friends with a foreign player. Honestly this might just have to be  due to personality differences as Nuguri is introverted. But it is not right to say that they only try 2 or 3 times when history says differently
hmardav,_imrahulyadav,11/27/2021,1,71.0,Yes Im fresh new started 2 day ago.
hm9ff3r,Bajentrash,11/27/2021,1,3.0,I think the orgs wait until the team gets together in Berlin in a day or two to start bootcamping. Its easier to make great content when players are in place physicly.  Since the season starts earlier next year my guess is all teams botcamp/scrimm from 1 december until christmas and then resume after new year.
hm9insd,hibari112,11/27/2021,1,19.0,I think its not fair because in China they always were able to use those. So I think Riot was like: whatever just allow it everywhere.

hma5flv,Samsonkoek,11/27/2021,1,147.0,I respect Upset for doing his own thing but this sort of situation was bound to happen (not with it exploding on twitter but more internally) I think even if Upset doesnt like it in 90% of the cases it is the right call to tell your teammates.  So if he finds it worth to protect the privacy over everything that happend then sure it is his choice but I can imagine most teammates would be frustrated over it.
hmaocwg,NonnagLava,11/27/2021,1,70.0,Because Im pretty sure a number of these are AId versions of actual League art. Like the AI searched Noxus and found Swains base splash art and God-King Darius and tried to make a picture based on those (and others) for Noxus.  Same Im pretty sure Freljords art is based on one of the Ornn stories cover art as is Shurimas. They all look like art Im fairly confident Riot has used at some point or another just not actually a picture of the art just something *based* on that art.

hmb02pc,LoLrovex,11/27/2021,1,341.0,Yone after lethal tempo is just an absurd champion that needs to be nerfed it has good gank prevention fighting and outplay potential ALL throughout the game. Playing ADCs top require you to be strongsided by your entire team basically which isnt reliable in soloq so I always try to avoid them. Be consistent dont die to ganks and stay ahead of everyone else.

hmagx8p,SaulJoker,11/27/2021,1,26.0,Emotional abuse? That’s called being a coach man. You see this in every sport. Coaches need to motivate their players and if what it takes is a passionate rant about how they can play better then that’s what the coach will do.  He literally berated Flandre for 20 minutes straight in front of the entire team when he would rage quit scrims. He never did it again. Surprise surprise.
hmb6oxc,TeeTheSame,11/27/2021,1,163.0,People have to accept that in a professional team not everyone has to be friends with each other. If Nuguri is not participating socially but doing his job well then you shouldnt make a problem out of that. Coaching staff has to solve actual conflicts and work on team performance gameplay. I think Nuguris gameplay was fine from what I saw most of the time. He doesnt need to talk at all if he gets the job done.

hmap22l,LazerFruit,11/27/2021,1,27.0,Blind pick is the worst way to play the game. Draft wont necessarily reduce the fighting ingame but people wont be arguing over roles and whatnot during champ select so theres less immediate toxicity.

hmbn159,FantasyTrash,11/27/2021,1,,>Why should he have any respect for someone who refuses to trust him with information   I didnt say respect him as a person but respecting someones privacy is not earned like trust is is it expected. It is not Adams business in the slightest what Upset chooses to share about his family with the team and it is **especially** not his business to post about someone elses private matters on Twitter.  >We know damn well that if given the true reason it would’ve ended up in his post  >We dont.  Seeing as he told everyone what he claims Upset told the team and didnt show any restraint we can reasonably infer that his post wouldve included the true reason.  >Hyli was given the chance to get to know the truth Adam didnt. How would that make you feel when youre 5 humans in the team?  How old are you? Because welcome to the real world. Your close colleagues are not going to share every piece of personal information with you and it is none of your business to inquire about private matters they choose not to share with you but to then air it out on Twitter when you dont get the answer youre looking for.  >If anyone behaved unprofessionally its Upset choosing certain coworkers to know the truth and leave others in the dark.  It is not unprofessional to choose which colleagues you share private information with. He had an obligation to tell Yamato and Dardo which he did. Anyone else he chose to tell is his business and his business alone.

hm9glgs,oVnPage,11/27/2021,1,34.0,Yes the storyline in a 40 hour fully voiced RPG is better than the story in 50 lines of text essentially displayed in a web browser. Whod have thought?  Riot has hopefully learned their lesson: Dont do big stories like SOL in the League client. Give them the space they deserve.
hmachv7,D4v26,11/27/2021,1,91.0,Bc prime gaming said that? Idk
hm97cid,WeirdChamp960,11/27/2021,1,4.0,I hope this never comes. Burnout already is a huge problem in esports. Mad didnt get a single break this entire year with worlds and MSI. If they also have to play a tournament in offseason because some fans are unpatient as fuck they would have no break ever. Thats basically the recipe for a guaranteed Burnout
hmb0t02,Bananaeater45,11/27/2021,1,147.0,Because the vocal point if this thread is that somehow nuguri was a major problem in FPX this year which he wasnt.  He was the best top in LPL spring and was the only reason FPX didnt go 0-6. Blaming him for FPXs shortcomings seems irresponsible and disingenious when all of his teammates played like shit the entire tournament.  Me focussing on doinb malz is because a build is the simpliest part of playing a champion. If one decides to first time a champion and does not even do the research of why it is good and simpmy goes i lost scrims to it it must be strong then you are literally playing for fun while being paid millions to actually innovate abd drive the game further something doib did in 2019 which is why they won worlds.

hmaj73v,Arraysion,11/27/2021,1,20.0,Resistances matter if you are ahead or if youre tanking. Otherwise yes it makes sense for resistances to not really matter when you just buy one defensive item on a squishy champion.  Also its really disingenuous to say that Zhonyas and Banshees are bad items due to their raw stats since their item effects are extremely powerful and at least in the case of Zhonyas have warped metas for years.

hmb5r48,tanezuki,11/27/2021,1,89.0,Some AD champions like Ezreal have AP scalings and can totally have AP builds even if theyre not meta.   Some champions cannot do that those whos scalings are entirely AD but its clear in their identity that theyre not AP champions.   Juggernauts are the champions closest in defensive stats to tanks.   I wouldnt care the slightest if I cant use Runaan on Sett but making one of the most important tank items in this meta unusable is just annoying.   Nasus is my prime example because Im a main and you dont build anything than Divine Sunderer before going tank except for maybe Sterak. The fact you can get ultra kited means you have to buid like a tank because otherwise youll just never get into melee to anything while remaining alive.

hma8tet,Outfox3D,11/27/2021,1,83.0,The problem is that you have to be able to stick to a target BEFORE you get access to the range increase and that the combat stats it offers (to ranged) are very lackluster. So you have to be a champion that can stick to a target safely for the windup that then somehow still needs extra range (despite being able to stick) that also doesnt need a rune that gives combat power in lane.   Theres maybe ... 3 champions I can think of where this rune MIGHT be a workable decision and maybe 1 or 2 more where it could concievably be good. Its super niche. Its strong but super super niche.
hmafgjg,SaulJoker,11/27/2021,1,,No?  If you’re going Chempunk you’re still going to get Randuin’s right?.  Oh right you said “well then you get melted by % hp damage” like yeah no shit sherlock. There has to be counterplay somewhere you can’t be good at everything.
hmbc0ez,LoLrovex,11/27/2021,1,354.0,1. Small Champ pool   2. Know if youre weakside or strongside and leash accordingly.   3. If theres already 30 carry players on your team you might as well pick a tank   4. Dont be afraid to walk to other lanes if youre frozen on   5. Eat jungle camps

hm9ro05,tanezuki,11/27/2021,1,60.0,But at least they can proc it.   Nasus for example if it worked with slows could only proc it on one person but at least hed be able to use the effect. Same for Illaoi with her E. Some would still get nothing though (Garen unless you count Stridebreaker)

hm97c48,Xonra,11/27/2021,1,170.0,Then he shouldnt have the right to be mad they are making assumptions or pissed off at him. All signs are more so pointing to him bullshitting as there is plenty of reason to believe he left for his significant other and zero (aside from his fake outrage) his leaving was actually family related.   He has been proven to have lied yet people are still just blindly defending him. Alphari unintentionally disputed his claim that Alphari approached him when it was the other way around. 3 different teammates at 3 different times have disputed his claim of mentioning anything but his significant other and problems with them (literally the day before he left) for reasons he might of left as he apparently said nothing else.

hm9akst,InRoyal,11/27/2021,1,,Yeah by 1 place I Think you know what he is trying to say. He is not arguing if he is better than anyone at the top. He is arguing that he is still one of the better midlaners and would place him in the good-decent caregory of midlaners which he can be even if he is worse than half the midlaners. But if you wanna be technically accurate you are right it just isnt really the point he is trying to argue.

hm8un2a,daddymateriial,11/27/2021,1,18.0,I know wave management perfectly I can freeze any wave. I even know how to do the wave manipulation at the beginging to make the enemy top miss 1 minion. Thats not the problem its the fact that my junglers dont help me while the enemy jgs gank at every oppertunity.
hm9lb3q,TH3RM4L33,11/27/2021,1,230.0,It also happens on melee Q but melee Q going on cooldown when it hits its fine - its problem is that it goes on cooldown before the cast is completed too. Ranged Q however has no cast time so it should go on cooldown only once (in the moment it was used).
hm9gy9w,Fun_Carrot6597,11/27/2021,1,201.0,DL retired after taking part in the worst performance of a first seed time in league history. He does not guarantee a free trip to worlds especially now after taking a year off and having his drama queen stream meltdowns.

hma1oam,NO_FNX_NO_MAJOR,11/27/2021,1,59.0,> This doesnt inherently make him an aa based assassin.  but he is an aa based assassin. Look HoB isnt ideal on Rengar you are completely correct but what is with this misinformation? Most of his damage literally comes from an auto attack. No he isnt a carry but thats not what you said for the first part of your sentence. Yes Talon and Zed have impactful autos but its not most of their damage unlike Rengar.  > HoB. is. trash. I dont even have to say HoB is trash on rengar its just fucking trash on its own. Its only playable on like kalista twitch tryndamere.  Kaisa and Tristana as well. In fact they have the exact same reason for going it as AP Twitch so surely you dont disagree right? otherwise you are spreading more misinformation. It also was the best rune on Ashe for a while (not sure since preseason) and viable on Varus and Draven.  > Rengar builds maybe one crit item and he doesnt build it for the crit  Its not a maybe he does built a crit item. And he does build more crit items often. Its the most reliable way of one shotting someone mid to late game  >Crit is an objectively bad stat on rengar. It performs poorly. This isnt debatable. Its in the stats.  Every stat site Ive ever been on shows crit performing well on Rengar later into the game (obviously go lethality to start). Even high elo players build it. You are completely wrong on this.
hmb1qts,ChemicalExperiment,11/27/2021,1,769.0,I really hope they tell Warwicks story from his perspective lost memories and all. Make it the thoughline of the season with him getting flashbacks as he attacks Vi and Jinx. Make the big reveal that Vander is Warwick come from his own realization so that along with the surprise we get the trauma of him realizing what hes become. Throughout the season hed be a main antagonist against Jinx and Vi and by the end hed have to grapple with all the terrible things hes done to them as this monster without realizing who they were to him.

hm9ms86,azersub,11/27/2021,1,3.0,Super interesting look into the spring and summer season of worlds champs.  It is crazy to see how far Jiejie has come. He used to literally shake from pressure of a pro match to hard gapping best jungler in the world in game 5 of finals...  And i never knew Flandre was/used to be like that in scrims but looks like EDG has some great coaches to solve that situation.  Also i really wish there was more of Scout in there. He seems genuinly hilarious

hmaafjc,tortillakingred,11/27/2021,1,70.0,Nahhh they aren’t. Corejj is probably a top 5 support in the world. If he went to a Korean or Chinese team he could probably be a top 2 support within 1 split… Blaber and Spica are great but they aren’t world class talent like Corejj
hmbpcnx,Protoniic,11/27/2021,1,33.0,That about how many voicelines he has.
hm98cca,liamera,11/27/2021,1,34.0,I was hoping for more depth than recent anecdotal experience. :S   54% WR is definitely a strong champion but just saying they carried in a bunch of your recent matches doesnt really explain 54% at all.
hmb7k4s,crazydavy,11/27/2021,1,197.0,They just dont want to put the time into it because it doesnt make the company money. But they overlook how nostalgic and important stuff like that is to a video game. Every year League gets more bland.

hmb7z3e,Buffsub48wrchamp,11/27/2021,1,,I still think referring to a higher rank to gage whats meta is still stupid. Meta in high elo is not the same as low elo so look at relevant stats for your rank to gage whats meta

hma983g,Zapor666,11/27/2021,1,15.0,When how about rip off ALL dashes frod adc and delete ability to self peeling for everyone? Why EVERY champ in game have a multiple pros and only Kog doesnt?
hmbcd6s,SkeletonJakk,11/27/2021,1,263.0,Luckily none of them have 16% pickrate and 52% winrate so thats a relief huh?  And banrate is irrelevant people ban what they dont like simple as.
hm99yl7,DHSUAUGEV,11/27/2021,1,16.0,Yes you and some other people but they probably have statistics showing the majority of people didnt care. It completely ruins clarity.

hmb8odi,-Falrein,11/27/2021,1,52.0,Theres no such thing as a single main character on Runeterra.  Sure Ryze travels around and gathers the World Runes so they dont end up destroying the world. I dont think that makes him the center point of Runeterra.  Each character has different scopes and powers and levels of influence but it doesnt make them lesser or better. They all influence the world in their own way some more than others. They all deserve to have their stories told they are all main character of their own stories.  Ryze is a main character. Of many.
hmbf6oq,p47r,11/27/2021,1,36.0,sweet got it tnx
hmawo1t,aluxmain,11/27/2021,1,23.0,there are so many point and click stuff that you cant simply dodge.  what you describe apply to any poke lane...  what about blitz/naut/any hook champ that must hit you just ONCE and you die? isnt that worse?  at least to die to lux you have to get hit over and over and eventually recall or die but vs hooks you need only ONE mistake.  lux damage early is kinda useless you finish mana before they finish hp
hmbf9wt,vegeful,11/27/2021,1,12.0,Yes this is also my thought lol.
hmb4xwl,Hadonski,11/27/2021,1,206.0,I never said that the game should be balanced around higher elos did I? I simply said that in higher elos its below 50%wr. People usually refer to whats meta by looking at higher elos and pro play. So I just wanted to take that into context too when talking about viability of the rune.
hm9n42y,Kreth,11/27/2021,1,408.0,Pasdive aggressive? Ive never played on eune but ive got enough deaththreats to last me some more lifes.
hmaygcc,SleepyLabrador,11/27/2021,1,4.0,> The dodge penalty is questionable enough due to the omnipresence of players who are supremely unpleasant in low rank play and the numerous accounts higher rank players tend to have  It was NEVER designed to fix that issue. All the people who dodge have multiple accounts that they use for climbing so they can just dodge and cycle through those accounts. Ill admit I dodge A LOT and use 3 accounts for that purpose because otherwise I get pissed off at the game and become unmotivated to play. By dodging I continue to enjoy the game.
hmam8hu,Jstin8,11/27/2021,1,28.0,Yeah but the kicker right now is that those percent pen items are just as good as your 2-3 item as it is at item number 6. And as soon as they buy it 2nd or 3rd they turn your entire tank build into wasted gold.  Throw in the fact that tanks cant even get online have the weakest early game they have ever had AND the fact you can get an anti tank mythic and theres a reason Riot has been straight buffing tanks and their items last season and this preseason
hmb9ynt,PixiCode,11/27/2021,1,52.0,You forgot characters who would center around Noxus and Ionia while still exploring parts of the world for one reason or another. Katarina is probably a big one? for Noxus. For Ionia it would probably be Yasuo due to his presence in marketing and his ability to wander around but Akali or Jhin would fit too.
hm99j55,Kikirigana,11/27/2021,1,54.0,Oh god dont waste your energy.  He clearly meant to say that bugs would be better acknowledge and possibly fixed quicker if people put into detail what the bug is when it happened and other important details.

hmafj92,TabaCh1,11/27/2021,1,112.0,Bruh Riot was owned by Tencent since 2011. This is all on Riot
hma549e,fojek17,11/27/2021,1,47.0,This analogy doesnt really work for league.   I completely agree with it but it just doesnt apply to league. Heres an analogy from me:  If I enjoy going to the theater that doesnt mean I have to enjoy watching every single play ever made. On the other hand the fact that I do not enjoy it doesnt mean that I am allowed to kick everyone out of the theater regardless whether they enjoy it or not. We are only allowed to leave the theather together as a group and as such everyone should have a say whether they want to watch it until the end or not. I myself might not like the play but I should respect the fact someone else in the audience might be feeling like he is watching the best play of his life.  See the problem with your type of thinking is that is completely devoid of empathy. Someone might hate the play while others might love it. There might also be people who are interested in seeing the whole play just to see how the plot develops even though they did not like the first act. Your idea is that you are the only one with a valid and correct opinion and everyone else should adjust to it instead of making their own judgement on watching the play or not. If the play is shitty to you then everyone should leave the theatre and people who are enjoying the play are just troll who keep you hostage in the theatre

hm9gbad,mogadichu,11/27/2021,1,11.0,League might offer you some comfort in life so dont drop it completely but it doesnt sound like its gonna help with the first question in the long run. Have you considered saving up some money and traveling? Might open up some perspectives. Could also try out a new sport or hobby. I know a lot of people tend to either get into fitness or traveling when they feel lost in life.

hm9i27l,Noman_Blaze,11/27/2021,1,389.0,Excuse me? Only idiots like you ask for region lock in Dota 2. It will kill ranked in a lot of regions if it ever happens and majority doesnt want it. Its not like people speak English all the time in EUW in LOL anyway. I play there and a lot of players dont even use English.   On the other hand atleast Russians arent that big of an issue in EUW(In Dota 2) and US region is full of whiners anyway. Have you seen how toxic it is towards big name players? No wonder US teams have become a meme in that game and only worthwhile team is EG.

hm9etao,Dastu24,11/27/2021,1,13.0,I also noticed that ingame performance is easily overuled by all players mmr? I could carry the game 14/3/9 and earn 14lp while the rest were 3/3 but other game i would make mistakes die barely managed to lane and contribute with cc ending 3/9/5 doing nothing but csing but still being 50 creeps behind getting carried and getting 18lp (these two games where in succession)

hm9xzsj,montlogan,11/27/2021,1,16.0,Every role is equally as impactful. As adc you can carry by positioning right and not feeding in lane. As support you can carry by roaming and getting vision. As top lane you can carry by map pressure and utilizing teleport effectively. As jungle you can carry by map pressure and effective counter ganks/counter jungling (counter ganks are WAY more important than actual ganks because you prevent deaths and get kills in the process). As mid lane you can carry by map pressure and getting fed. IMO mid is the hardest lane to carry because your playing against a bunch of egotistical people who think they can 1v9 every single game (at least in plat and diamond minus lux mains who afk every game). Mid mains are the worst they all think they’re 6 tiers better than they actually are and tend to rage the most.

hmbnqgv,JohnCornewaille,11/27/2021,1,156.0,Disagreed Sylas isnt even the main character of Demacia since Lux fills that spot much better.   Runeterra works much better when you think of an ensable cast with multiple points of view. And that works with every region having a small number of focused characters on it that participate in various levels of that regions story and moves the various plots along while interacting with minor characters (from the storys perspective) and having personal arcs that makes them grow. Both Arcane and Ruined King are good examples of this (and while the event sucked and there isnt a true canon to it SoL has some of this too).  Ryze while being very important probably will rarely take the main spot on an event outside something with the World Runes.
hmbimre,Alex_Wizard,11/27/2021,1,5.0,Shaco tends to be stronger in the early and mid game than he is late. Average game length has increased because of the new bounty system so early game focused champions are slightly weaker in the current meta. One mistake by the winning team in the mid game can result in the enemy team catching up negating any early leads Shaco builds.   There are also a few new rune and item adjustments that have indirectly buffed other champions and make it harder for Shaco to do his job. For example Viktor has sharply increased in win rate and primarily runs Crown. Since a big portion of Shaco’s damage is front loaded he has less opportunities to make plays in his games. To my knowledge Shaco isn’t really a prominent user of any of the new runes or items so he was indirectly nerfed from them.
hmb9fnf,shaidyn,11/27/2021,1,9.0,I think when league first started the idea was Demacia good Noxus bad. Things have evolved over time and become more grey.  These days Demacia is a good kingdom as long as you follow the rules and dont use magic and Noxus is a good kingdom as long as youre willing to go to any lengths to prove yourself stronger than your peers.  Noxians probably think Noxus is great. The people getting rolled over by Noxus probably not so much.

hmbdiuk,NymphomaniacWalrus,11/27/2021,1,94.0,Just because its a shit item doesnt mean its not a bruiser item.  Its an item designed to be used by bruisers against magic damage heavy comps so they can survive the burst. Steraks Gage outshines it in every capacity but theyre still both bruiser items.  Same reason youd call Vigilant Wardstone a support item even though no one builds it either.

hm9gqnq,CuriousPipe8558,11/27/2021,1,13.0,I love league and I never minded playing alone when ppl were offline but I could always discord and stuff with friends and we did a lot of flex. But now I’m just really alone on league haha. I did travel a bit to nyc/Vegas with some real life friends from college (making a little >200k/yr and as a fellow gamer you know our only expenditure is computer internet and food) so I have plenty to waste on vacation. But main issue is like having spent like most of the last 8-9 years of my life pretty much only gaming it’s hard to really make convos and feel apart of the group when I’m with people who don’t game/watch anime. I know this is probably my fault for not making more effort since they graciously let me come along but man I just miss my old league friends when we had so many people we would play in houses often. Life will never have as much of a high so I guess I just need to come to terms with it that I will eventually grow up and sadly maybe have to accept friends moving to different things :(
hma195u,delahunt,11/27/2021,1,12378.0,This. League is a specific snapshot of the character but is not tied to the lore in any way aside from vague hints in some modern VOs. Hell a bunch of champions still reference Summoners from the super old lore.  Silco as a support could be a lot of fun. It would also be interesting to see where they snapshot him to get him at his prime.

hma58vc,BahLo-,11/27/2021,1,147.0,Is it that surprising with FNC fans?
hmbrhz0,KogMawOfMortimidas,11/27/2021,1,326.0,Why would we want every champion to have a 50% winrate across the board? Should winrate factor in elo or should we aim for 50% winrate for every champion at every elo? If we try for 50% at every elo then pubstomp champions like Master Yi or Trynd who historically stomp low elo but suffer in high elo are in need of buffs AND nerfs at the same time and inversely high elo co-ordination requirement or high skill requirement champs like Azir Ryze Kalista etc. who have bad winrates in low elo and good at high elo are again also in need of buffs and nerfs at the same time. So maybe winrate shouldnt be blanket 50% across the board and some champions should have different winrates at different elos.   But then what about champion mastery curves and games played? Shouldnt a player with 500 games have a better winrate than a player picking the champ up for the first time? If both the experienced player and the new player achieve the same winrate (assuming in the same elo) then why bother mastering a champion? Why put hours into learning a champion when the improvements you make dont translate to more victories? Play easy champs play hard champs play a lot on one champ or games across multiple champs it doesnt matter because you are always at 50% winrate. So perhaps experienced players should be able to achieve high winrates on champs they master but then this leads to the classic Aurelion Sol problem where he historically has a high winrate and this is somehow problematic. Some champions will have a few dedicated masters which props the winrate up while other champions notably the flashy ones like Riven Zed YASUO etc. will be picked up by new players who dumpster the winrate because they dont know what they are doing. Perhaps a champion is actually overpowered but doesnt show it in the winrate stats because there are too many newer players who cant make it work.  Some champions are also not blind-pickable so they rarely ever get picked into bad matchups or only get picked with their absolute preference of team comp like KogMaw who almost always wants a Lulu support and hates to be picked into hook supports. Since Kog doesnt actually get to see his bad matchups he only ever gets good matchups and thus wins them more often as expected. Does this mean Kog is overpowered since he wins more? To me this sounds like Kog would actually be underpowered since he cant face bad matchups or go without his Lulu. Or maybe its neither and champions can simply be niche and have a winrate that reflects them. What about team composition? Shouldnt a well drafted team win more and so a champion that fits into more drafts or be a flex pick win more often? Perhaps a champion that fits only one extremely specific team composition perfectly will have a massively inflated winrate which fluctuates with the popularity and viability of that composition. This doesnt even begin on the differences between solo queue and pro play. Which one do we balance for? This topic alone is another essay for another day.  Another question is does winrate even equal probability to win a game if you pick this champion? Its pretty easy to see that it doesnt countering yourself in a matchup doesnt sound like you should expect to win the game even if your champ has a 52% winrate. So maybe we need to filter the winrate from all games to winrate in games where you counter pick yourself. But then maybe your champ works really well in your team comp anyways so we need to filter the sample games down even further and so on and on until you realize you are playing a truly unique game. No one has ever played the game you are about to play with the same champions players runes items movements around the map random number rolls like crits and dragons etc. etc. The sample size of games to use to determine your winrate for the upcoming match is 0 there are no games that meet the conditions required to accurately reflect the statement champion winrate equals chance to win.  Next does buffing a champion increase its winrate? Does nerfing a champion decrease its winrate? Intuitively one would believe that a buff leads to an increase while a nerf leads to a decrease but this isnt necessarily true. Sometimes buffing a champion actually decreases the winrate which is usually explained by an influx of newer players who are excited to try the buffs but cant actually play the champion. Similarly a nerf makes these Flavour of the Month players leave and go find the next buffed OP champion leaving only the actual dedicated mains who bring the winrate back up. Sometimes the champion doesnt get touched at all and the winrate changes due to a counter matchup being nerfed or an item or build path getting buffed. League is an extremely connected game you cannot touch one champion or one item and expect everything else to stand still. Xayah saw a skyrocket in winrate due to a build change and it just took the playerbase recognizing the strength of the new build to play her. Sometimes Riot does nothing at all and winrate changes like the time they said they nerfed Vladimir in the patch notes but the nerf never actually went through. Placebo effect made people perceive Vlad as being weaker despite nothing actually changing and this affected his winrate.   ___  After all this winrate to me is a rather worthless statistic easy to manipulate and almost impossible to filter to show any meaningful information. Not because we dont know how to properly filter and control for factors but simply that the idea of balance controls winrate and therefore winrate indicates good balance is just false. Across every Moba Ive played every game genre where there is a competitive scene we have to ask what we want from the game. Should one good player who is far and above anyone else at a specific champion win more often than not? Is this a sign of imbalance or a sign of a good player perhaps the best player? Or should choices such as champions in League or fighters in Smash be meaningless cosmetic choices that leave you with the same template as everyone else? Should easy and hard champions be equally as easy to win games with so that skill expression has been decoupled from victory? In any of these situations what does winrate mean and does it reflect on a game developers or communities goal on what they want from their game? To me winrate has never reflected meaningfully on ANYTHING in a team based hugely interconnected frequently balanced game like League of Legends which is why I never want to see game balanced be justified from winrate ALONE. Game balance is too complicated for any collection of simple statistics it unfortunately takes a level of feel and intuition from experienced players high elo and professional along with considerations for every other elo and player type (like ARAM players) and overall balance direction and game design to come to any decisions on who to buff and who to nerf.
hmb98jo,RaphtotheMax5,11/27/2021,1,22.0,Man thatd be insane if he was Orianas father  But also he doesnt seem like the type to make a mechanical version of her
hma93at,Falsus,11/27/2021,1,408.0,I mean women cant really get Jinx skinny and be healthy. Women need around 12% body fat at the minimum.
hm9x0un,fojek17,11/27/2021,1,6.0,of course substitute c:\\riot games\\rit client\\riotclientservices.exe with path where you have league installed
hm95o4r,GeekerVonDoom,11/27/2021,1,11.0,New mundo gets melted way too fast unless you are appreciably ahead. They nerfed his healing on his R and he lost his bonus MR passive while pen items and 60% griev are  present more than ever before. His old R at rank 1 is literally the same regen rate as new R at rank 3 lmao (60%).  They shifted some power budget to his passive to essentially have constant cc immunity lategame but he still gets shredded
hmaagys,ozmega,11/27/2021,1,311.0,the post became a thoughts memery but DL its probably the most legit person we could get to react to this.  and he is right 100%
hm9387m,bornhat,11/27/2021,1,11.0,I like the new Mundo’s E in lane better but otherwise I think he now feels way worse to play.  I used to play him a ton he was even my most played champ for a while but now I haven’t played him a single time since the week of his rework
hmbqhqh,Malarkeycreator,11/27/2021,1,225.0,You guys will complain about fucking anything

hma44d1,K1ndr3dSoul,11/27/2021,1,1.0,Necro but I agree. These words are always used in a derogatory manner
hma8b0t,GA_Deathstalker,11/27/2021,1,145.0,A lot of young people here reacting (and yes I count DL as young aswell). No just because youre an athlete youre privacy doesnt go out of the window. Maybe theres a big difference between the German and the American attitude but this whole drama is NOT about UPSETS PRIVACY its about the privacy of a THIRD PARTY that he doesnt want to reveal. And if thats anything then thats god damn commendable!
hmagclo,Roojercurryninja,11/27/2021,1,376.0,if you already have such a hard time figuring out how much you can trust your teammates then why should it be the coachs job to relay the situation to the other teammates  its better that upset does it straight up you have played together for an entire split and are leaving them at the last minute atleast tell them yourself   imagine being yamato and deciding how much exactly and in what way he would have to explain the situation he cant talk about  the odds your teammates take it poorly are going to be alot more slim if upset does it compared to it being done by yamato

hm9ym7l,Spicy_Pineapple_,11/27/2021,1,20.0,I think they’re asking specifically who’s best at taking turret shots while quickly wrecking it but Ziggs really is awesome at taking turrets with a wave. It’s literally in his kit to do just that like you mentioned. I agree with you.
hm97ee4,Lawbakgoh,11/27/2021,1,7.0,Play daily. You can get shards pretty quickly.  In one season I’ve accumulated 75 champions.  That’s more than enough to play a new champion a week.
hmae1dk,shineyumbreon,11/27/2021,1,204.0,Being hardstuck in low bronze with thousands of hours more likely than not does though. Either way there is a big mental blockade preventing him of improving. Things like that are also classified as a mental disability/condition. Afaik most abnormal things regarding mental health (anxiety stress depression anger issues etc.) are at least to some extent considered as mental disability/condition. Nothing offensive or wrong about that though.
hmbqdmm,Jordan_realYT,11/27/2021,1,588.0,Pink contacts then I’ll be happy
hmb3df1,Chivibro,11/27/2021,1,9.0,Definitely dont need a new account. People cry too much about MMR its nit gonna ruin your climb. Besides if you have low MMR in one account and you havent learned from your mistakes then youll likely get low MMR in the new account.  That also just adds to the smurf problem in League. Just learn more about how the game works and youll play better win more games raise your MMR and climb. Its not so complicated
hm9iabu,Better_Stage6862,11/27/2021,1,1.0,Yeah ok so can you explain what rule I broke here to have my post removed? If you give me an explanation then accept it & back off but Im seriously so confused. Its a literally a simple question  Is it for mis-leading titles or something silly? Despite it being fully relevant to the topic?  Was it wrong post you removed? Or are you smoking crack?
hmbdkxw,ShadyGecko,11/27/2021,1,42.0,Both should be streaming! Its like pro view but with the comms included.
hm99tjv,musashihokusai,11/27/2021,1,7.0,The Yasuo Riven Yone story.   Unless their shit got retconned.
hm936mu,KnockoutRoundabout,11/27/2021,1,7741.0,I actually hardcore disagree.  Powders meltdown was the most realistic portrayal of an ACTUAL childs meltdown Ive ever seen in media. Its not pretty little tears and soft sobs its snot and spit and screaming throwing shit and (because of the circumstances of her situation and her mentality) hitting herself as a self-punishment. Children lack the emotional regulation and control of adults and Powder specifically is in a VERY rough living situation and has been dealing with some hardcore self-esteem issues that have been building and building for likely a very long time.  Vi is/was her rock in the ocean of her tumultuous feelings so when Vi turned around and told Powder she WASNT ready it confirmed all of Powders worst fears. Sure we as viewers and adults know that Vi was just doing the right thing to keep her little sister safe. But Powder? Powder just heard the person she looks up to the most who she knows is always there for her call her weak and useless. A burden.  Powder is a powder keg (heh) of emotional trauma and her meltdown scene was the culmination of that.
hmbhhp5,Elu202,11/27/2021,1,40.0,this is sad that this dont have 1m views stupid western cant read.

hmbhdrg,Haiku71,11/27/2021,1,47.0,Honestly think it’s a great representation of what Jinx does to the character/personality of Powder.
hmbqohi,TgrCaptainkush,11/27/2021,1,11.0,Youre the guy that designed Jinx and Vi right? Must be an incredicle feeling to see 2 of the characters you created being the main characters of the first ever (of more to come hopefully) league of legends show.
hm9gmcn,K1ndr3dSoul,11/27/2021,1,32.0,I understand league has affected your mental health but for me it hasnt so I dont see why I should stop.   I too get depression anxiety and mental health issues but none are provoked or exacerbated via gaming. Instead it is a good release for me. Im sorry it has caused you pain or self worth issues.  Ive never been chat restricted or banned so I cant relate. Am curious about the chat logs.
hma8a4l,Skall77,11/27/2021,1,145.0,I dont often agree with Doublelift but he is 100% right here.   Upset telling he didnt trust his teamate was the first big red flag wtf you spend hours and hours with them playing a competitive team game and you dont trust them enough to tell them the reason you are ruinning one of the biggest moment of their life ? Who knows if Adam is gonna make world again.  Obviously family come first but it doesnt cost you anything to show your own teamate a bit of respect.
hmbjjey,KogMawOfMortimidas,11/27/2021,1,303.0,LT in lane for ADC might as well be keystone-less honestly the attack speed is so invisible.
hm94u9b,Xalethesniper,11/27/2021,1,47.0,At least for me since I can type faster on pc my mental flow translates more naturally than when written on phone.
hmad4y6,Durris,11/27/2021,1,310.0,Everyone seems to keep missing the idea that if something happened to his wife he would be spending time with her. Playing games with her sounds like spending time with her. Im glad you were able to see that possibility.

hm9poj4,dafucking,11/27/2021,1,15.0,Space Groove Lulu already existed though.
hmbcdqr,Hadonski,11/27/2021,1,263.0,What elo or criteria do you base on whether or not something is objectively good then?  e.g.: is master yi meta because he is good in lower elos?
hmahgbc,NvmSharkZ,11/27/2021,1,376.0,> To prevent EXACTLY the shit show we are seeing now?  Or maybe Adam could try not to be an instigator? His frustrations and the other teammates are more than understandable even Upset recognises that hed be fine with having players/orgs not playing with him because of this situation but just speculating and sending hate which Adam KNEW would happen is extremely out of line?! How can you not see that?  Upset wanted to tell Hyli because he trusted him he told Yamato because hes the coach and he trusted him. Again taking DLs analogy if the captain explains you that one of the crew members had to leave because of an urgent family matter you have to trust the captain.  Adam coming out and saying that Upset left because his wife felt lonely is ridiculous who even believes that someone who worked for 5 years to get to worlds would just leave for some stupid reason? Do you think this worlds was more important to Adam who came from EUM just this year than to Upset whos been grinding hard for years and years?  [This](https://youtu.be/jJQqz80qF2w?t=1269) is a 2-3 minute interview with yamato from their worlds video please tell me what about it tells you that Upsets family emergency was something small

hm9dfn1,Opening_Exit_2094,11/27/2021,1,14.0,Dude the enemy team was disengaging. Didnt u just see how vex’s combo was enough to bring kayle azir to low health.   If I were a fed vex that knows her damage and then saw voli bring the fight to a squishy kayle and azir in a choker point I will go in. It’s a misposition and they deserved to be punished. It’s not like they have anything to cancel my combo cus rakan obviously mispositioned too.  The risk is not too high. Youre just playing safe :)
hmab6y9,sieer,11/27/2021,1,101.0,This dota 2 had custom maps for a long time and it doesn’t ruin the competitive part of the game so they could definitely made it work as something for rp and I’m guessing a lot of people would gladly spend 1350-1700 rp to have a custom map.

hmbpp9h,PixiCode,11/27/2021,1,3.0,Yes but that doesnt really answer the question that this is ultimately asking where did the idea/inspiration come from to make Jhin specifically obsess with the number 4?  Probably not this but thats ultimately what its asking.

hmb2f6g,Angry---train,11/27/2021,1,206.0,Getting in 6 autos as a melee champion with the enormous amount ot CC chainsways to kite back and mobility bonuses is extremely hard indeed. Conqueror itself takes an year to stack and that works on abilities and auto attacks
hmb9073,00Dandy,11/27/2021,1,38.0,Sure thats why I said >online< game.   &#x200B  >you can play it all the time and it never gets old because there is no story finale or max level.   >   > its a game everybody can play. Its F2P and even runs on shitty notebooks.  These things apply to MANY games yet LoL seems  to be the clear number 1 in terms of playerbase and overall interest like esports viewership for example. Even though LoL has been released in 2009.
hm9h3sl,SuperSucc69,11/27/2021,1,5.0,Since the last one dropped on October 28th this one will drop around that time aswell. Some people really have no chill huh
hmbpt95,ilovefishs911,11/27/2021,1,326.0,I ignored it because it just boiled down to “they do a lot of dps and have double crit” like no shit they’re melee adcs. He included yasuo in his rant despite the fact that he’s performing terribly. Remember that yasuo and yone ARE adcs.

hmbak89,Sooap,11/27/2021,1,40.0,You think? After killing so many people hed base and spend the gold. By the time anything happens again the ult is going to be back up especially since he went out of his way to buy Axiom Arc of all things. And again killing with the ult grants so much free gold that its kind of dumb to not do it.

hm9l32m,DarkBowls,11/27/2021,1,47.0,completely agree this and the winter skin-lines really make me nostalgic for old league its things like this that slowly suck the soul out of games people that dont care about the community anymore are developing this game and making important decisions.

hmbmh58,MsKokomi,11/27/2021,1,16.0,Oh i do agree it has always been horrible but it seems to now be even more prevalent now than ever before
hmbpre9,Love--Yours,11/27/2021,1,4.0,Well I can’t speak for everyone other than Riot kinda made flex into what it is that way. Personally normal blind & draft are just too easy with the skill disparity. If I want something with a serious tone but not really I will pay ranked flex. It’s probably a lot worse right now because it’s preseason and the state of the world. Also a higher probability of trolling because premades.
hma674q,supapumped,11/27/2021,1,2.0,I understand it can be frustrating but read back the last part of what you said. “They seem to enjoy it dying over and over and seeing people rage” If they are doing it for the sole purpose of making somebody rage and you rage at them then your giving them exactly what they want. Gotta starve the trolls of attention or else they will keep going back to get their “fix”.   On the flip side if they are just having a bad game and you flame them then more than likely they won’t start playing any better because you yell at them. Higher chance they just start raging back and what focus they did have for the game shifts to arguing with you making them play worse.  Either way your best course of action is to just mute them and if you really feel like you have to say something type it in the post game chat and then move on with your life.  Good luck!

hm92xx2,Musashis_Balls,11/27/2021,1,,Hmm I don’t know if I agree with you on the team fight thing  when the kill count in dota is much higher. I’ve always felt like too much was riding in team fights in league because when I watch worlds it seems like they do everything they can too avoid it. It feels like they are always on edge because they know that one bad fight can lose them the game whereas dota encourages you to fight by giving you cushions like farming jungle or buy back or whatever.
hm900c6,macrotransactions,11/27/2021,1,31.0,she was already broken all s11 camping at 52+ % winrate but low elo cant handle her so she didnt get gutted sadly

hmay770,100WattCrusader,11/27/2021,1,65.0,Everyone trying to justify that it’s suppose to win game is ignoring the point of the post.   Yes souls are suppose to help win you games but not auto win and not be entirely unfun as well.   Statistically this soul is far overpowered. 3% above the second best and 5% above the third best. It does need a cooldown or a nerf. Hell all the old souls have had cooldowns essentially so that makes the most sense really.
hmb1ylh,baked_tea,11/27/2021,1,28.0,Wait really? /s  Point of this video (besides showing off somewhat penta) is that I missed R on taric yet I had it ready again 3 sec later
hmbg6wa,Professor-Internet,11/27/2021,1,3.0,Kha’zix is a bug that makes my experience unplayable and he’s been there for years. They should do something about it.
hmavrty,Jailwhale,11/27/2021,1,170.0,To be fair Melee bruisers really needed the AS AS options for bruisers and melee fighters are really bad. espicially since they removed the 50% AS mythic passive from trinity..........  and there are a LOT of bruisers that primarily DPS through auto with abilities for bursting.  Riot is on record stating they hate the ADC role with a passion so the gutting for ranged champs is not a surprise
hmbpfwh,qwertyqzsw,11/27/2021,1,374.0,Hes also streaming has abysmal mechanics for his rank and will play for hours on end chain queueing while tilted (which happens easily).  Youre also just as likely to coinflip a better team in any elo. It doesnt get more probable just because the players are better lol its relative.
hma7fdc,SaulJoker,11/27/2021,1,76.0,I mean I myself think that most people don’t build these item combinations which is why I think it’s underappreciated/could work better than what most people are doing.  It’s entirely possible that I’m wrong and that death’s dance/chempunk aren’t worth building but I do think they are. I think Darius Sett and Illaoi could make really good use of those items in fact I don’t see why you would ever go Thornmail over Chempunk on Darius.

hmanjmg,SP3EDI,11/27/2021,1,,you are writing a fanfic about the Team romance Its not something your team needs to know because it not involves someone on the team or someone that works for the org. For such cases are subs on the worlds rules. Hily took it like this not because he was closer to upset then the other 3. Hily was basically bff with Bwipo and was still on upsets side.
hm91bfy,MyboiHarambe99,11/27/2021,1,4.0,Shen and zed would be a good one
hmbmiox,ArchdevilTeemo,11/27/2021,1,,**Do you have rankings for clearly number 1 in terms of playerbase?** I have the suspicion that quite a few mobile games are very popular because they are also very accessible.  And yes they have the biggest esport scene only csgo comes close. This is based on the big playerbase + that it is enjoyable to watch. SC2 for example is also great to watch but they dont patch enough (which means there will be a lot of similar games) & have a small playerbase so the esport scene is quite small.  And there is one of the biggest reasons LoL is so big compared to other games they patch so much that the game always feels fresh and while they often soft break the game these phases dont last that long. Most other games only patch once every few month.  It is possible to perfectly balance lol and give every champion a role in that they shine but this would require to stop adding new content and those radical patches. The problem is LoL would no longer get new patches at some point because otherwise it would unbalance the game.  To me LoL is the perfect side or backup game because you can always play it when you dont have a better game to play.
hm9nb80,Sktwin2k15,11/27/2021,1,11.0,Thank you. I might try this some day but first I need gear and also Im wondering about my Time management. Because I know I cant stream a lot / daily. But if Im not aiming high with this one then it doesnt matter and is not a problem. Have to think about this.
hmalkso,Dawegar,11/27/2021,1,,Blitz is the perfect example. You start playing you think the hook is always up then you realise if they miss he is a walking target for over 10 seconds. Then you learn the hand the hook comes from and it blows your mind.  (This never worked with Thresh for me I can’t do what a good thresh can do so still think he is unbeatable lol lucky I play top)

Yone Yasuo Q decreasing to 2s CD on lvl 1 yikesss

hmayw7e,LoLrovex,11/27/2021,1,341.0,I think the most important thing about midlane was finding out how your role interacts with jungle. Mid should always be ready to play with jungle and help sidelanes while pulling the enemy jungle and support into your lane. Most of the champions I would play against were just highlight reel champs like yasuo zed etc

hmajrju,Gerblinoe,11/27/2021,1,376.0,If one of my parents were on their deathbed I would spend as much time with them as possible. Not playing ARAM lol.  Tonight on things you may not know if you never had a medical emergency:  Hospitals hospices and all that have visiting hours they arent open to guests 24/7   ICUs may not have visiting hours at all or they have very short ones   Due to pandemic a lot of hospitals currently dont do visiting hours at all or have reduced them significantly  Due to all that you can have a lot time on your hands as your loved ones are dying
hmbozno,SadNid,11/27/2021,1,16.0,I have seen a few bots in bots lol ( usually Sorakas )  Yet even when I int in ARAMs everyone is usually supportive if they can tell youre trying  Its hard to int in bot games.. not sure why it would ever be a problem
hmbmnb3,OzoneGh141,11/27/2021,1,19.0,Maybe yasuo shouldnt have gone 0/10
hmbdofi,stormtrooper500,11/27/2021,1,,Well you should. There are quite a lot of similarities between high performance athletes and esports especially on the mental side.
hma33xg,minesaka,11/27/2021,1,372.0,And they dont even try. Half-assing because others did it first. What is the point Im probably too old to ever understand. One day her kids will fart sync to other people and she will be just as confused as I am now.

hmbgoqu,mivaad,11/27/2021,1,11.0,they have all that and they are still worse than long range mages adcs and tanks xd
hmbks4z,masterluke05,11/27/2021,1,,What a disingenuous response. Serpents Fang gives 2 more Lethality (barely anything) while having no Ability Haste and a situational boost against shields. Edge of Night admittedly gives a substantial boost in AD because Pyke passive converts HP to AD but also lacks any Ability Haste. Building the Collector is troll on Pyke because you already have an execute making its passive redundant even though it also has 2 more lethality and crit. Youmuus is the only other available non-mythic lethality item that would maybe make a difference in this situation with its extra 8 lethality and MS passive but still would likely underperform Axiom here as I doubt the small increase in damage/MS would allow Pyke to successfully execute Taric with the initial ult reset. I really feel like the substantial amount of bonus gold generated by Pyke ult is being underestimated here.
hmbn38e,Thundergod17,11/27/2021,1,588.0,OP isnt the person in the video. They are an account karma farming. Check pinned post
hm9mkhj,Ronizu,11/27/2021,1,,Collector deals 5% max HP (at maximum assuming that the damage you took put you at perfectly 5% hp). I dont know which champions you play but I at least dont play champions that have 40000 max HP (the amount required for 5% to be 2000 true damage).
hmbpk4j,Araeza,11/27/2021,1,86.0,I really don’t get the people insisting that Arcane “broke canon”.   As far as I’m concerned it’s the definitive version of events and if anything was “broken” it probably wasn’t very well thought out to begin with.   League lore before a couple years ago is honestly unimportant and it literally does not matter at all if something from an old champ bio or article on their fan fiction site conflicts with what something like Arcane Ruined King or even LoR sets up because in my book those take precedence over any other sources of lore until the MMO comes out.
hmaj9oo,PixiCode,11/27/2021,1,66.0,LoLs lore is weird.  I dont disagree that its flimsy but its not flimsy in that its... bad or uninteresting. Its just all over the place.
hmb3xqd,afito,11/27/2021,1,91.0,Because it gives you extra damage against people with more hp?`  Other drakes give stats that are absolutely better or worse depending on your role but chemtech gives a ton for carries and by design intentionally puts tanks at a huge disadvantage. Like with infernal you can say carries gain a lot but tanks gain very little fair but in this case tanks gain nothing except getting shredded a whole lot faster.
hma9l0h,FluckyVer,11/27/2021,1,83.0,Tristana can abuse it quite a bit.  Besides you Literally listed 70% of the Adcs that want to build AS. Since not all do.  So its pretty decent

hmbgazn,Artura_Dawn,11/27/2021,1,633.0,Does anyone know if the Prestige Points Shop will open before the expire date of the Prestige Points in January? I remember in 2019 you could use them to buy loot boxes and the like.

hmacjt7,Random_Stealth_Ward,11/27/2021,1,57.0,No no thats a misconception created due to People in this sub basically doing a telephone game of slowly twisting the first message.   The event is canon and there is an overall narrative that the event followed e.g. traveling and forming a group of sentinels recruiting the sentinel team in regions Viego taking the shards of isolde etc.  Rookie is at least last a rioter that talked about it and I saw it canon.  What isnt canon is the way its shown (as in the interactions and stuff) partly because there were a few different interpretations between versions and the event is intended as light hearted (for some reason). So for example Rengar likely wasnt a third person talker that randomly dropped the act after finding the letter I Diana Probably wasnt a deadweight who was just there taking space hopefully Olaf wasnt really calmed down because Rookie invoked talk-no-jutsu etc.
hmbq6te,Delt4Zer0,11/27/2021,1,25.0,You cant damage the enemy and he chases his own team so at the end of surpress he is with his team

hmbpfse,rmbar19,11/27/2021,1,225.0,So an indie developer can do it on their own in a couple of weeks but a game with one of the largest if not THE largest playerbase with plenty of money rolling in cant manage it?  &#x200B  Bullshit.
hmb48ee,WrathB,11/27/2021,1,137.0,Youre messing up 2019 with 2020 Nemesis was their best player in 2019 tbf he was really good that Worlds. Fnatic on the other hand mostly diffed enemy bots in 2020
hm99gd2,musashihokusai,11/27/2021,1,31.0,Very high ceiling on this team. Hope this roster stays together for more than a year.
hm9d3bq,ElBigDicko,11/27/2021,1,359.0,Something has to be done. EUNE is just horrible server because anyone who is good goes to EUW. This leads to EUNE top players bring avg masters players and generally server is just bad.
hmb90sp,PixiCode,11/27/2021,1,52.0,world runes were WMDs which caused massive sweeping cultural shifts on the entirety of the planet due to the mass devastation caused by them. Humans migrated as refugees to the continent Ionia is on creating the half-breed Vastayans we have now like Xayah + the nation of Ionia. Demacia was formed out of fear of mages that spawned due to the use and abuse of world runes. Entire regions were reshaped and forever changed due to this magic.  Runic magic =/= world runes though. Ryze uses ordinary runic magic and doesnt use the world runes just hides/safeguards them.

hm8zaoi,divonemanam,11/27/2021,1,59.0,nah prob just the toxic thick gass used in episode 7 or just toxic gas lol
hmawq3c,LeagueOfBlasians,11/27/2021,1,149.0,Can we stop with this Tencent/China bullshit.   Tencent is not involved in any Riot Games decisions nor would the Chinese playerbase hate a snow map.  Riot literally made Ultimate Spellbook this year which is free to play and costs more resources than painting a map white. They’ve also added the Arcane theme to turrets and minions.
hmagw1a,musiclover1c,11/27/2021,1,10.0,There are so many games where i am fed and lose because of inting teammate. Outclass out skill whatever. They just keep repeating it non stop death after death. My mental literally boom. And its so frequent in gold elo. I crush enemy mid lane got fed. i spam farm. Teammate no farm  bot dies 12 time combine feeds enemy. Enemy snowball. Jungle no gank at all afk farm for 20 min . 0 ojective. Keep invading enemy jungle and dies. All of these type of stuff makes me angry.   &#x200B  Or some games if they never die Its 100% winnable all they need to do is dont die. I cant take it anymore. Its torturing. Btw i am solo que no duo. All i meet the people and friendlist all is platinium and above to challenger. Only a few gold elo that acutally good players stuck because of inting teamates. but than they already gave up on rank. Just reach gold and get the skin they already tired and facing same situation as me.
hmadw0q,baburu12,11/27/2021,1,310.0,pretending upset isnt french lol

hmadsgt,NeekoBestTomato,11/27/2021,1,310.0,> Do you really think it was like that?  Mate if he is still all this time later so utterly distraught that he cant even think straight enough to send a DM to his fucking teammate....  Then what the FUCK are you doing not only being signed to play next season but being a core and integral part of the entire teams blow and and rebuild?  If its that serious - get the fuck out.   If its not - which clearly after a reasonable amount of time it was NOT and no he wouldnt just be chillin in arams and scrolling through twitter if it was then fucking talk to the people who are getting their careers dicked on stage thanks to you.  All this just points to an inability on Upsets part to view himself as anything other than a victim. Which is not new btw
hmbk1al,wootduhfarg,11/27/2021,1,174.0,I mean we also got similiar stuff in the West.  T1 fans against LS and his granny or   French fans against Upset.
hma01p2,LouiePyrex,11/27/2021,1,275.0,I’m a low elo support player that doesn’t care about climbing (in fact I don’t play ranked). I do have a nice winrate I play like a game or two a day with my gf but we started a losing streak. Can you give me some advice as a support?
hmagmun,xBlackLinkin,11/27/2021,1,20.0,No pen stops at 0. Only reduction goes further but considering reduction always gets applied first it will rarely happen outside of Trundle&Sej like interactions
hm9fw7c,Althalus-,11/27/2021,1,247.0,Maybe so but you did remind me to go rewatch that video partly for the nostalgia of how ugly old league was but also just for the running commentary of ‘aggressively walking towards the enemy’ lol.   Thing is with Evenshroud Leona is fucking terrifying right now. Much scarier than the adc….for at least 10-12 minutes.
hm9dofw,ranolia,11/27/2021,1,46.0,No... In terms of esports in general they had idea about korean scene but the popularitt that faker brought in wqs never seen before
hmbnf99,mrslakes,11/27/2021,1,156.0,Like I said I have nothing against him at all. I just find his fan base to be insufferable. But I guess that’s to be expected whenever you have a large fan base of anything really.
hmbqr2l,amd098,11/27/2021,1,156.0,actually its yuumi but shes attached to the yasuo that is afk after feeding but moves just a lil bit to avoid leaverbuster.
hmbg0gc,Totalwierddude,11/27/2021,1,39.0,I do get your points and although I am someone who usually can have my suspension of disbelief broken kinda easily if somethings off it almost never was with the arcane series.      I will admit though that although the imagine dragons song did fit the scene (not a fan of them btw) having them appear where a band materialised to play the song was a bit too much.  That is the one scene in the show that felt like a shameless plug more than a narrative decision.     I felt most the song choices were very specifically tuned to try get the audience to feel certain emotions and for the most part I believe it worked. I wasnt a fan of every song but they never pulled me out the experience of watching the show.  &#x200B  I actually also liked the Sting song at the end. I will however admit it would have been nice to just have had some normal osts to listen to but I dont think the series suffered by not having them.

hm95zck,dodgers23,11/27/2021,1,42.0,I saw you asking about a Vi tip so because I love Vi and main her after q you will have time to auto attack a target that you hit. Your q applies Vis w passive and your auto attack after your q stacks the w passive again. You use VIs e to reset her auto attack stack your 3rd w and then your next auto will proc the w armor shred. Master the timing and you can almost always get it
hmb1czb,stuffslols,11/27/2021,1,12.0,As you get a bit more experience in watching your team and their habits youll start to learn a bit more about which objectives will need help but its mostly a thing that just takes learning and practice no real shortcuts to figuring it out unfortunately.   Its why I quit being a top laner. I can understand the appeal of playing on an island but being forced to watch my team without being able to contribute just wasnt for me.
hmangv5,Fgame,11/27/2021,1,392.0,Because he still has a fucking job? If he didnt have a good reason the org is just gonna say nah no big deal SURELY we can rely on you next year?  Go away the grownups are trying to have a conversation.
hm95zoe,BigFeeder,11/27/2021,1,66.0,my point was about a normal game and you still mention solo q. league doesnt force you to be toxic toxic players just need an excuse to justify their shitty attitude in games.

hmafvs4,Frakcherd,11/27/2021,1,1845.0,Its not hard to dodge a punch when youre concentrating on the person in front of you. Also a lot of his blocks and dodges were him just interposing the shaft of the hammer between himself and the Chemtanks which is an intuitive method of blocking with a large weapon.
hmb9bzc,DiceUwU_,11/27/2021,1,125.0,Man that isnt such a bad idea. Reviving after death is such a gane ending mechanic that it could definitely be granted by elder. Maybe go full dota 2 and have it be a one time thing until the second elder spawns.
hm8upyl,KnitCat99,11/27/2021,1,115.0,Nice for BDS.
hm8yhs7,BBQMasterDad,11/27/2021,1,13.0,It’s an 500 gold swing per major objective for a team. You realize that’s a rather large gold sum correct? Faker was down 1k gold his personal lane all through Worlds yet by playing objectively for his teammates he granted +1.8k on average total global gold for his team. You must not understand the importance of global economy.
hmbfc3v,HazelCheese,11/27/2021,1,52.0,Its just a colloquial from of could have.

You know that Adam is working and staying in Germany to play LEC. In Germany this is against the Law and if upset wanted to he can Adam in real trouble ? Dunno if there are such laws in France but in Germany if you talk shit on the internet you can be held accountable for what you post in the internet especially if you are attacking other people with false claims hatespeech and so on.

hm9o4to,nyasiaa,11/27/2021,1,200.0,just taking an objective isnt really that useful because it really depends on all the timings and most of the time I *dont* want to take the tower too early because it just gives me no option to fast shove the wave and have it bounce back (which in turn makes geting frozen on a basically unfixable problem)  I cant take herald on my own and I *dont* even know what to do with the knowledge. I *know* have to look further into the future but its just too hard. Yes lee sin showed bot. Do I try to slow push now? Do I try to shove it super fast? At what time will the wave bounce back to me? At what time will the slow-push build and crash? I dont know any of these timings which combined with not knowing lee sins timings is basically as good as if I didnt know anything and all that is even excluding the fact that theres an opponent in my lane I have to take into account.  Things such as taking plates when I can are kinda obvious but often it turns out that this lee sin or whoever has taken a direct path from bot to top with no stops in between and arrived top lane before I recalled from taking all the plates and I die. Or a slow-push builds and lee and their top lane use the huge wave to dive me. None of these are gold level knowledge I didnt even use minimap while breezing through gold so I dont really believe people can do all that in there (otherwise I would be hard punished for my terrible decisions) in fact from my experience I doubt even anyone below high diamond starts doing these things correctly.

hmaphfm,SP3EDI,11/27/2021,1,392.0,there is no need to blame anyone. Adam wanted to be malicious online in social media knowing he had the french fanbase to back him up. He tried to make it a top 10 anime betrayal post when it was not even upset that wanted him or nisqy to be gone. it was management that wanted to upgrade and replace him.  going online and trowing hate at other people especially in such a situation is more then disgusting from adam and his french fanbase.
hmbfwz0,bupropiom,11/27/2021,1,36.0,Ranged tops Jax is difficult because of counterstrike countering stuns Shen early is very difficult because hes high damage and blocks my stuns.
hmb4y8r,gabu87,11/27/2021,1,147.0,First of all youre overreacting he didnt get sent off to pick cotton. He was earning millions playing league.  Secondly you dont feel like he has any responsibility signing on to a roster he didnt gel with?  When youre old enough to get a job you will see the same thing happen in difference workplaces.

hmbd244,tanezuki,11/27/2021,1,91.0,>But then you get melted by % hp damage right? Because you’re stacking health? Sure you can argue you’d take less % physical damage but that doesn’t stop % hp magic damage (cough Liandry’s cough Demonic).  The thing is AP machine guns like Cass or Ryze are way less common as archetypes in AP champions rather than AD champions who have marksmen whos whole class is made for this. And even then I will build MR items just later down the line.  Obviously against direct AP match ups I will go MR items like Spirit Visage or other MR tank items depending on what I need but all those items have their passive working on everyone so that wasnt my focus here.  I play Nasus and Sett more than Cho the flair is just a meme. Nasus Sett Cho being my mains top even though the rest of my champions are on other lanes (Lux main aswell but not top obv).  For Darius ok I dont play him. I dont see that item picked often though and people definetely pick Darius often when I pick Nasus (Camille being a must ban atm).

hmacy3x,Suspicious-Bus6351,11/27/2021,1,52.0,Nuguri never had this problem on Damwon. I think realistically there might be more to this situation than Tian and Doinb revealed in that documentary. I would like to hear Nuguri’s side of the story.

hm9gc6s,Prestonwww,11/27/2021,1,17.0,Im sorry that was your first experience with the game. Thats why I would always recommend every brand new player to play at least a couple AI games before jumping into PVP. Yes the AI games suck ass. You really wont learn much aside from the basics. But considering I jumped into the game playing sivir mid duo playing a couple AI games certainly would have benefitted me very much had I known. The important thing is that you tried to make people happy and personally I was never happy in any role. I just focused too much on my teammates faults and could never improve upon my own because of that     Im glad that you eventually found a group that you worked well with. And I agree once you find that one group everything just works. But they are so few and far between that more often than not you just get the same level of tilt if not more than usual.

hm9lbya,TeeTheSame,11/27/2021,1,20.0,The range is super broken. Yeah the AS is pretty weak but getting 100 range is so massive.   But yeah I agree. The rune is even more powerful on melees who get significant bonus range AND tons of AS.

hmaj7l4,Overmaan,11/27/2021,1,79.0,Tian seems to be a very decent guy. Almost every player who has played with him does nothing but praise him. Even though Tian should have had some difficulties especially this year.  Hope Tian to be healthier and show outplays as he used to do.

hm8xoja,JujyPop,11/27/2021,1,9.0,spica and tactical are so fun together
hma5dqo,catseye013,11/27/2021,1,29.0,None of this is true. Competitive gaming isn’t a job. Players and teams may have expectations on Nuguri but unless his contract specifies he needs to actively engage and communicate with his teammates (which literally no contract does say) his job is simply to play league of legends for FPX which he did.  This is always going to be the danger in throwing millions on players to make them join you entirely for a paycheck. We saw the same thing with SwordArt Perkz and Alphari in NA this year. Like 15 million dollars down the drain for almost no results at all.  If Nuguri logged out mentally because he cared about nothing but the money I agree that’s a shitty mindset and a bad attitude for him. But it was never his job to communicate or act a certain way he was just paid money to play in the LPL for FPX which he did.
hm9zk5z,AliasTcherki,11/27/2021,1,25.0,Honestly I think that it would be best if everyone just agreed to disagree.   Some people (Im part of those) think that Upset is in his right to not share what happened: he shared that something was going on that it deeply affected him and that he needed to take care of his loved ones. Unlike what Doublelift says a team is not a brotherhood. Reaching that state is extraordinary for the very reason that its rare. Making so that you have both a super good team with excellent players and that those players all match together on a personnal / intimate level happens super rarely. Therefore its understandable that Upset doesnt want to go further in details to his other teammates.   On the other hand some people (like DL) think that being in a professional team whos number one priority is winning Worlds goes over that. That you need to at least partially give up on that right and submit to the judgement of your teammates to whether or not it was a good enough reason (honestly I really disagree with that but I seriously understand where it could come from considering the stakes that are at hands here).      Yet there is one thing above all of this which is to go public in a TL. And on that point I stricly disagree. You dont go public on such things and start a wave of hate on a former teammate (and Im not saying that Adam did it on purpose but thats still his responsability)

hm918lj,a_fucking_kiska,11/27/2021,1,485.0,mechanically a lot more skillshots game is based around teamfights when dota is more about tactics and thinking. Also league hero abilities are a lot less impactful in comparison to dota. One smart dota aoe initiation and 4v5 is won. lol lacks that. by so it means that a teamfight is won by coordination of all team. in dota one player can win the game in lol you cant. I like dota more.
hmbas2a,vooffle,11/27/2021,1,196.0,They qualify quite a while as since the map update which is incorrect. And I cant read...
hmb2eml,MushyRedMushroom,11/27/2021,1,91.0,Why are the new dragon souls just blatant power creep upgrades? I don’t want to ever see the old maps or souls at all because they blow ass compared to the broken new ones. If I get in a game and I keep good dragon control as a jungle and get a new soul I feel like I instant win and if it’s an old soul I feel like it’s worthless.
hm9vhug,paradiselater,11/27/2021,1,269.0,Congrats not just in game but juggling everything youre doing. Hope next run works out.  I am curious about your jungling experience. Any particular reason you settled on kayn as your pick? Im basically a rammus one trick pony but his lack of ability to secure objectives and fight on his own is frustrating so Im looking around to learn something different.  Interestingly Kayn matchup as rammus is hard so I recognize he can be strong. However his stats put Kayn in the middle of the pack for junglers. What are some things you think would be important to master on him? Red or blue or do you stick to the red if 3 melee blue if 3 ranged?  Thanks
hmauh35,Axo-Army,11/27/2021,1,10.0,Thank you so much!

hmbr8yt,Rip_ManaPot,11/27/2021,1,326.0,Reduce max attack speed for melee increase max attack speed for ranged. Decrease the attack range you get. And make the amount of attack speed you get scale with level so you cant abuse it level one. Fixed.
hma7nn5,Vaiylie,11/27/2021,1,29.0,Ya if my mid laner built abyssal mask on malz and picked galio I too would do a nuguri cosplay.

hmbr652,TTVBasedJafar,11/27/2021,1,17.0,ADCs can play every single lane but jungle thanks to cringebow.  AP champions can also play every single lane thanks to just general overpowered itemization  Tanks cant play top anymore unless theyre tahm kench or mundo and theyre forced to be supports that still get outdone by enchanters or pyke
hm9f9le,RegalSkye,11/27/2021,1,31.0,Arcane disregards established canon too that isnt the problem at all since LoLs lore is largely very flimsy. The problem was that SoL sucked.

hm9wsix,yp261,11/27/2021,1,425.0,„most people have multiple smurfs” source: trust me bro  you underestimate the amount of casual players who dont give a shit about anything you are saying. n  we are playing for 8+ we were kicked from EUW when they removed our currency from the store and gave us a free transfer. we don’t have smurfs cause we are too old for this shit and we have no time for it.
hm9ig1o,FabioSxO,11/27/2021,1,252.0,I am master and Ive played most roles as well I understand that you might think that jungle is the easiest because of how hard it can carry when fed but support is no way easier than jungle or mid or top or adc. Theres no fucking way. You are simply not used to how support is played because it can not just right click and oneshot like other roles would. About Top yes when I smurf I find it harder to carry on Top even if its my main role and thats why I prefer playing other roles.  Top>Ad>Mid>Jg/Support  This tier list is only correct from a smurfing standpoint. How much impact can X role have when 1v9ing every game. Same as yours but without support being the hardest because it simply isnt and is only different from what youre used to.

hm9w9yv,fojek17,11/27/2021,1,1.0,If you build Axiom on Karthus you are straight up trolling. You invest 3k gold into an item that gives you no stats outside of small amount of ability haste. It is not worth to purchase it ever on this champ even considering the ult cd refund.  Chemtech drake:  A soul is suppoused to be superstrong. You need 20+ minutes to get enough drakes to get it. Would you rather have another cloud soul?  On another hand I will say that chemtech rift with camuflage zones is one of the worst changes Ive seen in the game. Each SR rift game for me is praying that the rift wont turn to chemtech.  First strike - huge cd on that rune and it goes on cd whenever you get hit by a champ. Pretty simple to play around this rune. The only people who can actually use it are ranged champs which get 70% of its effectiveness.
hm991t8,pelacur,11/27/2021,1,129.0,DK top still ?? Zeus while he was decent didnt exactly tear opponent left and right. I will give slight advantage to Doran and Peanut.

hm9r7xm,tanezuki,11/27/2021,1,60.0,Yeah they made this because range is a primary characteristic that can greatly modify how efficient an item can be when used by those ranged champions.  Juggernauts arent ranged champions afaik. Fimbulwinter specifically adresses that CC issue by having it being slows on melee champions.
hmayd1t,Baazz_UK,11/27/2021,1,170.0,I agree with you Yasuo still gets some value out of Conqueror in some matchups over Lethal Tempo but Yone becomes completely unstoppable with it no case that Conq is better for him.

hmb9p8b,Gerblinoe,11/27/2021,1,,>Because if its something series whats the harm in letting your teamates know? There is literally no harm in that then they would understand and support him.  I dont know Adam or Bwipo or Hyli or Upset personally so I cant say if they would understand or support him. Do you know any of them?    Upset who does know them personally decided that some of them arent trustworthy enough and I cant argue with that because again I have never spoken to any of these dudes     And again you dont know what happened. All of these points can for example point to his wife suffering from depression but also a difficult pregnancy ending in a miscarriage or somebody from her family dying after a longer sickness.   All od which are valid reasons why Upset would choose being with her over worlds      As for Adam saying she just felt lonely Upset called that a lie. Why would I trust Adam over Upset?     Also the fact that you just bring it down to his wifes  feelings shows you just dont have a life experience and/or empathy to get why would her being severly depressed be enough of a reason to go back   Like I said I hope you just mature one day rather than learn from your own experience

hmaz9zs,YoungAnimater35,11/27/2021,1,12.0,Thank you thats what I was thinking. Soul is a good reason to leave I guess if my team cant follow up then its a lost game no matter how many objectives I think will be beneficial in taking.

hm9cfd7,WintersEnvoy,11/27/2021,1,4.0,Hes super all in practically a melee mage. Like with most melees you play around his lack of range and CC/target him down. No special trick if you get 4 man Rd you try to not scatter in a way where he hits all 4 with his E since he will pool to get it off if he isnt pooled you stun and run he usually plays for flanks because there should be no way he does this walking into your team since his playstyles so obvious and lacks (to an extent) versatility adcs are doomed vs even an inting vlad so theyre gonna insta run if they get ulted because theyll die to his combo without tons of MR.   I guess certain slow champs also counter him more than usual since he can only (pre?)pool and rocketbelt a short distance but yes very all in kit at short range but also low cooldowns so you cant let this guy sit around because hes gonna hit hard and heal a lot in a fight he isnt insta targeted as if he was kogmaw. He is the primary target unless you completely sack your backline (I guess that can be fine sometimes bruisers probably beat him) but since his range is so short he generally cant play a more hit and run style like other mages

Dota 2 have different servers too but no region lock so you can play on whatever server you want and as a result both NA and EU are fucking horrifying every other game is 4 peruvians or 4 russians on your team screaming in their own language and communication is basically 0 people think its just gonna be oh I can play with my friend who goes on a different server more are in for a rude awakening if this actually happens.

Viper in EDG had not only Meiko making a big effort but he had Scout whos also outgoing and helped Viper adjust to life in China EDG in general made an effort to help Viper outside of the game. FPX was 100% focused on the game and didnt know (or try hard) to help Nuguri with him being homesick and feeling isolated.
hma1h4i,StarEaterShaddai,11/27/2021,1,431.0,My own experience playing between low silver and low diamond on both servers is that on EUNE there are a lot more clueless people in lower ranks meaning that they cant CS properly jungle randomly have little to no macro sense which only gets better around platinum while EUW low ranked people would usually show some practice like having a stable CS doing proper rotations around the map securing objectives but falling apart as soon as they cant follow a guide. What this implies to me is just that EUNE low ranks just have more organically bad players while EUWs low ranks have a lot of smurfs hardstucks and people carried by champs that fall apart as soon as they encounter a single opponent that knows how to counter them. Around plat they start feeling the same.     On the other note I think the honor system needs to be reworked into a proper behaviour matchmaking system rather than there being no shades between toxic players roaming free and being chat/temp banned. By toxic I include those that cant communicate. They should be separated from proper serious players either way no matter how mechanically skilled they are.
hma6w4v,kupukapow,11/27/2021,1,7.0,Thats not the proper way to snowball a lead through top lane. Sure it can work to roam around and help your team but ad a general rule of thumb top laners win the game by dominating lane and then just steamrolling their advantage. In top lane your goal is to get an advantage and then make it impossible for the enemy laner to face you until you can eventually 1v2. Then you want to draw the enemy jungler to your lane and kill them. From there you can win.  Obviously thats the ideal scenario but going into every game as a top laner youre going to want to press your advantage through sidelanes.

hmargm1,ozykingofkings11,11/27/2021,1,298.0,I love this answer because that’s how I think of it as an ADC I have 3 champs of those same different play styles (Kaisa Ashe Tristana). Out of curiosity how would you categorize the play styles of other roles? So I can select a small champion pool for them and branch out.

hma3tgo,Cahecher,11/27/2021,1,,Ironically TES won LPL by playing through 369s lane last year and then they started playing towards JL leaving top as the weakside. Basically when 369 got resources he looked really good but this year he wasnt getting much and looked terrible. Considering both 369 and JL are dirty inters when left to their own devices its hard to blame TES for their decision since there was no way this team could field both of them.  The point is that right now 369 is one of the players who can stand to the level of Breathe and Bin and while Zoom is better overall its not like 369 is washed or has no carry potential.

hm9aamr,magnetar2,11/27/2021,1,6.0,Youre right I didnt provide any context. This is what I sent to Riot: Three players in the enemy team were explicitly racist during an ARAM game. It started with player x (Olaf) using the N word in a disguised form to express in game frustration. I warned them in /all chat by stating Reported. Perhaps a bit childing of me but I wanted to know if it was intentional or not. x replied Snowflake. I admit I lost my temper and I dont mind taking accountability for bad language as long as they are held accountable for being openly racist in a multiplayer game. Then player y (Tristana) said (Olaf) wasnt racist by using the N word in reference to his opponents. At this point I was losing my temper because not only one person was openly racist but now two people were doing that so my language didnt get any better. Then player z (Twisted fate) threatened me to go to Belgium so he/she could change my mind about what was going on. At the end the enemy team won and x (Olaf) said Racism always wins.

hm9f1is,Dastu24,11/27/2021,1,13.0,But as you can see me playing and trying to improve got me stuck for several years the moment the player i played with often not even me had to get new acc we started to climb rapidly out of nowhere playing basically the same. (I still think that biggest problem being stuck in silver is 35% games you win 35% games you lose and 30% just somebody throwing/afk/trolling and so on only question is will you be on the lucky side)
hm9fbky,Dastu24,11/27/2021,1,13.0,This might have something to it my only problem with this is that i was stuck in silver battling silvers and low golds for a very long time with 53% winrate. The moment my friend got new acc and we played few games we got matched with plats and dia and our winrate scyrocketed - 65% (there were no more trolls afks and so on we had like on in 70 games before it was 1/5 games pretty stabily)  And all this because the new acc got high mmr so we would face better people (in the same flex elo)

hm9gj11,Ok_Illustrator3087,11/27/2021,1,,Sivir i kinda agree but kalista can never be good in soloq without being 100% banned in proplay. The only way to make her balanced is a rework. (Or at least change the fucking ult)
hm9stzu,swardeey,11/27/2021,1,175.0,Yea but if u scroll back 2 weeks u can see him being hatdstuck g4 with around silver 1/2 mmr. Its not like he randomly improved to plat level. It will help him early season but he will most likely have a hard time next season when he starts wary above his real skill level.
hmaii6v,Applepowdersnow,11/27/2021,1,3.0,depends if you wanna pay or not.   an EXP boost can help you lvl up faster so you get the BE faster.
hm9d26l,Kastamera,11/27/2021,1,158.0,>So they would have hit it but just didn’t play  Isnt not hitting a rank because people dont play enough the normal though?  I remember back in season 4 my diamond 2 friend told me that getting to diamond is really easy and anyone could do it if they played enough. At that point its just about putting in countless games and anyone can achieve diamond. So based on that people who arent diamond+ just dont play enough. And I agree with that my experience also supports that.  I never played much ranked (5-10% of games are ranked at max 70% are ARAM) but in season 9 when I thought Id give ranked a serious try I got from silver 2 to plat 4 in less than 80 games with a 65% win rate (so I couldve climbed further easily I was constantly getting matched with p1 players) when my previous peak was gold 4.  And in no way do I consider myself good. I know I suck at the game I know theres a lot of room for improvement but ultimately anyone can reach high ranks if they dont troll and play enough. If an ARAM main can do it anyone can.  >they give some excuse talking about ranked anxiety when really they just wanted attention lol  About ranked anxiety: Ive had that because in ranked games I literally cant even enjoy the game because the one thing that matters is the outcome. Thats why I main ARAM because there the outcome of the game doesnt matter its all for just fun no stress.I remember back when I was climbing in ranked I would only play if I felt like I was in perfect mental and physical condition. Only slept 7 hours at night? I wont be playing ranked today. Do I feel even slightly tired after my previous ranked game? Ill continue playing tomorrow. Is there something distracting me? No ranked until the distraction is gone. Did a teammate tilt me? Im done for today. Did I lose a game?I was genuinely so stressed about playing ranked that I would only play when I felt completely rested and I wouldnt play if I had even the smallest issue.  My point is: the they would have hit it they just didnt play enough applies to everyone below diamond who genuinely tries to win ranked games and climb.And ranked anxiety is a real thing. In my case it increased my win rate because I was only playing when I felt in top form but at the same time I didnt enjoy the ranked games because they were sweat fests and gave me the same feeling/stress as exams did back in University. I even felt bad after winning 2 games and losing 1 despite my LP gains being around 25-28 per game and the loss being between 13 and 15. I knew I was climbing but it still felt miserable to lose because I wasnt getting any enjoyment out of the games and it was only the negativity that really came through. Its the reason I havent played Summoners Rift this entire year and I only ever play ARAM. Its just pure gameplay with 0 pressure.  I know that vast majority of the playerbase prefers being competitive but I just thought Id show you the other side of the coin where some casual players actually struggle with ranked anxiety and perhaps its more stressful for them to play \~100 games than it is for the average player to play \~1000 games. Despite what you said pushing through ranked anxiety is also huge effort and you shouldnt attack/call out people for having anxiety about something.
hmak2vp,Enkenz,11/27/2021,1,79.0,Your last sentence pretty much resume nuguri.      He pretty much got the princess syndrome.     Won worlds with dwg thought he was bigger than the team and tried to prove it by joining lpl but in the end proved he wasnt failed miserably by not getting out of groups and his former teammates won lck twice went to finals at msi & worlds without him.      And even fpx spring form i would argue it was more about bo being that good.      Tried to ego check lck and lpl failed miserably
hm8wb5v,poroporotv,11/27/2021,1,12.0,I feel like a part of it has to do with Corejj being on his own team lol.

hm9l9om,EatAssAndFartFast,11/27/2021,1,35.0,Yeah same bro I remember playing 1.7.2 back then and I was amazed with how much change theyve done to the game so many new things and stuff are added.
hm9fjux,WallaSays3z,11/27/2021,1,161.0,That rule is a joke
hmarbiq,tanezuki,11/27/2021,1,85.0,>mortal reminder only applies the 60% if you hit them with the three autos.  Since midgame to lategame its still applied very fast. Unless the ADC is a Runaan user it will indeed be mono target.   But you usually dont care focusing down one target is more of a strategy than focusing multiple foes at once. Unless youre playing against a Soraka but she now cleanses GW with her ult so its irelevant.   And idk about the 50% threshold. Tanks may not be able to put them below it themselves but in a teamfight setting would it matter ? Their backline is supposedly dealing the needed damages.   The passive aspect I agree but then either slows makes it too strong or this would make it too passive.   Or put the slow but cap it with a cooldown ? Theres no easy answer I guess.
hm9babx,divonemanam,11/27/2021,1,18.0,I love the targon one
hmaamo1,Slygone,11/27/2021,1,313.0,People who said DL has no motivation or drive anymore need to be reminded of that fact. He found himself in one of the most dreadful situations in his life and went to win LCS finals while playing out of his mind.

hmb35q8,Ahri_Support_OTP,11/27/2021,1,7.0,I think its perfectly possible using the current tools as all you need to do is shift power away from the portion of a kit responsible for a hard-counter. An example: what makes Vayne and Fiora so painful for tanks and juggernauts and bruisers is their %hp true damage so a good solution would be (for Vayne) to reduce her W damage and increase her E damage/increase her E stun duration/increase her Qs dash length (so she lives up to her short-range kite ADC fantasy) or (for Fiora) to reduce her passives damage/Q attacks range but make her W %HP magic damage if she parries CC/enhance her E AS cripple if it hits a vital or in general.
hmb8yhd,SleepyLabrador,11/27/2021,1,10.0,> It just seems like people dont take ranked seriously in preseason and considering the fact that ranked in preseason does affect your MMR  You will have about 10 months to gain it back.  > it just seems like theres no upside.  It depends if youre one of those people like me who are spamming LT Yone or Crown & Fimbulwinter Kass youre gonna have fun. But other than that getting somewhat used to the new items can be helpful for next season.

hm9xnt2,Kroxxen1,11/27/2021,1,21.0,Maybe try playing a bit less than currently do but still play since it brings you joy! And if you need people to play with there are plenty of discord servers to find people to play that have decent community built I’m in one myself and most of time can find some to play with. Also in comp aspect tryout for a team if you wanna play competitive maybe be a sub or starter if you can. But don’t drop it

hm9g3fx,iMidg3t,11/27/2021,1,372.0,Which is why people went to EUW to ESCAPE THE SERVER.   So why do you think merging them would be a good idea?  there is a reason why good players go to EUW. It should stay that way.

hm9nyfo,KangarooChief,11/27/2021,1,3.0,Yeah its been done before but not with newer champs and I also included all of the shortcuts of the same length rather than just the first one
hm91tsl,DmonAbsoluTrEbON,11/27/2021,1,28.0,I do hope they can get 8th place atleast... This roster was made to develop so to say that they will actually prove anything is quite strange but I expect them to do their best regardless of their deficits.
hm9ma7r,Bluepanda800,11/27/2021,1,52.0,So its not Tencents fault but riot really should have taken the opportunity to make an ice dragon so we can have a winter map
hma83ig,1234123517,11/27/2021,1,11.0,you cant parry haymaker when you are stunned and it was near fully charged so the fiora probably panicked about it. she shouldnt have taken this fight at all bc its way too risky anyways
hm9fnen,Prestonwww,11/27/2021,1,17.0,In that case absolutely. Its not a problem if youre having fun. This is more targeted towards players who take the game more seriously. Regardless of if youre high elo or low elo the game is mentally draining and unless you have the mental foritude of a fucking rock or a brick wall it usually ends up making you feel awful. At least in my experience.
hma3kit,HoouueeaaH,11/27/2021,1,149.0,He think he said enough his teammates dont. we will most likely never know the truth. why should i believe Upset Adam or Bwipo who demonstrated himself how girls can fuck your brain (coach Lena) especially at young age.
hm9awfg,azersub,11/27/2021,1,359.0,I know they are but they still choose to use their main language to flame. Especially if there is 1 or 2 ppl that speak same language. But tbh that happens on euw as well with spanish ppl
hm9egdc,Ha_Ree,11/27/2021,1,77.0,I dont think or at least I hope the exclamation mark for being revealed by non-champions isnt a bug and is a new change to stealth because it can sometimes be hard to spot if you have been revealed or not by pinks and the exclamation mark is way visually clearer  Also the turret aggro reset has been in the game for months at least its happened to me in games for a long while
hmbkcrt,Dasdi96,11/27/2021,1,49.0,Except even in the mid game tanks get blown up in 3 seconds.

hma6nc3,fojek17,11/27/2021,1,47.0,No. Im saying that arguing over who is in the right whether to pass a surrender vote is lacking empathy.   You need at least 4 people to FF if it doesnt pass then just deal with it instead of making a post on reddit on how feeders should have no say in surrender vote.  Im a never FF guy and yes I might get angry at a surrender vote getting passed in a game that I felt was winnable but I respect the other 4 people who wanted to vote for yes and just move on with my life instead of creating posts online on why surrender vote should be removed from the game.

hmad1ig,Exclarius,11/27/2021,1,310.0,Reread my comment. If you can deal with stress/trauma in a way where you will always be of clear mind and will always make the most logical decisions then more power to you. But people deal with stress/grief in different ways. You cannot decide for someone how they should deal with it.  > big chillin with your wife grinding arams and soloque  Youre making this sound as if he was just playing for fun as if he want to his holiday home in the Bahamas. Do you really think it was like that?
hm9suy9,triple_u,11/27/2021,1,13.0,This is factually correct.
hm9zexg,delahunt,11/27/2021,1,12378.0,Watch the end of Episode 3 again then immediately cut to where the guns go off at the end of Episode 9.  They both end with Jinx pleading she is sorry after killing someone she didnt want/mean to kill. Only in that moment Silco doesnt toss Jinx away. He tells her she is perfect. He tells her not to apologize. He accepts her even as she killed him.  As Jinx then goes up with the SMDR she hears two lines from Silco. Well show them. We will show them all. This is exactly what Silco said to her as he held her sobbing at the end of episode 3.  That acceptance basically locked in Jinx. She tells Vi that too. She wanted Vi to love her like Vi did before episode 3 even though she is different. But Vi is a different person now too. Theyre both too different. They cant go back. And for Jinx to survive that means she has to go forward as Jinx the only way she knows how...with a bang.  Hence Heres to the new us.
hma05n5,delahunt,11/27/2021,1,12378.0,Youre aware one of Jinxs character inspirations is the Joker from batman right? She is an insane remorseless killer who murders people for fun and spectacle. Arcane is the story of how Jinx becomes Jinx.  She makes Jhins appreciation for art look reasonable by comparison.

To bring it in line it either needs a nerf of some sort or the other 5 souls need considerable buffs. One of them is easier than the other.
hm8xwrp,John_Jack_Reed,11/27/2021,1,27.0,You literally just wrote an essay about how its destroying the game youre the one whos mad here lol
hm9soii,quiteUnskilled,11/27/2021,1,131.0,Yea EU in general was strong that year (and KR was weak) but Fnatic went out in quarters that kinda killed their hype. And Fpx did not look as strong in groups they totally ramped up throughout playoffs so Fnatic losing to them in quarters felt a little bit underwhelming.  Also that Nemesis lineup felt a little bit one dimensional iirc mostly because Rekkles and Hyli were so insane that year that everything was about their botlane. G2 on the other hand had something magical about them in 2019 they played arguably the most entertaining and creative LoL of any pro team ever hard to compete with that.

hm9b9vt,AalfredWilibrordius,11/27/2021,1,42.0,Just accept that for a ton of champions tank item GW just sucks when you only have one ability to proc GW thats kinda bad but when its also a cc thats even worse because you dont really value GW while theyre cced because a lot of the healing can only be used while youre not cced. Unlucky time to not play an old champ because Riot doesnt like those and doesnt do anything about stupid issues that only old champs have to deal with.   Or in this instance beg your enchanter support or someone else to buy GW because they do have good items.

Now i know its a bug when it shows.   I never thought about sudden impact either i took it because the empowered e is a dash (i value e pretty highly even buying Lich Bane quite often) but now as you say it with the stealth thing...

hm9173v,PM_something_German,11/27/2021,1,328.0,Youre downvoted but youre right its statistically so damn unlikely that it couldnt have happened.  -  I assume he used a Cyrillic phone keyboard and in the first case he typed random letter and in the second case random letters again but pressed one of the suggested words.

hm95tys,bischof11,11/27/2021,1,29.0,  You have data for your claims?  Would be intresting to see how much more toxic the game becomes with people like you who drag out games just for the doctrin of never surrender.  Its obvious that people who want to have fun in a computer game also want to go next to get a new game and not being stuck in a lost onesided unfun stomp.
hm9985t,LakersLAQ,11/27/2021,1,30.0,He was playing those in-houses from Europe but he will be in LA for this tournament. I think he was coming either way for some TL event December 3rd.

hmagvwp,9percentmilk,11/27/2021,1,26.0,I keep chat on because it’s fun to interact with the other humans playing the game and extreme toxicity is way less prevalent than reddit likes to say it is. But it’s definitely not “useful” and if you’re trying to grind you should probably just turn it off. Learn things about the game from smart people on Youtube not from the scrubs in your game that are just as bad as you.

Farming was shit no team fights could ever happen cause I had 0 bushes to jump to engage/disengage.

hma172o,PlasticForkRubberDuc,11/27/2021,1,53.0,Yeah my jaw actually dropped when I read that. There is a *very* good reason that ADCs are the only class that didnt get any new items this preseason.

hm92565,Nyte_Crawler,11/27/2021,1,124.0,I cant really feel confident in rating a Peanut roster highly he is super streaky. Also Lehends is just ok he looked amazing when he was playing on that stacked Griffin Roster but more notably he was laning with Viper- since then hes been pretty average.  This roster will 100% be pushing top 3 but I cant see them taking first. With that in mind I wouldnt call it a super team.
hmac522,Assassin21BEKA,11/27/2021,1,450.0,But Tekken is a 3d fighting game. If anything it looks more like a street fighter mortal combat or guilty gear. And because it is a assist based fighting it is even more like marvel vs capcom. Your comment sounds like some troll comment made in order to get confused responses from other people.

hmab0bb,OilOfOlaz,11/27/2021,1,313.0,> However the usual jobs people have is not as emotional close with your colleagues as being a League pro player so Id imagine it is really hard having to build a sort of brotherhood to get on the same page get to know each other and trust and then somebody isnt trusting you (even with a family matter) also just moments before the biggest moment of the year for the players.  I kinda get your angle here but former players often described (old) SKT as a well oiled cold machine in game with ppl not being super close to eachother the same has for example been true for the real Madrid squad that won 3 CL in succession or the 90 Bulls who threepeated twice. On the other hand there are Teams like the 2008 Celtics where ppl (exept Ray) still stick up for eachother more then a decade later and also 2009-2011 Barca where the core guys constantly shower eachother with praise and never said a bad word about eachother.  There are different teams dynamics and they can work in different ways I mean its obvious that some players demandes sth from other players that they were not ready/able to provide and in the end it boils down to trust Upset didnt trust Adam that they would keep the uinfrmation private Adam didnt trust Upset when he said that it is an important matter both are in the same boat here essentially.

hma0igg,ROX_Faker,11/27/2021,1,135.0,Definitely true for now I think. I was joking around though lol. I think super teams still exist. They basically have top three players at every position and good synergy with each other.
hma0nap,tanezuki,11/27/2021,1,70.0,People uses Bruisers but I find this confusing.  Riven is a bruiser but she isnt a fighter shes a slayer=> Skirmisher.  Yet most people will consider her a bruiser because its a community box category that includes nearly all the Fighters in it them being Juggernauts or Divers aswell as the skirmishers.
hm906dz,PM_something_German,11/27/2021,1,29.0,Pretty sure few years ago they made it so that untargetable doesnt drop turret aggro either can be seen when playing Fizz or Vlad.  Otherwise something like Camille ult or Yi Q would also drop aggro which would be ridiculous.  u/Caenen_ ?
hma7tv2,xWangan,11/27/2021,1,145.0,I still think it must be Selfmades fault. Im sure he blackmailed either Upset or a family member of his to make him leave his team at Worlds.   Somehow Selfmade always manages to get involved.

hm9bu8n,Quazz,11/27/2021,1,359.0,The only reason the servers are split is because the combined EU server in early days of league caught fire on the regular.  Even now when something like clash launches EUW is the region most likely to hit issues and catch fire.  Combining the servers sounds simple in theory but in practice we can expect a lot of issues perhaps not to the extent to season 2/3 anymore (hopefully the way its all set up is much better now) but still.

You know nothing and youll trying to say something without any knowledge on the topic.  They played together with almost the same roster for fucking 4 years. All of them needed change grabbz even said that in his interview. None of them is hurt or want revange. This change will benefit all of them.
hmb413n,Klaymoor11,11/27/2021,1,34.0,Little by little TBH. Taking it all at the same time is A LOT but when you break it down in parts and take your time to understand it all its not that bad.  The way I did it was by playing a few champions went into Practice Mode and took some time reading their abilities their items (the in-game recommendations are great for new players since online guides can be overwhelming at times) and with time it started clicking. Yes reading isnt the most thrilling thing in the world but youd be surprised how a few words can change the way you look at the game.     If youre going to do that I HIGHLY recommend starting with mechanically simple champions so you can focus on other things. I started with some advanced champions and for a while that held me back until I understood what the heck was going on. Also when in Practice press Esc for game options go to Interface and look for Always show extended Tooltips. Abilities items and such will show more numbers and details thatll help you understand how things work.

hm9aw9b,NattyGainz,11/27/2021,1,158.0,So just wanna add if you’re MMR is high that means opponents are better as well. Let’s say you have play MMR and you end up silver (so system will give you big LP gains to catch up nice right?). Except if you have to play MMR while you have inflated your rank. It means you will likely win less than 50% and might have a negative winrate despite having good LP gains.   Your rank will sooner or later always end up matching your skill.

hm9qcq8,azersub,11/27/2021,1,131.0,First of all how does Nemesis or Selfmade have anything to do with Caps situation when they werent there?  Secondly as i said i didnt blame Rekkles that much for leaving last year cause whole Fnatic looked in turmoil. When Caps leftFnatic were literally in grand finals of the worlds and won 2 consecutive EU splits. Also Fnatic invested in Caps development and he ditched them for biggest rival at first possible monent. He is biggest eu traitor since Zven and Mithy  And sure now Caps and Jankos dont agree with Rekkles on how to play the game but back then Caps was super youn and had no idea how he wants to play so that argument doesnt make much sense either
hmaazbf,gnfsp,11/27/2021,1,313.0,Him and his family were already made up. He had been seeing them again for several years.  He was kicked out of his house a little over 10 years ago. https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/izt4n/hi_im_doublelift_formerly_of_team_eg_and_today_i/  8 years ago Travis posted this video https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RUGFOMUnFdg  3 years ago was when the tragedy happened.  I dont think its fair to downplay his situation by saying he had a tense relationship with his family he made made many comments throughout the years about them and it was rough at first but they were on the mend and working it out.
hmaj7ib,Mahelas,11/27/2021,1,136.0,I mean the original KC had Adam the Cabo version is already not the KC
hmado14,streyer,11/27/2021,1,310.0,yeah teams dont have to be all best friends but if Ronaldo or Jordan had left 12 hours before the start of the finals you think their team wouldnt demand an explanation?   the entire team worked together for an entire year doing everything they could to get to that point and then one guy leaves makes all their effort worthless the least they deserve is an explanation. urgent family emergency is not enough cause that is so vague it tells you nothing thats the kind of excuse you give your teacher when you are skipping class you dont have to tell them everything but just enough that they can picture themselves in that situation and say yeah ok i would do the same so that they know its justified and they didnt just waste a year of their lives.
hmazq3x,Umarill,11/27/2021,1,,I noticed it too because the guy is spamming :3 with EVERY comment in EVERY thread. Then you check their post history and see that it is pure spam every minute they are awake.

hma79j9,AmazingNumber4405,11/27/2021,1,14.0,After watching this I realize their supervisor was another hidden gem on snake that helped to put them into the right mindset to go on a huge winning streak.

hmao37d,MoonDawg2,11/27/2021,1,140.0,Kraken is good galeforce is pretty shit since it gets hard outscaled (unless youre burst oriented aka jhin and maybe lucian though he sucks) wits end is extremely situational being only used on on-hit builds  and shieldbow is shit unless youre vayne ashe or kog.  LDR is shit because of the build path and that it just doesnt do enough damage most of the time. Check the stats on when its build second or third its horrid.  The role has pretty shit itemisation atm and the issue is crit and other roles just getting straight up more impactful items.

hm9bcxj,HoloHuni,11/27/2021,1,568.0,Jinx has been a very niche pick for ages (basically season 6) and riot tried to fix it in 2017. They made her W scale with crit and it made for [some great content for Vandiril.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQgZ4vw9xM4) And then there was also this Galio q buff where they made the health percentage scaling super high and then he could [oneshot tanks with Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMg7ZEV5x5I).
hm9ae2n,Talonoscopy,11/27/2021,1,210.0,Hopefully you guys are also taking a look on nerfing her shes currently busted (and has been) in solo q.        Jinx is an abomination and shouldnt exist.  &#x200B  (Except Arcane Jinx shes perfect)
hma9spj,tortillakingred,11/27/2021,1,311.0,This is kind of like an “Am I the Asshole” post but everyone is split.  I personally agree with DL on this but I understand the side of Upset/Yamato etc. I also think that Adam’s statement was kinda cringe in some parts by trying to be the victim but at the end of the day I really can’t think of any situation big enough that your teammates don’t deserve to know.
hm93iz3,Karoth4,11/27/2021,1,38.0,Same as Thornmail it could be discussed if it is intended that Mortal reminder passive isnt the best for carries like Jhin or Samira because yes you can build it and yes you can proc the 60% grievous wounds but neither of those champs would land the same autoattacks as someone like vayne caitlyn jinx...  Im not entirely sure why not all the grievous wounds items apply the same way but well i guess for variety.

hmad5mk,Falsus,11/27/2021,1,310.0,I mean isnt that what Upset did? He communicated that someone very close to him was going through something really bad for a while and it got really really bad shortly before worlds started.

hm903kx,TheLifePocketKnife,11/27/2021,1,199.0,I had contacted Riot so many times over the years since he has been reworked and always got back 3 lines as a response even with a similar amount of documentation. 4000+ words and numerous tickets always yielded a well look into it. Good on you you were able to get the ball rolling. Myself and many others I know actually stopped playing Talon because of the bugs. One thing that is worthy noting that is more vanity but with his Blackwood skin his jaw is crooked thats what showed me the effort Riot put into this champ. Funnily enough I was saving up a fair bit of clips when I did play League for a similar video as this but props to you for getting it done. Cheers nonetheless.  Edit: One more thing is how infuriated I always was I was always told to sit down and stop complaining and that the champion is not buggy that I was just bad. I remember showing a detailed replay with the leblanc snare and Talon q and being told that is normal. So to see such a well made video detailing everything makes me feel heard more than Riot ever did.

hma4fe7,anaf28,11/27/2021,1,13.0,IMO the game doesn’t have to be story driven or have any story elements for people to be inspired from the show to try out the game. I was personally very excited to play Jayce after watching Arcane although there’s no story content in League of Legends summoners rift gameplay. It was simply exciting for me and I had a good time.
hm9lbjb,yawgmotha,11/27/2021,1,3975.0,Probably because he is FNCs franchise player now? or he doesnt have the power. According to Upsets tweet he was asked by management to help get Alphari Adam may interpreted such move as a wtf I am the only one who come out to support you on social media for leaving Worlds yet you have the audacity to say I am not good enough for the team while you abandon us all. so it is war now.

Guys my wife was just taken to the hospital I gotta take the next flight home. You wouldnt share that with people at work? People you work with 6 or 7 days a week? 12 hours a day? The people who are about to get shit on at the thing everyone worked for a year cause you gotta leave?   > like being pregnant and losing the child  Again say your wife has a medical emergency and that shes in the hospital.

hmavgfp,snowflakepatrol99,11/27/2021,1,305.0,> Mages/ Senna are too squishy and can be punished by enemy jungler very easily  They can when people know that they need to do that and when they can also execute it. He is talking about climbing to diamond. No one is fucking punishing you in those divisions for being too squishy.    [Look at bronze support win rate and how its all squishy immobile mages](https://i.imgur.com/Sx6luBa.png)  Good job on your climb but you really are talking a lot of bullshit on your quest of proving how support isnt the easiest role in the game to climb.

hm9hqbt,K1ndr3dSoul,11/27/2021,1,32.0,With a therapist all they can really do is talk to me about strategies or be vented to. Its all on me 100% to do anything and I feel I already have strategies or coping mechanisms (which arent enough for me to be where I want to be but neither are theirs) so I dont see the point.    Im content with my life with the only exception being that Im NEET and find most jobs to be too stressful or overwhelming (even with medication. It just makes me happy in my default state of NEET) so Ive just stayed home (parents not into that so they kicked me out after dropping out of University so Ive just been living with whoever Im dating at the time). It sucks not having spending money and relying on others but Im just not very functional in workplaces I tried.
hm9cm6h,googlebeast,11/27/2021,1,1.0,Amazing edit
hm9p3pg,vpvp1,11/27/2021,1,13.0,agree. My friends hardstucked silver 1/gold 5 for 4 years when I played with him he played legitimately like a gold5 game knowledge and mechanics of a gold5. But somehow he got d4 in season 9 or 10 as support main.  And from what Ive seen on streams lots of master elo supports play like d4 so I come to conclusion the role has been inflated and tyler1 shares the same opinion. Even Dopa said something similar about support role this year he said something like  lower 1 division of a support player and youll get their true rank

If it wasn’t private enough to tell your coach it’s not private enough to keep your teammates out of the loop. The coach isn’t the only person on the team. From Adam’s view this guy just dipped cuz he felt like it even though that’s not the case but it’s essentially the same if you don’t give an explanation as to why and make vague statements.

hmaf0or,CaptainLocoMoco,11/27/2021,1,63.0,The training data has these descriptions baked in to some degree. Otherwise theres no way to be so accurate
hm9zpv7,quiteUnskilled,11/27/2021,1,133.0,2015 Fnatic was also great as was Origen but more due to the fact that the west did not even feel close to the east in 2013 and 2014 and 2015 Fnatic/Origen changed that. But I wouldnt think of them as actual title contenders that year more like dark horses the rest was mostly hype due to the expectations having been so low from the years before imo.
hm8y2eb,thrownawayzs,11/27/2021,1,196.0,theres micro and macro level knowledge and gameplay in league. support doesnt have nearly as much in both categories  as other roles. saying its the easiest role isnt wrong but its not particularly accurate.
hm9ar2l,Pheraprengo,11/27/2021,1,359.0,EU as a whole is signicantly more toxic thsn lther regions.  EUNE is more toxic than EUW I can support that with my own experience.
hm9nkbf,greeyt,11/27/2021,1,3.0,mute them simply as that and report them after game. riot is quite serious about that kind of offensive language (punishment are 100% not severe enough it should be instant bannable with a lifetime! not just simple 10 games chat restrict to 1 messeage per 3 or 4 minutes). for me its simple as that.
hmb4ni3,Mixed_not_swirled,11/27/2021,1,192.0,So explain to me what is so garbage about Singeds kit: What is it that makes this champion not be able to compete with other champions?
hm9oucb,WrathB,11/27/2021,1,129.0,Crazy that Fnatic 2019 was on simmilar level yet people forget it an LEC team in group with giants like T1 and RNG eliminating Uzi from Worlds and losing to eventual champions FPX 3-1 with actually better score than G2 Fnatic was deffinetely an insane team in 2019
hm8vxny,DelDoesReddit,11/27/2021,1,56.0,Honestly if you squint closely at the Singed in-game model while he uses R it looks like hes spewing the potion back out
hmai438,DoorHingesKill,11/27/2021,1,376.0,Yeah really feels like Yamato couldnt be bothered to defend Upset in his absence to get the team (well 3 of them) to at least approve of the necessity.

hm8y15b,ApokalypticKing101,11/27/2021,1,,Nasus Trundle Yorick are some of the best imo but a lot of bruisers with auto resets and that hull breaker item. And a lot of ap champs since ap damage scales super hard on turrets so things like TF and other Lich bane champs.

hmb3md1,ChiefBoss99,11/27/2021,1,147.0,It’s FPX fault for not scouting properly. If this behavior was so well known then they should have known it might be an issue. Clearly they were gambling that they could overcome it and they almost did. But it is completely on FPX if it goes wrong.

hm9wzma,vcii_vcii,11/27/2021,1,5.0,Especially with the Bo situation speculation of awkward relationship between Doinb and Tian FPX had a really rough spring. If you watched LPL you know how great they played at spring play offs and summer afterwards we all thought nuguri was integrating better with the team. Really sad how they imploded at worlds.
hm9menw,GunnerPup13,11/27/2021,1,,I’m glad to know that I’m not the only one who feels like the more recent Pokémon games have been kind of going downhill. I feel like I’m running out of ideas. To the point that they’re just releasing older games. That’s not always bad but there comes a point where it’s no longer nostalgic. If that makes sense. I really do like my older Pokémon games I still have my copy of leaf green. But I’m not spending as much money in a newer Pokémon game unless they add something really cool. And I’m sorry Dyna Max evolutions are not doing it for me. They’re cool but I wouldn’t have made most of the game around it. I will say with sword and shield I loved the map. I really liked the region and I thought it was really cool. But I feel like a lot of these re-releases of older games and starting to get to be a little too repetitive. Because didn’t we have another version of gold and silver not even 10 years ago? And didn’t they do a release of diamond and pearl twice? At that point that’s a little excessive. If you’re going to release a game release at once. After that that needs to be a little bit more than just 10 years in between the games. It’s like Disney movies nowadays. They keep releasing older movies as live action. I don’t necessarily mind it but some of them are really boring. I could not stand the remake of Mulan and I don’t know very many people who liked it. And I don’t blame people for not liking it. I watched it once and I do not wanna watch it again.
hma2y8j,hobble_wobble,11/27/2021,1,28.0,It’s on EDG’s Youtube channel sorry it’s hard to find because they have so many videos lol but you can try searching among the videos that were posted around the start of the year.   But in summary IIRC: Aaron (EDG’s manager) explained how they formed this season’s roster — Firstly they wanted to build it around Meiko so they had to convince him to renew his contract which was tough since they’ve been underperforming and Meiko received offers from basically every team that needed a support.  Once Meiko agreed to stay next on the list was Scout/Flandre who joined (can’t remember the order) with Scout renewing only if Meiko renews. Next was Jiejie.   The last player needed was an ADC who has a huge carry potential as Scout expressed that he was stressed with the carry role. So with 4 pretty solid players already locked in EDG knew they could try convincing a star player to join and Scout went to talk to Viper who was looking to join a team.
hmaa0su,Delt4Zer0,11/27/2021,1,8.0,Thanks man. I dont like champions that have sooo much text you dont even want to read it. So ty
hmahfgs,SP3EDI,11/27/2021,1,376.0,how so ? they demand to know specifics about upset so they can decide if it was enough reason for them to judge the whole issue. Its shows what bad characters those 3 have. Its easy to shift the blame to upsetmanagement etc. when only they decide when there was enough infos for them to be satisfied.

hm9qd1f,Phantomx_Destiny,11/27/2021,1,26.0,First of all are you talking about rankednormalsaram or a special event mode? Are you a casual player? Do you play a lot?  This is somewhat important to know because if you tell me you play once every month and your a very casual player and thats how you enjoy playing I think thats fine.  But if you play ranked or draft normals often and never ff a losing game in those 2 modes when its a clear lost and everyone is voting yes its kind of a selfish move when everyone else just wants another fresh match because imo and I think the majority of players would agree playing a fair match where you dont know the outcome is the most fun.  But hey if you always want to stretch a 100% losing game in ranked/draft normals 5-15 more minutes and you find that fun more power to you just realize its selfish and the majority of players dont like it.
hma8mir,GA_Deathstalker,11/27/2021,1,314.0,and to complete this paradoxon: Adam at the same time proves that Upset was correct in not trusting him
hm9boko,kragnor,11/27/2021,1,51.0,But normal wigs worn for everyday wear arent oversized.   Neither are any of the wigs used by actors for films. They all look normally sized.
hm9bhqx,Urlilas,11/27/2021,1,158.0,I didnt play much league for 2/3 years but when I did I was OTP eve (D2~master) and landing W wasnt necessary in late game and I would only use it so instantly slow the enemy and 1 shot him. Basically W is only usefull early to boost damage or late if you fight a tank/bruiser alone. The thing is that early I want to avoid boots as it reduces the burst during a window where Evelynn is already short on damage and late you absolutely dont want your position to be known or them being aware of you so you dont want to use predator. Basically early game you had less damage with predator during a window where you only need damage (except if they drastically changed that). And late game you can trap better without predator.  The only good thing is that if you time predator well you can gap close faster but at the same time if they see the icon above their head they are ready to react so you loose your advantage.  Thats why I dont understand why you would take the rune back then. But the game has changed a lot and if electrocute is nerfed + predator is buffed maybe it is worth.
hm8xpkn,Kripox,11/27/2021,1,322.0,If its a recent transfer its just smurf queue. I always play on the same account but something as simple as switching from normals to ranked towards the end of the season to get my season rewards results in immediate trash tier games. When I started playing ranjed this year I had afk’ers in my team 5 games in a row shit was nuts. However after playing for long enough the matchmaking eventually sorted itself out the games became bearable and I could actually play properly again.
hmamllx,Toast72,11/27/2021,1,140.0,no they do this every season to adcs so I just expect it every preseason
hma2sik,Rektile7,11/27/2021,1,149.0,Its not about him not playing its about completely keeping his teammates in the dark. Of course not everyone can have the mental strength of Charles but everyone can have enough decency to explain to their team why they are leaving 12h before the most important tournament of their year (or for Adam of his life)
hmagxmt,SP3EDI,11/27/2021,1,376.0,We already know that he told them that he has a serious fam issue himself before leaving. We know Yamato also told them that it was serious enough that he and management allowed upset to leave.   That is more then fucking enough. He has no right to know the specifics.

hma62kf,Ahrlin4,11/27/2021,1,58.0,The key thing is whats done with the keyword. An AI could search for every mention of the word Shurima create a word cloud (figuratively speaking) of all words associated with that pull out the ones relating to aesthetic details (like hot sandy desert etc.) and then create a picture based on that. And the picture ends up looking like Shurima.  By comparison if the AI is drawing a picture solely based on the word Shurima with absolutely nothing else going on its essentially just magic.  There are other possibilities of course. As someone else mentioned its possible they have a base picture input to start with (e.g. of Shurima taken from the league wiki or whatever) and then the AI is merely blurring some details and making it look abstracted.

hm950rp,Amsement,11/27/2021,1,199.0,Because stats dont mean everything? If you watched Jensens play overall this year and think hes worth the buyout + salary he probably wants thats your prerogative but it seems most teams dont think that way and seemingly so do some other people in the scene. TL clearly doesnt think Jensen is worth it over a player that hasnt played for a full year.   No one is doubting that Jensen is good enough to be in LCS and I would gander that the reason he isnt playing is because he wants a salary that teams dont want to pay not because they dont think hes good. I wouldnt say teams are sleeping for not wanting to spend a shit ton for Jensen and simultaneously help stuff TLs pockets even more.

hm9eh9k,WintersEnvoy,11/27/2021,1,10.0,Hoping for any serious kind of adc changes is masochism I waited for 3 years since 2018 stormrazor rush meta. Even with new items crit was hard ignored despite still being one of the worst item classes in the game.  Seriously if I were you Id brace for like at best 1-2 % AS per stack buff and even a nerf on the range part because its too good on specific adcs and unimpactful on most others (since its so hard to hit 6 autos for most adcs in current league).  &#x200B  A reasonable change would probably be to make it stack on abilities for ranged champs but not melees (and adjust it accordingly) but thats asking too much of riot conqueror was broken for 2 years flat before riot finally nerfed it before the end of this season and decided that tempo also had to be (very) viable on bruisers which was such a coincidence! Adcs had fervor of battle taken away warlords bloodlust got shafted into fleetfootwork which was nerfed into oblivion and obscurity PTA was good for a few patches before it was nerfed into oblivion because its too powerful on like mostly lucian and tristana and unusable/crutch runes for every other adc. Theres not much left on this role crit is bad LDR is monstriously inefficient most champs in the game can go full dmg + tabi build and negate most adc 3 item builds. Adc champs have some of the worst base stats and health regens get gutted faster than any other role when overtuned and buffed at an astonishingly slow rate when their champs are underpowered.  Even this lategame fantasy some people imagine adcs to be is so horrifically untrue for champs outside of like jinx and kogmaw champs like viktor are vastly more terrifying and impactful. Not that you get to reach late and impact more than 1/5 games anyway.  Actually the most disgusting part about the lack of buffs or how unimpactful they are for adcs is how much people defend it on places like this. Graves was not meta for half a year and he gets +1 ad per level kalista or sivir cant be touched because she was super strong once implying that not every adc in the game has been at some point (given so few champs)... **You just get these unbelievably hypocritical mouthbreathers who say kalista or sivir cant get buffs because of a meta that happened 2-5 years ago yet graves can get one of the biggets buffs the last 3 years even if hes been meta like 7 times since his release.**

hm9v33r,hiccup333,11/27/2021,1,12366.0,Its not what the creators intended but that is how it came across.  Like failures of execution of character moments.  The punch seemed way overdone and out of character for Vi even for what Jinx did.  Also after years of not seeing Jinx after they got captured by Ekko she goes with them at first to the surface (as far as the bridge) instead of immediately wanting to find Jinx.  Then she leaves her again for Caitlyn.  I was super invested in the sisters relationship so this was all disappointing to see
hm95jp9,Reddit12btw,11/27/2021,1,153.0,Perkz didnt seem to enjoy his millions of dollars that much.  Feels like broxah would do much better staying in EU abbedagge got into 100t because schalke imploded and I doubt zven is making millions.

hmae98f,LeFiery,11/27/2021,1,,Well I *think* riot has stated theyre gonna conform more to what the chinese playerbase wants because they are the biggest players of league.   It sucks but business has to boom or theres no business

hmar2d4,Dastu24,11/27/2021,1,18.0,Yup i agree but i tend to dfall into category of ppl who go for the kill i tend to carry but sometimes fail and have to let others and just play safe.    So even with my/our playstyle it worked
hma3hiq,Velorym,11/27/2021,1,372.0,I really wish they’d have picked something other than imagine dragons for their music. It’s like picking slightly different versions of the same song for everything

hm94xsz,SocialistScissors,11/27/2021,1,28.0,The 2 he didnt give it to were both of the support players aswell. I wonder if he holds the role to a higher standard considering just how good he is at it.

hm8vmvr,ArchMageMagnus,11/27/2021,1,37.0,It honestly doesnt feel this way. Mid to late game hes running around 3 shotting towers and when you go to that tower to defend hes already ran to another one. If he catches any champ out he stun locks you and youre dead after 3-4 hits.

hm9uqhb,dogchamp9,11/27/2021,1,22.0,Np theyre good into different matchups garen is good against assassins Annie is good against all squishy characters and ahri is good against immobile champs.  Also dont take Annie or ahri top lane garen is good top tho
hm99hin,AlaanaBanana,11/27/2021,1,6.0,I would say in this case mid lane. The simple answer is if you are skilled that role has the most agency in the game because.. it is in the middle of the map. You can: play lane to manipulate into shoving or freezing for macro you can invade or defend their/your jungle typically the quickest you can roam to bottom lane or rotate to either objective pretty easily. And lastly you can roam top lane.  Okay that last one was a joke. But not only for these reasons of agency you will also work the most with other lanes to get to know the overall game macro quicker than playing either side lane. Of course jungle is similar for the same reasons but I would still lean towards mid because of minion manipulate.
hma3qg9,promethvzine,11/27/2021,1,6.0,>u’re using the default left click attack move settings enable minimap moveme  it was shift but thanks a lot didnt know this worked!

hma0p5o,SadPeggy,11/27/2021,1,2.0,a) People can ff because they used the wrong emote if they want to having a read on statistics is not giving them a reason to ff.   b) In other MOBAs the team gold statistic is available yet the ff ratio is probably the same.
hm9y0k1,Tuelegend,11/27/2021,1,188.0,You sure it’s their education
hm9yrgr,jarredhtg,11/27/2021,1,2.0, Because why give players more reasons to ff?
hm9qbr2,CCrimson93X,11/27/2021,1,8.0,Cheers dude nice to see a positive comment on this. Upvoted! :)
hm9wihu,TheWorldisFullofWar,11/27/2021,1,6.0,>late game  They overbuffed LDR so much that I see it built as a second item extremely successful. ADC items need nerfs across the board tbh.
hma4kdb,Just4TehLulz,11/27/2021,1,4.0,30% of games you cant win 30% of games you cant lose its the 40% in the middle you should care about and loser queue just absolutely exists. You can bust out a main or ask for a duo if youre below GM.
hmay4ms,HarmlessSnack,11/27/2021,1,84.0,Jungle isn’t actually super hard to learn but if you DONT know what your doing and your opponent jungles does know… well they can kinda just win the game.  Jungle influences the whole map and so if your jungler is severely outmatched it can just lose your team so much moral they surrender.  That being said if you watch some YouTube videos and LEARN jungle early you can pick a dominant jungler and win games for your team pretty easily at low ranks.
hmaitoq,jer487,11/27/2021,1,4.0,I have a crush on all of them lol But I mainly want to dominate it seems.
hm9k3oe,pepperpete,11/27/2021,1,54.0,I agree the only reason I wouldnt straight up say hes the best top in the World is because we havent seen him go up against other top laners outside the LPL this past year but if I was forming a team with no import restrictions hed definitely be my choice for the role. Along with Canyon in the jungle I think those would be my only clear choices every other role would have 2 or 3 potential players.  EDIT: Nevermind with Uzi coming back I would pick him over any other ADC regardless of form dude is my favourite player ever.
hmalcib,ArtisticAd7135,11/27/2021,1,,yup still not out

hm93iug,deliriouskai,11/27/2021,1,253.0,So Ghost was ready as long as the agreed upon salary was equal or more than current? And theres something about T1 in the comments too. Canna wanted his way but T1 already had an agreement with NS before DK came into the picture? I really wish the timeline was clearer lol.  But man I feel so bad for players who get involved in these PR tussles. I cant completely blame the orgs either they have the players under contract so they are thinking about the best way to profit too. Its pretty much a helpless situation for the players. No wonder they have been expressing themselves on social media to let out their frustrations.
hm9jx6k,voidxleech,11/27/2021,1,130.0,you know what can ruin even the best cosplay for me? a cringy lip sync tik tok. i’m curious do people actually enjoy this kind of content?

hm9g9lo,Zefionx,11/27/2021,1,19.0,I love Aram. I play it more then 5v5. Since they removed 3v3 i don´t actually care. Sometimes i play flex with my friends but mostly aram. The best part is when you get a shitter who crys about your teamcomp being not strong enough and then leaving because u lack dmg or smth.
hm8ubc9,anaf28,11/27/2021,1,12358.0,Just because a character is a champion doesn’t mean they can’t die. The fact that they’re in the game just demonstrates who they are at whatever time.

hm9e1w0,ApplePitou,11/27/2021,1,4.0,The most important thing is for the team to play like a team and help each other therefore it is worth taking advantage of ganks when your opponent is pushed under tower to help your team :3
hm9ng6m,Angry---train,11/27/2021,1,27.0,What the fuck is this clown shittery?  ADCs got batshit insane items like Kraken SlayerGaleforceLDRWits EndShieldbow and many more and you are calling fucking LDR the 105% gold efficient item with an insane passive inefficient.

hm9bjla,Liyandri,11/27/2021,1,27.0,iirc the winter map was turned off by default in ranked.

hmao9wg,VisageViolet,11/27/2021,1,1.0,Highly recommend not playing on the PBE if you care about improving or rank. Most of the players on PBE are pretty unskilled and the quality of games is really low.

hmaesib,TheMightyBaloon,11/27/2021,1,10.0,It is. In a matter of fact someone is wasting your time.  My anger usually comes from the fact that they will keep inting.  It was someone understood back in the early seasons that going 0-3 is not bad as long as you keep in cs and in xp. But these days people will drop down 40 cs and 2 levels and still try to outplay someone that is an item ahead of them.  It is like when someone is on purpose passing the ball to the wrong person

I dont have the link anymore but there was a similar post in the WoW subreddit I think not so long ago with a link to the original pictures pre-morphing. If it was generated from 0 it would be very impressive but if you put the Original & the Edit side by side you can tell theyre the same picture.

hm9dqz1,MrDrugnut,11/27/2021,1,30.0,Toxicity comes when you are being the 1 vote that causes the early surrender to fail. Dont be that guy.  What do you play for? Im sorry do you consider inevitable defeat fun? No I dont enjoy watching grey screens on loop. Again I dont think anyone is asking you to go next if the game is relatively even. If it happens at 1-0 its either a joke or a real troll. But once a snowball is in motion once all lane prios are lost and you are 2-3 dragons behind and you cant overstep anywhere without dying asap... its time to go. If bot lane is looking like a 600 gold objective for mid and jungle then its time to go.
hmaakbi,XiaoRCT,11/27/2021,1,313.0,Not how it works at all. Adam exposed the drama but it has nothing to do with the idea that he could have been explained what happened.

hm9kg8l,dr3amstate,11/27/2021,1,12.0,Riot did the same with Imagine Dragons. And tbh that was the only weak part of the show.   I’d love if they just stick with their Arcane soundtrack instead of random pop music

hman8ua,bupropiom,11/27/2021,1,20.0,Skarners lane has a bit of a learning curve and yeah there are weak pre 6 games but fairly often I can force someone out of lane or solo kill pre 6. Lane is all about understanding who to peel and when not always listening to people pinging your flash and the enemy support to flash ult. Hes incredibly strong in skirmishes and can really control fights by absorbing damage with shield and getting stuns off.
hmahhf7,NeekoBestTomato,11/27/2021,1,376.0,You seem to be highly unclear on what actually happened. Let me educate you:  1) Emergency occurs Upset goes home. This is fine. NOBODY has an isssue with this stop asserting this strawman.  2) Emergency is resolved. Meanwhile as a consequence of Upset leaving Fnc the org and 4 players have a years worth of time and effort wasted forever.  3) Nearly a month has passed. There is no emergency what is done is done. Communication can happen before this but if it hasnt now is a good time. Its what a decent normal human being would do. Because a decent normal human being would understand that yes something bad did happen Upset did ALSO fuck over a lot of people - and he at LEAST should talk it over with those people he giga fucked to make sure everyone has no bad blood.  4) Upset doesnt do this and actualy backstabs the people he fucked over. Oh and they arent allowed to be angry because upset is still playign victim for him being a dick. All of which shows that he has NO respect whatsoever for anybody not called Hyli and Yamato. Look whos not on the team anymore btw.  Do you get the point now?  Yes in the moment - you are emotional. Fair enough.  But a LOT of time has passed.   If you are still emotional - get the FUCK off the team and take an extended break. If you arent stop being a dick.

hm90mwx,AlbertoTyp,11/27/2021,1,67.0,For a character like Poppy you make her slightly larger than canon and animate her in a way where she holds her hammer up straight. Then itd be similar to [Charlotta from Granblue Fantasy Versus](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/OblongCourageousAnhinga-max-1mb.gif) where her crown acts as part of her body that can be hit. I think this approach would work for some yordles.

He talked to his other teammates. He doesnt need nor should have to let them know everything. Them being coworkers doesnt mean they are entitled to know details. No he doesnt have to know Yamato since he was born this one is actually hilarious and shows me youre very blinded to this whole thing. Dont think his teammates mean nothing to him but Im pretty sure his family means more to him which is.... understandable? LMAO
hm9mfvg,supterfuge,11/27/2021,1,171.0,>Ok what’s immoral about choosing Larssen who’s still one of the best mids in EU?  After 2 years and a half Larssen is still absolutely incapable of teamfighting. Which is weird because as VTO would put it The hard part is laning even my grandma could teamfight well. But no if the game goes past 20 minutes Larssen is going to be absolutely invisible.  Hans Sama and Inspired were the two players who could actually create play around the map which was Rogues main weakness. Now Rogue sold the 2 players that helped them get a gameplan and got themselves a jungler that probably doesnt speak english fluently and an extremely unimpressive ADC.   This Rogue team is just absolutely full of players incapable of carrying. I 100% believe theyre going to be a benchmark and nothing more. If you can lane against Odo/Larssen congratulations youve beaten Rogue.

hm9yx0e,Dage-The-Ninja,11/27/2021,1,53.0,It feels like they balanced it for late game 5v5 team fights.  Stacking what seems like more than needed stats on melee so they can get it stacked and be useful.  And very little on marksmen because its basically inevitable to get it late game. Though a big portion of its strength is the added range the uncapping of attack speed is huge for some marksmen. It used to only be windowed in the old LT for 3 to 6 seconds. Now its uncapped as long as youre attacking. You can build AS on marksmen without fear of overcapping or wasting a steroid in your kit.
hm9y9ty,piotrj3,11/27/2021,1,,So that is why Yasuo/Yone had emergency buffs with new ADC items and that is why Sivir/Varus/Caitlyn goes lethality and this is why GP was useless entire season until they made  a change to improve his crit builds. Ah and this is why Ziggs had to be nerfed because he dominated botlane too much. Aha crit items are OP.  Seriously think about past seasons eg. does anyone remember season 3 as ADC season - no it was mage/assasin season. Would ADC main love to return to those items from S3 absolutly. Would assasin/bruiser main/mage main wanted to return to them - fuck no.

hm9bnq3,NattyGainz,11/27/2021,1,158.0,Sure but what I mean is easy wins are a bit useless. Because if you didn’t earn them you’re gonna drop down back anyways.   Same with this OP. He says he has improved a lot in these last few days/weeks. Sure it’s possible. Different approach can mean a lot. But you also gonna be real how much did he really improve?  Having easier opponents easier games might give you the illusion that you’re getting better and playing better. But that’s just because the challenge isn’t there.   I’ve hd games as well were I felt like I out macrod and out played the enemy as well and thought if I could keep this up I’d reach Diamond. But if an high elo player would review my game he’d probably gasp at how many mistakes I made.
hmatsgi,Yetti2Quick,11/27/2021,1,305.0,? You literally have to almost carry every single game in low elo because you can’t ever count on your team to do well. Lol. At least in high elo you can coin flip way better players. Low elo is a complete crapshoot. So when ur playing non carry lanes like he had to do it’s just coin flipping better teammates.
hm9xd1b,angrynutrients,11/27/2021,1,288.0,The first like 4 were compiling the studio and talent the second season is currently slated for release in 2023 i think.

hmagxzf,bns18js,11/27/2021,1,20.0,Damage is SUPPOSED to be higher than defense late game. This is by design. Games need to end. Damage needs to be high enough so boring stalements dont happen.  This is why tanky characters --- tanks and bruisers are often the strongest champs in the mid game at 1-3 items where their items and high base numbers shine. But fall off during true late game at 4-5 items where ADCs and mages have enough damage to get through them again.  Phreak mentioned this in one of his videos. This is intentional. It serves a purpose.

hmb9xj5,DudeMcAwesome95,11/27/2021,1,264.0,Yea for ADCs the new LT is a complete joke. The extra range is completely broken but 9 out of 10 times youre not even getting max stacks before the teamfight is over. Twitch for example relies a lot on opening up a fight from his Q+R this worked well with the old LT since you could stack it beforehand using your W now your R duration is virtually over by the time youve hit max stacks and everyone is dead or you are.  If theyre going to keep the 30% AS boost for ranged then the cap needs to be removed from the first stack for ranged only so that champs can actually have the chance to stack it before a TF is over... or yknow just revert the fucking rune.

Also met a couple of very toxic swedes and danea which surprised me a lot given the nordic countries reputation.

hm8v3mr,NymphomaniacWalrus,11/27/2021,1,26.0,Not all of them and even then if you do buy tank items as a bruiser theyre highly situational.  Bruisers definitely have their own variety of items (Steraks Black Cleaver Deaths Dance Maw of Malmortius the two Hydras etc) and tanks have theirs.

You think its nice that hyli trusts Upset so much that he shouldnt want to know what happened but Upset doesnt trust Adam to understand the reasoning behind his dissappearance and hence not wanting to tell him. Then gets angry because Adam airs it out?..  Dont you think telling Adam would change how Adam viewed the situation? In Adams eyes upset left for whatever reason --> then tried to get him kicked off because he didnt aspire to reach as high as Upset.  What is this mental gymnastics?  Saying Adam invites people to harass Upset and his wife is just plain wrong and youre now inviting people to harass Adam using your logic no?

Maybe they are some more shady stuff we dont know about lmao. But yeah Ill give you that.  Still Adam got his shot at world taken away from him and considering they are tossing him away like trash afterwards might be his only one.. Upset didnt trust Adam with private matter(rightfully I agree) but Adam doesnt have to trust him on his good reason either. So yeah his frustration and anger are totally understandable. Is him twittlongering about it fine? Hell no but unfortunately it seems its how things are done in eSports..

hm9lmkd,supterfuge,11/27/2021,1,166.0,From what insiders have told us players dont get their full salary if theyre not starting but a % of it. Obviously the bigger the player the higher the % of their  starting salary they have to be paid. But if Hans is benched next year and hes earning ~1.6M a year as a starter we can assume that hes NOT going to earn that next year.  Multiple people even said that what was so crazy about Hunis contract two years ago was that all of it was guaranteed regardless of his performance.  So one bad split/year and they are earning a lot less next year contract or not. Especially in a team like TL that doesnt give a fuck and will bench you first opportunity they get for someone slightly better.

He wanted to leave and Fnatic got Humanoid to replace him what even is a big upgrade. Nisqy can only blame himself that no one wants him to play.   Adam was to be replaced anyway from fnatic. He himself wanted to go anyway so he got sold. Same as Nisqy no one forced him to play really bad at worlds.

hmaiz2d,AlcinousX,11/27/2021,1,13.0,I disagree. I dont think we need more mana. Theres enough options out there where you can choose to go into it or not. If your champion needs mana theres one out there that should suit your needs. If youre still having mana issues its probably more due to user error than lack of mana options. The true heavy mana users even opt for multiple of these. Champions having infinite mana was something intentionally addressed in previous seasons. If theres a bajillion items with mana everyone will have it and youll never have to worry about resource use which was the reason why they addressed it previously.

Well DL played a competitive match of LOL a couple of hours after his brother killed his parents Im pretty sure that I never would have said I would do the same under these circumstances and so other players might not have understood why he thought he left.   For me its kinda weird that you value the privacy of his famaly less then a working relatuionship. He also told Yamato who in turn thought that it was legit and let him leave.  Obviously you are free to not be sadisfied with the explonation but its still immature to go on record and slender your former teammate for that and him talking to another former teammate.

hm90ray,Witty-Kaleidoscope-9,11/27/2021,1,6.0,The concept is the definition of cliche theres barely any editing and youre talking endless gibberish while playing music with lyrics in the background. Your video is hurts to listen to.  Edit: Also [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYrywMehfOI). Rossboomsocks in 2016.
hmasc8u,Lv96Mudkip,11/27/2021,1,9.0,But you never explained why it feels wrong
hma7x1z,Saiko97,11/27/2021,1,6.0,I like Kog. Unfortunately hes only viable with the right support (Yuumi Lulu) and with a beefy frontline. Otherwise hes too slow and squishy and is one of the easisest champs to kill in the game.
hm9amqz,iiSystematic,11/27/2021,1,51.0,Well done but its mirrored in your recording. Her hair flip and tattoos are on her right side (the viewers left). I assume you did that but it recorded mirrored. Still. gj.
hm9vxev,NoBear2,11/27/2021,1,19.0,You think vlad is more niche than viktor?
hmadqoi,ThyPrasiolite,11/27/2021,1,310.0,Man just delete this comment.
hm9cip9,Kowaxmeup0,11/27/2021,1,200.0,Had a quick scroll he might be referring to never sharing someone elses content before. He mostly posts memes and as far as i can see in my 1 min research hasnt really posted peoples content to any subs before.
hmagir1,fnlbss,11/27/2021,1,12401.0,schizophrenia doesnt make you a psycho murderer. The idea that Jinx would want to hurt people crazy or not doesnt mesh with whats been shown in her back story the character is not shown to be a sociopath because she CLEARLY loves her sister and silco  I just rewrote the exact same thing as above but worded differently. I fucking hate reddit.
hma8um9,Gerblinoe,11/27/2021,1,,Ok have you ever gone through somebody having a medical emergency?   Because once they are in the hospital there is not that much you can do and with covid times you cant even sit at their bed the whole day  And you need to do something because sitting in your bed and just thinking is literally the worst feeling   So you smash some mindless arams. And for a proper depression aram mode 6 a day aint that much   Upset flew back because he decided that whatever happened his wife shouldnt go alone through  Is it a sickness in family? Is it death in family? Is it a miscarriage? I dont know   But with all of those options trying to find something to do to just stop thinking preferably with her seems pretty believable
hm9sd0v,_imrahulyadav,11/27/2021,1,9.0,Im new on league of legends and Im trash. I played my first match and teammates surrender saying that Im bad. Tell me a champion which is easy to learn. Pls
hma10o5,falkner97,11/27/2021,1,9.0,getting rekt 15/20 games is different from losing 15/20 games  theres a reason why i use getting rekt instead of losing in the first place

hmbap1c,HiImKostia,11/27/2021,1,125.0,Isnt the passive current % hp so it doesnt change much? Youre doing more damage if the enemy has more % hp than you. Id argue infernal is worse since tanks usually have better base damages.

hmaghch,shaidyn,11/27/2021,1,17.0,A lot of players cant carry but they can play safe. This is me.  The worse your team is the worse this playstyle is because theres a low likelihood that anyone on your team will carry.  But if you have a team of better players and all you do is not feed you have a much higher chance to be carried.

hmbdhl2,baked_tea,11/27/2021,1,,Exactly. The ult is up before they can even respawn. It was endgame

hmbp2sf,Blue_Seraph,11/27/2021,1,326.0,Galeforce has 6 times Stridebreakers CD and thats before accounting for AH. So even when I do believe Galeforce to be a very good item I see their point.
hm91yn7,SleepyLabrador,11/27/2021,1,23.0,He wanted to name himself The Zoom after The Shy. If he ever won an international title.
hm8v3i8,RubyXiaoLong,11/27/2021,1,18.0,Ive always thought that zoom was just overall better than 369. Never really got the hype behind that guy he had strong laning but besides that he never really stood out to me. Zoom is just the perfect top laner imo solid laning verstaile champion pool and amazing teamfighting. Now if only JKL can not spring it every other playoff series.
hm9ydtf,dinowithissues,11/27/2021,1,328.0,oh no  hide your blue gemstones everyone shes coming.
hm9cd0i,Kindly-Committee5823,11/27/2021,1,14.0,what I was trying to mainly do was going in with my ult then using my w to do splash damage and gain the shield while they were low and not prepared for a full push. then I let my teammates do the rest. I know it was more of a lucky play there but thanks for the feedback.
hm8x10s,zairrrrr,11/27/2021,1,12358.0,I second that. Especially when the second season isnt coming around until 2023 I fail to see why I should look forward to it.
hma16hy,tanezuki,11/27/2021,1,70.0,>From what I see nasus players just tend to sit on the bramble cus they get what they want and it lets them rush more important items like frozen and spirit. If you dont benefit from finishing thornmail dont get it till 6 items and hope someone on your team gets anti heal.  Thats exactly this but you still need the item when youre splitpushing. Splitpushers always have high sustain value and not having Bramble against them is suicidal. In end game splitpush doesnt work so Ill agree you have to rely on others to build it. Which is kinda annoying when Riot decided to make sure everyone would get access to anti heal in the first place.   About Yas and company its just an example to show being part of a class doesnt mean being forced into specific items. Rengar is a diver fighter yet everyone knows hes built as an assassin.
hmadf77,HazelCheese,11/27/2021,1,12395.0,The game doesnt represent the real world state of Runeterra. Its not like Fiddlesticks is going to take part in a random tournament.

hmb28ld,anoel24,11/27/2021,1,616.0,Which role do you want to play? These types of champions are commonly used in Top Support or Jungle. Examples: In top Malphite or Shen support Leona or Amumu in jungle Nunu or Warwick.

hm954fu,Machinegunmonke,11/27/2021,1,8.0,How are these so good?
hma9lvk,FantasyTrash,11/27/2021,1,311.0,It is none of his teammates’ business what goes on in his personal life. He is well within his rights to separate his job from his personal relationships. It is more than sufficient to say his family was having an urgent matter that must be attended to.
hmb17rb,CoogiMonster,11/27/2021,1,91.0,It always will be until whatever is going on with the team changes.  Right now everything seems based around being flashy and adjusting the game in grand ways.  Gates being placed whole invisible swaths just lots of things making each season more visibly different than the last.  No real energy devoted to addressing healing creep (that is worse with a zombie state on each champ) insane overkill (which is also worse now) and blatantly creating new drakes that absolutely make the old ones shit (Cloud drake is still insanely shit and could be deleted with nobody being upset.). All this said with 6 drakes the least they could do is buff individual drakes and nerf their soul counterpart.  Otherwise those first 2 drakes will rarely matter.

hm9u8y7,Morsmetus,11/27/2021,1,425.0,Even though wild rift has unified servers due to fact that I live in Georgia I get 9 Russian players almost 100% of the time and even though I understand the basic language I still prefer to play with English speaking players so I am fine with Russia having separate server to play on EU server and communicate on English
hm9twbc,Xaneth_,11/27/2021,1,288.0,Probably because shes mainly on Instagram and doesnt frequent Reddit a lot.
hm9lbfg,scti,11/27/2021,1,4.0,Yeah how about they just remove objective bounties. I mean before all that nobody said hey you know whats missing in League? Objective bounties!
hmae4ub,DoorHingesKill,11/27/2021,1,310.0,> Very little people are saying that his teammates shouldve not known more either.  Thats literally the entire argument of the pro Upset side let alone the pro Adam side lmao.
hm92cs1,SleepyLabrador,11/27/2021,1,145.0,Ill put it to you this way. TL is backed by Disney and the meme Paid by Steve doesnt exist for no reason. Steve has sent Faker a blank cheque offer every year.
hm8ufuh,GiannisisMVP,11/27/2021,1,125.0,Its on both I guess.  I was planning to do a showtime sub via Amazon will have to see which is cheaper.

hmakzx5,CreativeAd481,11/27/2021,1,23.0,Aatroxs revive was removed because he was in a situation where he was extremely powerful in pro play but was weak in solo queue. It was part of an attempt to make him more equitable across different skill levels. It has nothing to do with the Chemtech Soul.

hmafa09,crushingdarkness,11/27/2021,1,12401.0,Thats actually not true. Its shown since episode 1 that Noxus imports the Undercitys Shimmer and that even the council of Piltover cares alot about keeping up good relations with Noxians through trade. If the Noxians arent getting their shipments delivered they will want to know whats up who fucked up and what went wrong.
hmbkuh7,JimmyDuce,11/27/2021,1,156.0,I hope you have a good day honest.  I have no idea why you would take any pleasure intentionally trying to trigger someone particularly over one of the best players of a video game you play

hmbfrmj,Blood_Sck,11/27/2021,1,6.0,Lol have a big lore problem they have change the main lore 2 or 3 times over the 10 years and they have change some character lore thats the main reason they havent made any movie or series until now Arcane was good the hype hits more that they should I got excited over some references but they just touch the story of 5 or 6 champs and the story of 2 of the main cities Yes Arcane was good enjoyable for lol fans and for normal people explain a lot of thing but of course they can change anything they want on the main game story just to make it accurate with the Netflix adaptation and vice-versa

hm9q79u,SaulJoker,11/27/2021,1,15.0,Imagine how irrelevant that is to the point.  No matter how much you try to adjust the numbers it will completely break the balance of the game and invalidate the item system.   All it really does is buff resourceless champions by allowing them to buy items they’re already being incentivized NOT to buy.
hmaixtp,Oxen_aka_nexO,11/27/2021,1,114.0,And you came to that conclusion based on what?
hmb314s,penguin-cat,11/27/2021,1,4.0,there are a ton of icons in total and the majority arent available anymore. Mystery icon will only give you those that are either currently in the store or were available in the store at one point.  You can see every icon ever in collection > icons > all
hmb3mn4,Uhloy,11/27/2021,1,10.0,Make people agree to the ToS when buying (checkmark). Just like when you gamble with boxes.  At that point you cant complain. Just like you cant complain when you realize that opening boxes does not automatically give you the skin.

hm9pp4s,Padouch1038,11/27/2021,1,12.0,IMO Yes Vadimir is giga strong. He can do so much damage to basically the whole team.    I started playing him last season and can tell you that if you underestimate him in lane he can get you lvl 4 to lvl 6 easily with full combo.    His only downside which is good is taht he has limited range and spells cost HP.
hm9vdip,hiccup333,11/27/2021,1,12366.0,Totally totally agree.  I hate when resolution is dangled in front of you the whole season (the reconciliation of the sisters) then at the end its kicked to another season
hm94evh,Derk08,11/27/2021,1,28.0,Team Spica was absolutely trolling. Blabers team was playing serious while it sounded like Spicas team had 5 monkeys screaming into their headset lmao
hm9zz5t,delahunt,11/27/2021,1,12378.0,One of her inspirations is literally the Joker.  Her lock in line is Rules are made to be broken. Like buildings...or PEOPLE!   Shes an insane remorseless killing machine. Arcane so far is the story of how she got there. And I think we dont see the real birth of Jinx until she pulls the trigger on the SMDR at the end. Hence the tears. Shes crying for the final death of powder.
hmatdh1,Yetti2Quick,11/27/2021,1,305.0,That’s not the challenge. Lmfao. It’s just hitting challenger. Then he moves on and starts trolling cuz he already hit his goal.
hm8v5vz,yawnbaby,11/27/2021,1,50.0,Im sorry if I came off as attacking you but youre wrong about my motives. That wasnt my intention at all. I know what you think I am and that isnt me.   But I dont have to prove myself to a random redditor.  Right from the get-go you have created a conception of who you think I am and regardless of what was said stuck with that idea. The main POINT of my first comment to you was not to attack you not to put words in your mouth not to bash you for your opinions. It was to show you what I found and hear your thoughts on why you believe Arcane ruined Jinx in the first place. Yes the sentence containing the word hate was a mistake on my part and could definitely have been worded better however that is something I acknowledged and explained and it is something that couldnt have been further from the point being made.  Only I know my true motives and my true intentions. Again if I came off as someone trying to put words in your mouth I apologize. I truly have zero intention of attacking you and I feel like Ive repeated that time and time again. If you still cant see that and youre still stuck behind this pessimistic notion of me you created then godspeed.

hmaj0d8,Potential_Hornet_559,11/27/2021,1,375.0,Making things up?  He just told his side of the story.  He even say he doesn’t know what the situation was and that was his frustration.  From his point of view upset left without much explanation.  And I didnt see any directing his fans to harass Upset  or are you trying to make shit up about Adam?  Are you in Germany?  Maybe you could get sued.
hmb22yl,LoLrovex,11/27/2021,1,341.0,Q max is way better for wave clear and being able to help the map. I think your laning is strong enough that you dont need points in E to win it. E max is a thing of the past and people dont get cheesed by it anymore.
hmbk2dg,littlebridger420,11/27/2021,1,19.0,Dont think so but  my pick for NA would be Lux. I dont even enjoy playing the champ but shes possibly the most popular champ in low elo NA besides ADCs who have boosted pick rates and shes been popular on the server for a long while.
hm9zgxy,SaikaTheCasual,11/27/2021,1,36.0,It’s a perfectly fine comparison. It’s a lot more dramatic but that doesn’t matter. You disqualify someone from having a valid say in something depending on their performance.
hm9xxlc,KangarooChief,11/27/2021,1,6.0,Ive taken this into account (SJ for sejauni for example). Your two letter codes will return more than just akshan though.
hmbmyry,GiventoWanderlust,11/27/2021,1,12.0,Thats because the ratings arent how badass was your KDA its how well did you play compared to other people at your rank.  The vast majority of players are playing at a rank where people are pretty trash at CS which is almost always the answer when someone starts asking WHY NO S.
hmacbga,Joatorino,11/27/2021,1,83.0,Pta and hob were never nerfed for ranged and fleet got giga nerfed for melees last time they changed. Now it actually requires some skill instead of just being more lane sustain and its pretty good on ranged if you hit champions when you have the energized proc. Only rune that was nerfed for rangeds is conqueror which was never really a good choice on adcs
hmbpnbc,Z3r0D4Y_,11/27/2021,1,8.0,Cool!

hmavza3,ShadyGecko,11/27/2021,1,19.0,Makes sense thanks. Especially with more games going late.
hmblqg9,2soonexecutus,11/27/2021,1,19.0,>  first pick a juggernaut (Morde) The enemy team can pick Fiora Vayne or Trynd against me and I wont have fun.  I dont feel like Im destroying morde as trynda. In my last match he just builded bramble and I couldnt out-dmg him early-mid game. Later in the game ofc it was a different story.
hma91gs,cosHinsHeiR,11/27/2021,1,,Neither does kaisa W. Notice it only vs Kha tho.
hm9hpmd,GunnerPup13,11/27/2021,1,32.0,I have been getting into the battlefield a lot more recently. Especially with the amount of stupidity that call of duty has been running through the mail more recently. And I honestly enjoy battlefield a lot more than I thought I would. I’ve been playing call of duty since the very first one came out in 2003 so I guess it pains me a little more to see one call of duty fucks up because I’ve been an avid fan for so long. It’s kind of like watching league of legends for you. And you could say that I just need to wait for the bugs to get out of the new call of duty but the point is that I’m paying over $100 for this game because I love the series. I love the IP. The problem is that I’m watching a series that I fell in love with go into the shitter because people want to take it in so many directions. Nobody wants to have the balls to do anything new or exciting. It’s just the same stupidity over and over and over. And I guess you could call it more of being burnt out by the series but it just makes me so frustrated. I’m probably gonna take a break from call of duty for a little while depending on how the next game goes. If the next one is a lot more of the same stupidity I’m just gonna stop playing. And what kills me more than anything it’s people who play the games for even half of the amount of time that I have agree with me that call of duty has gone downhill but you have all these new players who are saying that the game is great. A lot of them are only looking at the game for the same reasons that I looked at it in the beginning. Without having any of the context. And I really wish that they would remaster world at war or one of those older games again. Mostly to show people how awesome the original call of duties that we grew up on were back in the day.
hma1ni5,D4RKEVA,11/27/2021,1,135.0,ig also improved over the course of the tournament...  and hint hint ig played kt closer to fnc in groups (where they went 1-2) than fnc in finals
hmbi94z,Khadaa,11/27/2021,1,303.0,> Bro I fucking main Fiora. I could give 0 shits about how Yone and Yas are doing because I can simply fuck them over with one ability the problem rn tho is that LT makes the cooldown for Q so small that they can beat anyone in a 1v1 duel at any stage as long as they are not behind.  This is hilarious to me because what you just described is available to Fiora at every stage of the game simply by the virtue of her kit. Yas/Yone need to at least select the proper rune setup that enables their early game. Man its funny getting some backstory on the idiots complaining about this. How about you dodge some of the Qs?

hmbo9ln,daswef2,11/27/2021,1,,Interestingly enough Jinx and Lucians highest winrate points are 15-20 minute games.  Their winrates plummet between 30-40 minutes until they recover ultralate.  Taking a look at the higher pickrate supports Thresh Leona Senna Nautilus Rakan Alistar Maokai Seraphine Braum Rell Yuumi Sona Zilean all have huge winrate spikes as the game goes later while looking at marksmen only Vayne Kaisa Miss Fortune Aphelios Samira Ezreal have significant increases in winrate as the game goes on (everyone else peaks around 20 minutes and then nosedives).  Depending on what marksman you are running unless that marksman is immediately popping off and you are playing through them to end early Id make the argument that you are better off getting your support ahead or unlocked.  There are way more viable mid/late game powerful supports that you can accelerate into their strongest points while theres a significantly lower amount of upward curving marksmen.  I think we are perhaps underrating the strategy of getting our supports big and overrating the value of marksmen vs the amount of resources they require.
hmbqk7r,DHSUAUGEV,11/27/2021,1,326.0,The biggest adc killer was 8.11. in 8.11 they fucked over adc stats super hard. They ruined their early game for that item update that was supposed to give them a really good late that they could never achieve since their stats were so bad. The only adc they didnt touch was Quinn because they obviously forgot since she doesnt play bot lane. Every adc was terrible after that but not Quinn.   Quinn was playing bot and beating everyone. Even the mages that replaced bot for that season. She was able to actually make it out of the early game and get to these new Great late game crit items. She was nerfed a patch or two later I dont remember.   After these stat nerfs as well adcs got replaced by mages. Riot then said they intended for that to be a thing to create more diversity. Which makes no since most adcs except for vayne and Lucian cant solo lane. So adcs were literally not picked ever. So they were obviously lying so they didnt have to go back on the adc update  Along with these stat nerfs adcs lost a lot of early agency as well (part of the reason mages replaced them) and the laning relies more on your support than ever.   Then I think the next pre season they kicked them while they were already down and did the DUO LANE XP NERFS. earlier they made it so adcs need levels to scale and then they made it even harder to get levels.   Now here we are with adcs being super mediocre. They can be pretty good if the adc and support have synergy otherwise you are just something to kill.   As well as this cringe ass crown item thats being abused in all 3 lanes.

hm95icd,alajet,11/27/2021,1,30.0,369 is still 20 and at his best performance one of the best carries in the league. If JDG are rebuilding he is one of the better pieces they can get back in exchange for their veteran top laner.
hmboyyd,MorningRaven,11/27/2021,1,3.0,Honestly I loved all of these (really surprised they didnt bring Nexus Siege back. It already uses Rift as a set up). I hate playing pretty much any of the ones they actually give us now and would trade any of them (even urf) for the chance to play these again.  I can certainly see why Odyssey is winning. The augments were creative and fun and a PvE gamemode is so needed. Though the game mode really burnt me out on hearing odyssey skin sound effects. Having 5 Yasuos all throwing out 8 tornados at a time does that to you (I do miss Missile Trail Jinx though. Shes fun as a caster). And the meta pretty quickly made sure you had Yasuo and Jinx and might not even need Malph Ziggs or Sona.  But that overkill is why I preferred Star Guardian Invasion. You were capped at one person per champion with 10 champs to pick from instead of 6 repeating. The missions were also a lot of fun trying to make unique teamcomps like beating the mode without using marksmen or the only support you could use was Poppy as a tank no enchanters. You could get really creative with real builds from League to make it work. Like having someone else do crit or mages focus on a burn dps build. Or Athenes allowing you to heal those you shield and that allowed enchanter Lux to support when you couldnt have Lulu Janna or Soraka.  Im still waiting for those void invader skins. *Riot*. Let me melt my enemies with the Velkoz laser reminiscent of those from that damn hallway I spent so much time in.

hm9hbt0,Noman_Blaze,11/27/2021,1,389.0,Its no different in LOL. Even with server lock no one is stopping people from speaking their native language. I play in EUW and every other game there is a player speaking their native language. That person is overexagerating. I play in EUW and EUE as well as in South East Asian servers in Dota and majority of the times people do speak English. Its not that common to get someone who only speaks their native language.   You can select English as your preferred language and only match with players who have selected the same. I guess that guy doesnt know this.

Because if this man left his team 12 hours before the biggest tourny of their lives they have worked towards all year to go home and play 6 arams a day with his GF then nahhhhhhhh fuck that.

hmb2u1b,Chivibro,11/27/2021,1,8.0,You can party up with people and hope someone gets an S. Getting an S will get you chests which can have champion shards. Buting champions from Champion Shards will be cheaper than buting them from the store. Also you can Disenchant shards to get BE from them. Itll take a little while but thats the best way to get BE atm.  There are events that happen every once in a while that have Tokens and come with their own little shops. In those shops you can always buy Champ Shards and itll be guaranteed to be a decently priced one. Those Champ Shards are by far the best way to get BE

Make it a full-day concert with intermissions and just play EVERYTHING theyve made over the years from Warriors (I know thats by ID) to DJ Sona to Pentakill K/DA TD all the Worlds songs all the champion themes to Arcane.  Itll be a music festival.

hmbjdn2,TitanDweevil,11/27/2021,1,13.0,>The dodge penalty is questionable enough due to the omnipresence of players who are supremely unpleasant in low rank play and the numerous accounts higher rank players tend to have.  That dodge penalty was put in place to stop people from dodging every time they got an unfavorable match up or their team comp looked worse in order to climb.  From personal experience it was a massive problem in high elo there was a decent amount of people who would dodge every time the game looked tough.  This inflated the queue times and it also allowed people to climb to a much higher rank than their actual skill due to abusing dodges.    >Make counter-picking less decisive so that people no longer feel like dodging a bad draft is necessary.  The whole point of the change was to stop people dodging bad drafts or tough match ups.  Draft is part of the game.  Some champions arent safe blind picks and if your team blind picks it and gets countered then Im sorry to say it but tough luck.  If you are scared of getting counter picked then pick a safe champion or ask for a swap.  If you dont play any safe champions or cant get a swap then learn how to manage the match up.  The match ups arent unplayably impossible like season 2 Pantheon vs Gangplank there is always something you can do especially considering completely ignoring lane and roaming around the map fighting is a viable solo queue strategy still (somehow this hasnt been nerfed after 3 years).  Most of the time you arent playing with the same people in low elo so Im almost certain that the unpleasant people you are referring to would be people who play champions you consider bad or off meta.  This change was made to stop people from dodging in those cases in order to climb faster so if you are upset that you cant do it anymore without getting punished then its working as intended.

hmbklza,RaiseYourDongersOP,11/27/2021,1,113.0,Even if he had good stats no one was rating him top 3 mid. Hes middle of the pack. Either way Im not trying to say ABO is shit just that looking at the teams DLs team is the weakest at least from what I can tell.  Team DL: Doublelift middle of the pack LCS mid soloQ star top (no idea how it will translate to something like this) Academy jungler academy support who was shit in LCS and one DL has critiqued a lot lol   Team CoreJJ: Dont even really need to say much here CoreJJ and Bwipo already make this the best team. Armao isnt really that good imo but he has a lot of experience.   Team Blaber: Blaber mid who has LCS experience Danny (rising adc talent) Zeyzal who has a lot of LCS experience   Team Spica: Dhokla (LCS experience) Spica Tactical not sure about the rest of them. I guess you could maybe argue this team is the worst but I think strong jungle/strong adc/experienced top is better than inexperienced top/decent mid/strong adc/meh support imo. It could be different though obviously because I dont really know the players from Academy and the other young players.

hmbn5eu,ionux,11/27/2021,1,326.0,look at the bright side  adcs can abuse items/runes from other classes too  conqueror from bruiser  frozen heart/randuin  etc
hma919y,ShogunKing,11/27/2021,1,,Its also worth noting that Doublelift had a...tense relationship with his family to start with. It helps when you know the context to a given situation instead of just blindly comparing things.
hmb9we5,HuntedWolf,11/27/2021,1,52.0,Jaques?
hmbngdk,ColdXStrikeR,11/27/2021,1,170.0,Ohhh yeah except that it never fucking works as intended does it? Sometimes it executes as low as 10%. You can find a shit ton of examples online. My point is no1 wanted elder every1 said it was gonna be broken. They put it in nerfed it and its still shit tonplay against
hmblw1s,androt14_,11/27/2021,1,,Ever seen Ryze and Faker on the same room at the same time?  yeah thats what I thought Faker and Ryze are the same person
hmbok2z,100WattCrusader,11/27/2021,1,170.0,Ah okay makes more sense my fault. Not trying to be defensive just got a bad tone sometimes. I get you though
hmbm23v,DooMLerD,11/27/2021,1,456.0,Thats true man
hmbq0mn,Maloonyy,11/27/2021,1,156.0,Not as bad as the annoying switch sound the winter skin of hers has. CHOO CHOO
hmantmz,fnlbss,11/27/2021,1,12404.0,The other chem barons in the lore are old as shit and much more of a threat than silco was him only having two facilities so if arcanes just truly retconning them all away that means Zac and Mundo are also going to be retconned quite heavily.  Not to mention Warwick lost pretty much his whole Plot. The dog literally exists to kill the chem barons. If those guys around the table were the chem barons hes going to complete his story pretty quickly.  I edited the original post cause this is getting annoying.
hmbodkf,Whoui,11/27/2021,1,1412.0,Didnt think that someone would pist in this anymore. You are right master yi makes my blood boil

hmbnksc,seventinnine,11/27/2021,1,170.0,Just had a game where the enemy samira with collector made a quadra and everyone killed by her didnt get the soul 2nd life.
hmbqdju,DupreeWasTaken,11/27/2021,1,326.0,You would think its great... but it really doesnt feel all that great tbh.   Talking from a kindred OTP basically though the stats feel like such absolute shit compared to Conq or even PTA that it just doesnt feel right. And Kindred essentially has an auto reset on a low CD they should stack it quickly but it just doesnt feel good.   Kindred should feel good with that extra range with stacks too. But again numbers are just shit.
hmblfr3,ozmega,11/27/2021,1,156.0,in a league of legends eye it is a really interesting subject early league of legends would use a lot of garen for promotional stuff teemo maybe kata? at some point you would have told me lux and id say yeah lorewise we got ryze but i think jinx will be the first league character to break into mainstream media i mean she already went turbo

hmbmar2,PlotShield,11/27/2021,1,172.0,Can you fix sound problems? Almost every game there is a problem with sounds not playing for example abilities wards champion talking to player etc…  Reconnecting fixes these sometimes but not always
hmblhec,GalaxySmash,11/27/2021,1,172.0,Thank you :D
hm8z2yi,Psychout40,11/27/2021,1,,To be fair they also intended Juggernauts to primarily buy health as a defensive tool not resistances. This feels like one of the cases where you’re opting into something less efficient due to it being niche.

hmbl9if,bobandgeorge,11/27/2021,1,,That depends if you think 4% is enough of a difference. Out of 100 games in which a soul is taken 87 of them will result in the team with the soul winning. Is it really that much more OP that 4 more of those games were a result of Chemtech soul?
hmblz2v,lemonrabbits,11/27/2021,1,156.0,Ryze is Dr. Manhattan confirmed
hmblcut,sp33dzer0,11/27/2021,1,326.0,Ashe hasnt auto built hurricane for awhile. She used to BEFORE the mythic update but now its a 4th item at best.

hm98t3b,imusuallyawkward,11/27/2021,1,150.0,Because ppl obviously dont care abt in game ranks and your friends might not be relate to the rank you attain as a form of life achievement. And because there is league community that you can share this news with ofc you can get more response. Do ranks matters tbh lol
hmblalj,GoldeN_FalcoN,11/27/2021,1,11.0,Probably dating myself here but I remember seeing your original piece back then! I still have it saved because I liked it so much and now I have the modern version as well! Awesome work!
hmahuof,OverkillOrange,11/27/2021,1,23.0,it got removed because it made lv 6 dives too safe. Are people getting soul at lv 6?
hmbl7sx,lawfulkitten1,11/27/2021,1,639.0,Top / support champs are fine. Nautilus and Jax jungle arent meta but I think theyre playable. Mid Zyra isnt very good shes pretty much only played as support now.
hmaxn4r,caspet11,11/27/2021,1,1.0,My settings were almost completely reset only like 1/3 of my keybinds were still the same.
hm98qxj,ThatTeapot,11/27/2021,1,6.0,Mid can be really influencial if you are good at it
hmbmrc4,AaronDeath,11/27/2021,1,113.0,I dont think spica’s olaf comment is a mentality thing. He’s very vocal about not liking olaf and DL says all the time that he hated the champion.
hmbl1ku,WarchiefSnorlax,11/27/2021,1,,You sound like such a smartass. Too stupid to know why thatd be a good thing. If no one wants the current skins and they opened that points shop obviously thered be a reason to save them jackass.
hmbq6de,Darkin_Soap,11/27/2021,1,9.0,because you stack mr and magic resists and its not like most of tanks has more hp late game with full builds than bruisers
hm9qsz1,ElBigDicko,11/27/2021,1,419.0,Because if you assume that every Nordic+Eastern EU player plays on EUNE most lol pros would be there its just that people left.   People didnt escape the server just that the split was done shittly initially. I was there when it happened and I got  EUW meanwhile my friend who lived literally next door got put in EUNE.   Nowdays people dont escape just that when someone is good there is a chance for showing it on EUW.
hmbeijo,salcedoge,11/27/2021,1,174.0,Yeah its pretty hard to feel bad to Nuguri here since he went to get paid only to give poor effort
hmboazq,chineseduckman,11/27/2021,1,,Lol you think I give a shit about tsm shitting themselves I couldnt care less for the past 3 years Im well aware of how dogshit they are. Regardless get ready to watch this TL shit on EU this MSI and worlds. Its gonna be great.

hmb8ic6,SocialistScissors,11/27/2021,1,15.0,Its pretty good on anivia. She is able to expend mana at a fast enough rate to feel the impact of the healing. In general it feels like it was changed to better suit mana hungry battle mages like her.
hma932d,ADeadMansName,11/27/2021,1,3976.0,How was an entire year of work thrown away? He worked mostly to improve. And it was not like Adam or Bwipo or anyone on FNC had really tried their best to still make it. They were mentally totally destroyed when they actually had a decent chance with Bean to make it further.  So saying it was just Upset and not also a problem with the rest of the team ignored their whole performance.  FNCs goal that year wasnt to win worlds that was nearly impossible. They likely could have made semis with Upset if everything went well and with Bean quarterfinals if everything went well. Not like Upset leaving was removing everything. Not like Upset leaving removed everything they learned together that year.  It did stipp them from a better chance of a higher placement at worlds that is all.  And I dont wonder why he is pissed. But shit happens. You think Upset wanted to have an emergency? You cant blame Upset for that. Shit happened happens all the time move on after letting it out. But dont be pissed random people. Yes it is human like but it is also wrong.
hm9jgmj,shineyumbreon,11/27/2021,1,196.0,Well tbf you dont know that there is nothing wrong with him. There are plenty of people that are stuck in iron/bronze because they have a disability of some form be it physical or mental. Of course there is nothing wrong with that.   Spending around 5000 hours on a single champion and still not making it even close to rank of the average player definitely makes it sound like there is in fact  something wrong with the player.

hmahuk6,edgelordweeb_,11/27/2021,1,87.0,No it doesnt you listed eight mids which puts him at the exact middle of the league and Creme isnt playing next split anyways so Yagao hits 8th putting him at upper half.
hmbex62,phizmeister,11/27/2021,1,4.0,Oh now I see. But whats the point for the missions then if I can spend the same amount directly in the store to buy the champion?  Edit: Never mind seems that the unlock didnt cost me anything.

hmb9lw4,WolverineKing,11/27/2021,1,38.0,If it truly is just what was in the video I doubt most players would not have an issue. Do you really think you can get 10-12 people  have them work/live together for most of the year and have no conflict? Sometimes a good wake-up call is what is needed and sometimes the coach needs to sit and listen. It is all part of the job. Go look at any of the other examples of coaching in European soccer or American football and you will see this is not some rare Eastern only method.
hmaub0d,Agreeable_Junket_271,11/27/2021,1,31.0,the issue is that in NA its often the case that the coach has a much worse understanding of the game than the players so this respect doesnt exist like it does in the east at least if doublelift is to be believed. we know the coaching in 2020 tsm was very laissez-faire with DL and Bjergsen making the big decisions

hma3y5e,bearugh,11/27/2021,1,9.0,I am so confused and genuinely curious what the hell you mean by vi replaced by sett.  Also I played hearthstone for 6ish years and riots shit or lack of content is nothing compared to hearths drip feed of dog shit patches nerfing decks no one wanted nerfed and not nerfing the most broken hangouts shit for 6 months.  Like at gala shaman or even evolve rabbit shaman with they did the weird lets have random willd cards on standard for a few months. They actually just made ranked so unplayable that the numbers actually plumited.

hmbfpwp,RedZoomTV,11/27/2021,1,5.0,I just did a quick test in the practice tool:     It seems that different pings have different timers. Some pings Ive counted to take 45 seconds if you constantly spam them and 25 WHOLE SECONDS if you dont touch it since the ping mute. This is very disturbing and I feel like if riot was not going to change this we should at least have knowledge of when we can ping again! It can just be a small timer on the screen in a corner somewhere with an icon of a ping and a timer :)

hmbn7rv,Rengar_Is_Good_kitty,11/27/2021,1,326.0,I find it silly that Riot keeps breaking things that have limits/caps for a reason game is balanced around champions having an attack speed cap or a set  attack range specifically for that champion and several other things wish theyd stop doing that fucks with balance every time causing nerfs/reworks.  With that being said to call it abused by melee is nonsense how about Hail of Blades being abused by ADCs? Double standards huh...  Melees dont have a good option for attack speed theres Hail of Blades which is mostly just an assassin keystone that also happens to be abused by ADCs (See I can do that too) but nothing else nothing wrong with making Lethal Tempo something that melees can use as well as ranged the problem is the way they did it range increase should be completely removed its ridiculous that a Jinx can attack you from across the fucking realm or an Irelia who already has bullshit attack range being able to get it even higher.  It should be an attack speed keystone and nothing else get rid of the stupid attack range and rebalance the attack speed.  Also worth mentioning that Riot has nerfed Conqueror a million times (But still refuses to remove the shitty healing) so its not surprising that Conqueror users are looking for something else to use.  > oposit  Opposite*

hma7pfl,Anarchontologist,11/27/2021,1,29.0,>He wont talk at all.  Called it 100 times over on this sub before and during Worlds that this dude wasnt talking at all. It was so obvious.   First Ill just say this dude is a trash teammate if this is how he handles adversity in sports. No budging on this. If you ever played sports in any solid organized level - it is _never_ about you and your tantrums. It is 100% all buy in. And throw your body into the gears to win.   Second this dude might have an actual social/personality problem if this is the way he handles shit in a professional career.   Third when awkward ass Video Game Kids need to be social to execute as a team and they cant do it - and the teammates and staff cant get them to operate as a PROFESSIONALLY PAID player... This sport is a fucking Clown Town.  Sucks for FPX because they had an awesome roster.  But this dude sounds like he has a severe social problem. Id never want this dude on my team. I dont give a fuck how good he is. Gimgoon won a title at lesser skill because he operates as a teammate _better_ in FPX.

hmaq0g9,boostedben1,11/27/2021,1,98.0,They arent quiet people FPX is known for being a noisy team. The team has tried to integrate Nuguri you can see that in their stream moments and Nuguri would also talk about the members sometimes on stream. But after Spring it kind of disappeared. Both sides probably gave up on each other but the FPX members tried harder than Nuguri tried. You can see times where Crisp and Tian try talking to him. All the FPX members also would heavily defend Nuguri on stream during Summer when he would get flamed for his performance and his PUBG addiction

hma2eu9,delahunt,11/27/2021,1,12388.0,Do they though? I mean really how did the girl with the penchant for making bombs being raised by the second hardest crime boss to ever crime (behind Vander) end up a cold-blooded killer? It couldnt have anything to do with going from trauma to trauma to well make them all burn as her daddy right?  As for Ekko it makes sense. He knows Vi is going to save Vander with Mylo/Claggor. There is an explosion. Vi Vander Claggor Mylo are all gone...and Jinx is now living with Silco as his daughter. What probably happened is Ekko thought they were all dead for a bit and then later finds Jinx and knows it is powder. Hell its possible him realizing Powder is Jinx happens on the airship raid. But either way he knows Jinx is working for Silco.
hmagnr4,DifferentHorse,11/27/2021,1,26.0,No problem friend it was all clear.   Exactly why is it in low elo that everyone trash talks and blames each other. If I was that good I wouldnt be playing with them would I? And if they were good they wouldnt be playing with me would they?

hmauw8x,gothsole,11/27/2021,1,2.0,the replays you can view in client are only valid for the patch theyre played on sadly  the best way to permanently save replays is to record them via something like OBS. its not perfect - you dont get all the spectator controls you normally have - but its good for saving highlights or rewatching your games later to look for things you can improve on

hmazzr9,CoogiMonster,11/27/2021,1,,This is actually a bad take… Sion loses any additional range and ability with his zombie state and becomes a glorified tibbers.  An ADC or assassin (that is still over killing enemies effectively making the damage drop off minor) is still insane.  I’ve had chemtech over hextech soul in 8 of my 10 games this preseason and it’s had some kind of dumb outcomes to games with people just ignoring fights and Sion inting/ending as their zombie up to me getting a Quadra kill with 2 kills coming in zombie state.  This soul is by far stronger than any other soul and it’s not close but that’s why it’s preseason.  If it shipped live like this then every chemtech game will undoubtedly be decided by who gets soul and that’s it.

hma4t5q,tanezuki,11/27/2021,1,76.0,I agree with how stupidly easy itd make the Vanguards apply it. Though ADCs can also apply it very easily (3 aas with Mortal Reminder ?).  Then how about just keeping the first condition  of 40% and adding a 50% max HP threshold like Morello or Chempunk instead of the CC condition.
hm9esc1,Prestonwww,11/27/2021,1,17.0,I definitely had my moments with it. I wasnt trying to make it sad really but thank you for reading nonetheless.
hma3j46,FennecOwO,11/27/2021,1,203.0,Youre not taking your lane matchup into account. Reading the map will let you play out your matchup correctly.  As an example you saw Lee Bot as a Toplaner so you know you roughly have atleast a minute without any jungle intervention. Depending on your matchup you could then setup the lane for an all in or push in the wave for free tempo. If your jungler is there you could setup a dive or try baiting your opponent for a gank.   Their jungler being on the opposite part of the map is just 1 piece of the puzzle to how to play the next minute in advance you need to check where all the other pieces are too (i.e. your junglers position or maybe theres a deep ward bot which you can use to turn a gank around with tp) and understand your matchup. Its not as arbitrary as: I see jungler bot I slowpush.  As a general rule you shouldnt be starting anything aggressive in your lane unless you know your jungler has your side of the map covered see their jungler bot or you can 2v1 them even though sometimes its more nuanced than that.

Not sure how this is so unbalanced. I think DL is comparable to a lot of current pros so I put him in there and it fits perfectly. Also I assumed players Im not very familiar with are young a couple of them might be old washed players but that probably puts them close to young academy players who have little to no experience.

hmbhwz8,nitko87,11/27/2021,1,303.0,I like new LT. It feels like Conqueror but with attack speed instead of AD and doesn’t have lifesteal. It’s good for champs that wanna stick to you and you can still stop those champs with cc. It’s really not as problematic as people make it out to be players just don’t draft well around it.  It’s easy to say a champ that uses LT is broken with the rune when they stomp a volatile matchup but these champs still have counters

hm9qa6s,Alarming_Beginning_1,11/27/2021,1,,This girl fits her body type a little better  https://www.tiktok.com/@emiru/video/7035034718122888453?_t=8NhR8Ntpe8d&_r=1
hmazuqd,LoLrovex,11/27/2021,1,341.0,Thank you! I offered coaching in the past and might just bring it back again for s12. Typically I tried to coach only diamond+ because I felt players under that had so much access to free content to improve. But anyone will coach anyone  given the right amount.
hmb3t7w,PokeD2,11/27/2021,1,157.0,Good
hmbeczs,LegInfinite245,11/27/2021,1,6.0,Arcane has ruined my mind to the point where I can no longer consume any media without feelings its immediate inferiority. It makes me want to run on a screaming rampage tearing down the vain works of man that line or halls and museums--all merely flickering shadows cast on a caves wall in the light of arcane. Michelangelo Da Vinci Van Gogh Shakespeare... What you can artists I would call merely the road-builders the forebearers... They established the traditions that Arcane would one day perfect. Art is dead expression is finished as it has in a way completed its original purpose. We are done and now we may retire as a single post-enlightenment culture.

hmahtol,Fun_Carrot6597,11/27/2021,1,215.0,It’s fair to says that the LCS orgs are more knowledgeable that Tilterino247 and they will not touch DL. I imagine that’s a combination of his terrible attitude (spring doesn’t matter wah wah wah) drama queen tendencies horrendously embarrassing world’s performance (not just 2020 (suiciding to Viktor as Lucian)) and lack of recent practice.   I find the fact that this NA ‘goat’ was not offered a spot on a single LCS team.
hmbo21x,metamet,11/27/2021,1,588.0,Maybe today. But compared to any mainstream rock from mid 2010s and before theyre very much experimental.  Im not a fan of them but theyre definitely better than the majority of mainstream rock in the last 20 years.
hmarvxv,EfficientAstronaut1,11/27/2021,1,199.0,they didnt chose larssen but chose the lowest buyout out of the 3... you know what i mean
hmagk3z,HostJoyner,11/27/2021,1,79.0,He had a very humble beginning clearly he sympathetic towards those who are struggling to find their footing in the LPL
hma6xgf,BalfAlf,11/27/2021,1,440.0,I am Danish and Danes are really bad as well. Idiots are everywhere  But a polish jg is the worst  My top 3 of mutes  1. Polish junglers (any champ) 2. Frensh Dravens 3. Premates (one much better than the other. The bad one is ADC)
hm9wk7v,miggly,11/27/2021,1,32.0,The only thing I have against them is that not everyone knows about them. If literally everyone uses them thats cool but a lot dont. So because some people get extra info others are inherently at a disadvantage.  They should just be in the game though. Would be easier.
hmb2cgk,Toplaners,11/27/2021,1,341.0,Oh yeah.  If Im against an autofilled top I dont care what champion theyre playing theyre going to make small mistakes like using an ability at the wrong time and I will snowball off it.  If I lose a game where Im against an autofill I know its my fault regardless of how the game is going for my team because I know I should be able to carry with my lead.
hm9yc4r,tanezuki,11/27/2021,1,70.0,Gargoyle is good against burst and Force of Nature is a magic resistance item.   Death Dance makes you way too squishy and isnt a juggernaut item.   Ill always build Randuin because its literaly the only viable armor item I can build Frozen Heart misses HP and Thornmail is not exploitable.
hma7zx9,MrZeral,11/27/2021,1,593.0,And you still gotta spend orange essence for that right?
hmaa10d,WE-Draz,11/27/2021,1,83.0,I never said 50 range was nothing though?  50 range almost double melee champs Whereas 100 while awesome is nothing comparable.  Arent we arguing for the same thing ? Im saying the rune is busted for melee while only usable for ranged champions.  Also adcs range matter a lot in lane yes but the rune only trigger after 6 autoattacks. There is absolutely no movement/pressure game around minions at this point since you are dead or they are dead.  The rune feels useless in lane outside of some wonky tank support matchup where you can stack it before fighting the enemy adc. 5% per auto is a joke.
hmbon46,Calenhir,11/27/2021,1,156.0,To me Viego feels like someone who thinks he is the worlds main character and when confronted with the fact that he isnt he threw the biggest hissy fit of all times.

hm9ai4d,AalfredWilibrordius,11/27/2021,1,41.0,Imagine healing for 7.8% of Sions health bar every time you hit him with an auto but its premitigation and pre-bramble but you also dont even need to get in a range where sion can do anything back  Thank the Lord this game isnt solely balanced by ADC players

hm9ya86,Rexsaur,11/27/2021,1,53.0,old LT was better on like every adc except for like vayne (mainly because old LT was garbage on vayne).

hm9ejvo,Raynar7,11/27/2021,1,15.0,No…why? Person on the other side doesn’t know your skin color….  Growing up means realising that world will never be perfect and only thing you can do is to be sure to be a good yourself since that’s the only person you can influence.
hmbasev,FlyingLotus_Beats,11/27/2021,1,10.0,yeah if you play seriously then statistically youll have less unserious players on your team and youll win more. its the easiest time to climb anyways so why not?
hmb2xb9,violue,11/27/2021,1,73.0,After playing on the site I think the app does some image searches as it renders.
hmb7llc,TOKYO-SLIME,11/27/2021,1,2.0,Dodged a game with a Caitlyn mid client bugged out when I tried to close it it opened an entirely new blank client had to force close that one and I got hit with an ELEVEN hour queue delay upon requeuing...   IT WASNT EVEN A SECOND DODGE T_T
hm9c652,Raynar7,11/27/2021,1,27.0,How dare you? Everybody knows the moment Tencent buys the company they take over day do day business first and everything else later. They are not doing it just to collect cheques and get game rights for China.  /s
hma6oij,robogloop,11/27/2021,1,145.0,which is absurd for him to do since he didn’t even play at worlds
hmb5ied,Uhloy,11/27/2021,1,3.0,Eh its a 50/50. Either you get the hardcore try-hard pre-season players or the who cares its pre-season players. In the end its your choice to take that risk.
hma4gnz,D4v26,11/27/2021,1,83.0,Yes Im sure I also thought it would be available today but no it will be a long 3 days :(

hm97jmt,Xonra,11/27/2021,1,170.0,Alphari literally made jokes and accidentally confirmed Upset did in fact approach him in response to Adams twittlonger (this was before Upset claimed Alphari approached him).
hmboxat,Halseyqueen,11/27/2021,1,122.0,Thank you for mentioning this she does not have reddit as I said so it is another Redditor posting in thankfully they did give credit to her in the post
hm9pwym,curbedddd,11/27/2021,1,175.0,Who asked?
hmajl8h,MozzyZ,11/27/2021,1,441.0,People have speculated its around 6-7 years here https://www.reddit.com/r/arcane/comments/qwucam/how_long_is_the_time_skip_from_ep_3_to_4/  Apparently theres a world record holder for teen with longest hair which was a 16 yr old girl https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2018/12/real-life-rapunzel-meet-the-teenager-with-the-worlds-longest-hair-551997  Might not be entirely impossible!
hmb27hn,DoYouMindIfIAsk_,11/27/2021,1,530.0,ive seen about 5 cosplays of jinx some def look more like the arcane jinx than her.  still well done or whatever.
hmaa2p8,chineseduckman,11/27/2021,1,311.0,Lol what Bwipo went to NA this year because he landed on a great fucking roster. The TL roster looks like it could easily challenge any of the LEC rosters. Of course he didnt take the 800k to play on fucking DIG or GGS or whoever offered
hm9v8by,SoundWavingSleeper,11/27/2021,1,207.0,Always just the lazy dismissal of stats whenever they are mentioned.  Wish you would have at least tried to use your brain when reading/responding than regurgitating the same thing you can read 50 times in any thread about jensen lately.
hmba3ai,Sooap,11/27/2021,1,40.0,Why? Its free extra gold. Saving Pyke ult sounds dumb.

hmb87ln,PurplePotato_,11/27/2021,1,163.0,They can pin this on Nuguri all they want but Nuguri didnt make Lwx and Crisp take turns inting when it mattered most (for example in both finals and at worlds) nor did he cause Tians health problems and Bos scandal.
hmaf3fc,Palin_Sees_Russia,11/27/2021,1,,Then why did you say “when did they LOSE its cringe”? Shit is still incredibly cringe.
hm9u73y,MysticSkies,11/27/2021,1,288.0,You should take a look at Emirus cosplay if you think this is as close as it gets.
hm9ftgb,Obrejiklea,11/27/2021,1,17.0,god damn this dude wrote a whole ass BOOK
hmb8h9p,EvyLuna,11/27/2021,1,354.0,Yes because Master and Grandmaster made it easier to climb Diamond. D1 used to have a major skill disparity between 0LP and 99LP. The gap would mostly be affected there but the principle still holds to a relative level.
hm9g397,Far-Abroad8185,11/27/2021,1,33.0,Lmfao and why should any of us give a fuck about their profits? I dont work there they can go bankrupt for all i care. Just stop being lazy and make the god damn map.
hma30c8,howtopayherefor,11/27/2021,1,,>How do you implement adaptive stat conversion that gives the player the stat they want without letting them choose the stat directly? It doesn’t seem feasible nor reasonable if you include HP  You know by only counting a % of bonus HP. Roughly 13% should do the trick. Maybe 20%.  >Can you imagine if Mordekaiser could build a cost efficient Liandry + Frozen Heart  Its not gold efficient: I used a 50% conversion rate. Frozen Heart has 560 gold worth of mana on Mordekaiser that would only be 280 gold to be converted into HP or AP. His stats with Liandrys would be worse than with a AP+HP mage mythic.  Liandrys (or other AP+mana mythics) on Vlad would give him \~150 HP instead of 600 mana (+5 AP from his passive). Thats half of what the other AP+HP mythics give him (300 HP -> +10 AP). He would actually scale worse. If Liandrys gave him AP hed get 19.3 AP -> 30 extra HP from his passive. Broken?  Tell me how ridiculous Rumbles numbers would get. If hes not buying Frozen Heart or Zekes the only difference would be that he can buy a mana mythic that gives him 19.3 AP rather than a non-mana mythic that provides 300 HP. How is that game breaking?  Did you put any thought into this? You keep saying imagine how broken X would be if they got... but when I calculate how that would work in practice its actually not at all broken. The conversions are really gold inefficient but those items are still just good enough to be worth considering.
hma4x9h,xXUtahraptorXx,11/27/2021,1,372.0,The amount of people in these comments who suddenly became full-time cosplay critics for this one post is crazy. Like I stg if I had a dollar for every time someone said “hEr BoObs ArE TOo biG sO UnREaLiStiC” I’d probably have close to $20  The community is why the game will never improve
hm8u6vy,LoLrovex,11/27/2021,1,182.0,haha no problem and thank you. It takes a lot of work and persistence but it does seem easy once youve got all the skills to do it.
hm9lp89,CoachGiveAdvice,11/27/2021,1,8.0,Let the players rest ffs. Imagine mad lion players. Started in January with scrims and LEC and never stoping til mid October. And you want them to play in December ? Give them a break. Some contract aren’t sign yet and not even approved by riot. Half if not more would decline participating just like All Star

hm9zx7t,mogadichu,11/27/2021,1,21.0,I exaggerated a bit for dramatic effect but picking up a couple of objectives will make a hyper-carry about 400 gold richer than they would be last patch which can be absolutely massive since they usually start outscaling you at around two items.
hmbaz72,blacksocksonly,11/27/2021,1,125.0,played a game where enemy had Chemtech Soul + Fed Akshan and it felt like a tower defense constantly killing zombies and they revive and come back with GA then come back as zombies again. It was fun but it was impossible to win. I mostly think its about the time in-between revival that can be adjusted. its almost like a free zhonya everytime they die.
hm9odk5,Karukos,11/27/2021,1,173.0,Fair :P

hmajvxx,zNYNz,11/27/2021,1,6.0,something being exclusive to a particular region is hardly new
hmaanhc,Accomplished_Ad_2321,11/27/2021,1,313.0,I dont even get your point. My grandfather passed away while I was at work. I work with a small team of people. Do you think I just dashed past my co-workers without saying a word and left? No. I informed them that something bad had happened with my grandfather and then left.  See in real life where professionalism is actually required of you muh privacy is not a valid reason for anything.  In fact I was just gone for half a day imagine having to leave my co-workers for weeks during the hardest period of the year without any explanation because I didnt trust them? What the hell does that even mean?   In what profession do you think its okay for you to just leave for weeks let alone leave without saying anything to your team?
hm9nvob,usuckusuckusuckusuck,11/27/2021,1,6.0,As a user it would be great but I can understand why they dont do it from a businessstandpoint.  Sadly I dont own many of the skins I would love a Chroma for and now Im debating if I just buy the skins or hope for some RNG luck to buy them next year.
hma85bq,BahLo-,11/27/2021,1,145.0,Couldnt distract yourself with your team and worlds?
hmb5rie,Cosmic-Warper,11/27/2021,1,206.0,??? You said their winrates massively increased... Their winrates stayed identical overall from 11.22 to 11.23 and their LT winrates stayed the same. Youre factually wrong
hmaswal,toshiroryuuzaki,11/27/2021,1,,No she wasn’t mediocre before—she was quite strong and had a really good win rate. She was just not being played that much. This buff was just too much for an already good champ.
hmbh3zk,Midusias,11/27/2021,1,2.0,YES arcane ost is amazing!! I was kinda giving up on doing covers consistently on youtube until Arcane came out.
hma393v,LeThomsen,11/27/2021,1,149.0,Have you seen the interview with Yamato? If not see it :) I think it says it all.  And ofc his teammates is bummed out by this would be surprised if they werent.  But I think a personal matter is more important than competition at any time and yes it would be nice to know what it all was about so we all can go Ooooh thats why he went home okay I get it now. I dont think one simply take a decision so lightly.
hmbj12b,Toplaners,11/27/2021,1,154.0,Imagine if aatrox still had his revive this preseason built GA had a zilean and got this soul.  Hed have 4 revives lmao.

hmb019g,EmpressHydra,11/27/2021,1,,Free shipping prime video gaming benefits for LoL that would cost me more than 7 dollars if i bought them outright for $7 > buying a $7 skin and calling it a day
hm9qm5o,SylerTheSK,11/27/2021,1,175.0,There were some rumors that Hans and Inspired wanted to replace Odo and Larssen management didnt agree so the 2 of them dipped.
hman2xk,Bobson_411,11/27/2021,1,8.0,If youre asking how he gets feast stacks he chose chogath R on ultimate spellbook and last hit champions and minions with it. If you mean how many feast stacks he has 10. You can see it at the bottom left corner
hm9b7al,hiekrus,11/27/2021,1,27.0,I dont think they will give away free anything that may potentially make them money in the future. If they make a free winter map now it makes it harder for them to demand money for map skins later. Im not saying they are planning to sell map skins in the future but just the possibility of them is enough.

hmb81wl,tautckus1,11/27/2021,1,411.0,A team with ryu and meteos still outperformed ur shitter tsm. And 800k vs rookie salary of eu (especially cheapskate fnc) is no joke of a determination to play in a good region.

hma3gah,ashok36,11/27/2021,1,372.0,Imagine if there were a couple of Playlist on Spotify that you cant control. The appeal seems to be that you can know youre listening to the exact same song at the exact same time as a bunch of other people.  Also the Playlists are slightly different depending on what town you live in but only very barely different.
hmafpuq,frumfram,11/27/2021,1,,Well in that case maybe one wrongdoing I can think of then is what was previously mentioned that management could have made better job to really made it stick to some of the players that it is legit situation to prevent those false claims  I think all people involved have right to be frustrated but for sure some of the things in twitlongers wouldve been better left unsaid
hmaffsj,Rodniconii,11/27/2021,1,66.0,Thats actually a good question but I dont believe so. I would have to check it again. If she did then it would make her heel turn make more sense. It wouldnt change my mind about SOL at all because of how horribly the characters were portrayed. Especially considering many of the characters that should have been in the story werent.

hma0jby,Roojercurryninja,11/27/2021,1,25.0,but then again doublelift wouldnt even have been able to keep it a secret even if he wanted to.  With that said DL is completely in the right here  if youre going to ditch your teammates right before worlds with clear to little time to process and adapt then you better be sure that they understand that its absolutely necessary for you to leave them  a certain level of privacy is possible but your teammates need to understand the severity without knowing exactly whats going on

hmae997,TuxSH,11/27/2021,1,13.0,You mean the haste you lose going from Kindlegem to completed item without 360 stacks.  The item is a joke the fact Fimbul manages to have about the same winrate as 80 AP Seraphs despite Kassadin having multiple 80% AP ratios and high mana costs is pretty telling.
hm9u9hm,ch4ppi,11/27/2021,1,288.0,Are you planing to sell your reddit account. The karma farming is quite strong.
hm9ecac,Lukrise,11/27/2021,1,161.0,That’s not how it works. Like not at all.
hm9b8oi,chutiyamod92,11/27/2021,1,158.0,I dont think thats true. Youre assuming you have an infinite number of games to play.  Say a P2 player will have 51%wr in P2 but 48%wr in D4  But say someone plays 500 ranked games in a year then he only has a net loss of 10 games which probably isnt enough to demote.

hmb1j4g,JackPoe,11/27/2021,1,530.0,I loved hearing ability sounds in the show.  My eyes are shit so I play this game largely through audio cues.  Was fun to hear them outside of the game.
hm9v1vs,Random_Stealth_Ward,11/27/2021,1,36.0,Not really just 50 range is worth a lot for a ton of ADCs. One of the common complains about champions like kalista or Wivir for example are their pathetic ranges 50 on them is huge nevermind 100. the problem is that in early game ranged Champions take too long to get to it and then use the extra range in part due to lower agency for many of them thanks to supports and junglers while melees usually are against melees and the most they worry about is the jungler so with the high AS scaling and more agency/control it becomes a very strong choice.  Range gets less AS obviously because they will get more AS than melees in general but it feels like atm melee AS is too high while ranged AS is too low
hmau69n,RiftHunter4,11/27/2021,1,7.0,At least she didnt post an image of herself. Reddit loses its crap over women.   GORL!? IZ GORL SINGLE?  RIP INBOX  Be my Sup for life babe  HAWT  BONK   This whole website is thirsty AF.

hmb39g1,BahLo-,11/27/2021,1,402.0,Because if its something series whats the harm in letting your teamates know? There is literally no harm in that then they would understand and support him.  Copy pasting what another user said agreeing with me listing what we know.  With what we know theres a lot of evidence to show it was probably because of his wifes feelings. which is BS.   &#x200B  I think it is pretty obvious from everything that Upsets wife was saying she was depressed. And then the day before worlds she probably called him crying or something and then he rushed him.        So he went home and to cheer her up he played some ARAM.        This fits with everything anyone has said on the issue and with the actions.        We know:        1 It was an issue going on for several weeks that got worse just before worlds (a sudden event)        2 It was to do with his wife - Yamato in the interview linked the two when talking about it he said how dedicated upset was for grinding after this marriage and how it was really tough for him at the time (why the fuck would you get married during the season rather than waiting till the offseasons I have no idea).        3 Upset wont say the reason because people will question if it is a legit reason and harass his wife.        4 Adam said his wife was feeling lonely which fits.        5 Fits with all the wife buff comments from bwipos gf that they later said was a coincidence (obviously it wasnt lol).
hmaj5h2,SP3EDI,11/27/2021,1,375.0,false rumors that are already debunked. pls stop spreading false shit. Upset was approached by alphari + fnatic not the other way around. If you get asked if you want the Adam or Alphari in your team especially if you played with both of them before i would choose alphari also. You would be stupid to chose adam above alphari.

I guess I just need a new realistic goal in life to pursue but I just don’t know anymore it all feels boring and league is all I know after all these years.

Hes still a world champion to diminish it with how recent it was is kind of ridiculous.   corejj cant win lcs with stacked af rosters for 2 years in a row It is a 5v5 team game right? That means it doesnt all fall on one person right? Im just asking because the way you phrase your response you seem to think its a 1v1 solo game and one person can carry.

hma3d30,tautckus1,11/27/2021,1,149.0,Bwipo refused a 800k offer in his rookie year from na. Multiple times he said he doesnt care for na. This worlds he got scapegoated to hell and back and finally gave in. If he had a normal.worlds you can bet he would be on fnc as the franchise player as he was meant to be. Adam was being built up for all summer and playoffs to be a key player whose playstyle was all about sacking lane and tping bot/mid. Nisqy was having the split of his life yet due to his playstyle being roam bot and havint a shit worlds is now out of a team. If fnatic had their roster they make atleast quarters and this squad 9/10  times stays the same. Even if they dont none of them would of got crucified by the community like they did during worlds. Only upset has 0 blame whilst he is the main reason for this teams implosion
hm99qk0,musashihokusai,11/27/2021,1,137.0,Gwen taught me damage calculations. She’s the first “dump all your shit and kill the dude” champ I’ve seriously learned and I’ve gotten much better at being mindful about how much damage I do and if I can kill/outrade.

hmaktic,NeekoBestTomato,11/27/2021,1,376.0,Yes quite right there is a difference there.  Which makes YOUR defence of why Upset didnt talk to Adam and everyone else invalid. Glad you understand.  > If I were mad and you were to send other people over to harass me  Nobody did that here so another strawman. Shit Upset made it worse for himself to be honest. If his attempts to communicate with the team are as bad as those twitlongers you cna see exactly why this went to shit cant you? That was a fantastic advertizement from Upset not to play with him if thats what he calls good communication.

hma0bx7,Sufficient_Focus,11/27/2021,1,30.0,Try to learn your champion in bots first and watch a few guides. Its co-op vs ai so you wont feel left out or anything. You dont have to but youll probably have a better time.
hmac1bs,Banzai9171,11/27/2021,1,311.0,I had my one of my parents in hospice care. You dont spend every waking moment with them. Sometimes they prefer to be alone or you let them talk to another family member/friend by themselves.  Also we dont even know if thats the situation. Doing something like playing a video game can help take someones mind off of a bad situation. The whole but he played Arams!!! take is so dumb and it comes from a very immature and inexperienced perspective.

hma4trx,supapumped,11/27/2021,1,60.0,I have not ran into any Udyr recently as WW but Tiger stance Udyr used to be able to absolutely destroy WW at almost any point of the game in a 1v1.   With the new Lethal tempo and stronger tank items in preseason I am not sure if that is still the case though.
hmbk7ta,NotAStatistic2,11/27/2021,1,154.0,Dont get me started on the Swain rework. My boy used to strike fear into the hearts of top lane tanks and junglers attempting ganks. Now people only play him bot lane because he gets destroyed by every champ in solo lanes :(

hmbicvi,Sonder332,11/27/2021,1,19.0,Okay so I guess since Ahri is coded for Korean server rep and someone in the comments said Sera is coded for Chinese server rep hence why she got the phoenix skin. Does NA or EU have one?
hm9vqhz,nyasiaa,11/27/2021,1,69.0,they should hire people making custom map skins if they dont wanna do it themselves people have done so many cool map skins that could bring riot a lot of money if they got official support  people are still updating old summoners rift maps winter maps etc. from patch to patch (and riot is doing *everything* in their power to kill custom skins so thats really impressive) give that official support sell it in shop for RP and it would be great  if an old summoners rift map was available in the shop I would buy it insantly not even thinking about anything I just like it so much more

hmbovto,DHSUAUGEV,11/27/2021,1,326.0,Thats because yasuo actually doesnt abuse lethal tempo. Yone does. But you literally just ignored everything he said because if yasuos winrate. He went into full detail about how they abuse adc items better than any adc could ever could. Its not as much a rant of yasuo and yone need to be nerfed I suck. But more of a yasuo and yone need to be changed so adcs can co exist with them.
hm9d6u2,TH3RM4L33,11/27/2021,1,215.0,Thats alright too. Thank you for clarifying!
hmbgbbc,Cahecher,11/27/2021,1,,Thats exactly my point 369 cannot be left alone because hell find a way to die. Id say hes similar with JL though JL is not as bad with his ints. In the case of 369 it seems to my bronzie redditors eyes that he forgets enemy team exists while JL just tries to outplay every fight (be it 2v2 or 2v5) so having both of them on a team at the same time is somewhat problematic. Imo thats part of the reason Karsa looked completely lost since every decision he made was a mistake because of these two. A similar thing happened with JL and TheShy in iG - they became dysfunctional at some point.  Hence I am really happy 369 and JL arent going to play on the same team and I am specifically excited about the idea of Zoom playing in TES. Zoom can be a threat on his own allowing JL to shine (at least on paper it can be this way).   Also while its important that 369 is criticized its not like this guy has no talent - mechanically hes insane on his carry champions but he lacks awareness.
hmawu9m,stuffslols,11/27/2021,1,27.0,Piecd by piece. And lots of practice. First I reccomened looking up an item build guide online and following that every game but making sure you read the item and its stats/passive so you can see what it does and how to work with it. Once your comfortable  then your try looking through the store for an item. You think would be good and try it out see how it feels and works for ya. Wash rinse repeat.  Thankfully it gets easier over time. For most items you just need to know the passive and general role (ex: sunfire aegis is a tank item that hurts when you stand near them) so you know how the enemy will play and can work around their surprises.  Honestly Champs are much more difficult to learn than items if your practicing imo

hmb5xtp,roadnot_taken,11/27/2021,1,264.0,Winrate doesnt tell the whole story. You have to correlate pick rate and ban rate as well. If a champion has like a 16% pick rate 52% is massive.
hm91a9l,bananazee,11/27/2021,1,220.0,Yeah I noticed it wasn’t really reported in western media but basically he was going around conning multiple single girls out of money pretending he was single and into them even tho he was dating someone who worked for the EDG org. It’s not so bad that it’s misconduct but it’s definitely shitty. Happened over a year ago and I think is partly why EDG was willing to sign Viper instead of developing Hope more. (If you know Chinese you can just Google “EDG hope 出轨” to read the background.)
hmbb44c,Hatmosthe1st,11/27/2021,1,264.0,Lethal Tempo appeared to be the least selected rune although its win rate was noticeably similar to the other two (PTA and fleet footwork). So that meant that this rune was niche or less satisfying (or both). Bruh and A Sol ?

It didnt get buffed single time. Tbh one specific build was intended for Fiora but was built on Camille... But it wasnt buffed in meanwhile and they used to run almost same items. Even now they kinda do this whole mythic items thing kinda makes them build diff items.  >HoB is horrendous on rengar. Youre not an auto attack based carry youre a spell based assassin. If your target is alive long enough for you auto more than twice youre behind. Take electrocute  I am spell AA based assassin. Rengar builds crit. And guess what? AAing enemies with crit items hurts them.  >If your target is alive long enough for you auto more than twice youre behind. Take electrocute.  What an horrendous argument falacy right there. We arent playing bloodmoon mode. There are targets that wont get oneshotted on two autos and there is higher chance that target gonna get overkilled on two AAs and the same applies that he wouldnt die to small electro damage if he doesnt die in two AAs.  Also I can say: I am not behind I am just killing multiple targets which is also a thing where HoB is way better than electro.  Pull ur head out of ur ass.
hmaffv9,SP3EDI,11/27/2021,1,,Dude then its Adams own stupidity when he still doesnt know what happend. There was even a fucking press release about what he needed to know.

hm925pq,WintersEnvoy,11/27/2021,1,183.0,When you play as much as 8 games a day for 95 % of people that time is mostly autopilot the trick is ofc making sure youre actually good at autopiloting which requires you to be focused and try your hardest for long periods of time  (e.g same way studying and work is mostly automated IRL its just how our brains work but if you do that and ONLY that nothings ever going to change just static no improvement)  Even for a pro youre autopiloting certain parts of the game so your brain doesnt collapse from stress or madness like csing is something that should eventually become effortless (for the most part and some unique adjustments will be made a few times every game) but if its effortlessly bad and you never seek to improve it your gameplay suffers heavily from it.  &#x200B  That said theres always that argument the playerbase is always getting better you only raise your rank relatively with skill improvement when you improve your skill faster than other people in your old rank. At least to a large extent gold players now can be really decent at understanding how to lane plats most definitely (some not all) but tend to collapse in how to play after 15 minutes. Theres not the sligthest doubt that bronze players s5 were utter garbage compared to bronze players s11 so theres probably been some improvement just not enough compared to most other people lol

hm9dzxm,Hecate27,11/27/2021,1,67.0,So Im not saying theyre right but...  You being bad does directly decrease the amount of fun they have. So even though its reasonable for you to be first-timing a champ in norms it still screws over your teammates who want to have an even game.
hm9q2f4,CCrimson93X,11/27/2021,1,8.0,Well I did say in my experience not yours.  1. Im not though Annies Q is a skill shot in wildrift and she is doing just fine there. Im not asking any champion to be deleted. Im asking for skill shots on everyone to make it more balanced. I really cannot see your point here. 2. Bot leveled accounts? Thats still a thing? Ive never fought a bot in the main summoners rift map ever. Are they common or something? Id like to hear more on this. But the point is it would increase skill level even overall which means both sides will make less stupid plays = less frustration within the games and hopefully a less toxic community too.  3. I feel as if it would be worth to implement into the game. Help with learning to freeze lanes jungle routes etc.  4. Well I never said the system would be perfect but at the same time from where Im standing it would help in the longer run not to mention a fair majority of players already have level 4 on 20+ champs anyways so. Normals are used for casual games and practice outside of ranked so I generally fail to see where the terrible idea comes from. 5. True but at the same time it would also help players see a in game skin compared to said splash art. Dota 2 Smite etc. have all got their skins & cosmetics on show for the person to see League could do that instead if needed.   6. Honestly I dont see it as useless as its only a small tip and its optional

hma5v4v,frumfram,11/27/2021,1,147.0,I honestly think people who just dont think it through think this way  I brought this tragedy up vaguely earlier in defense of Upsets decision keep it private (goes without saying but hopefully Upsets close ones dont have similar or comparable situation)  Think it this way:  You have a number of friends and family you are essentially okay any and every one of your friends and family sharing any private matter in your life to people who are strangers to you because your friends or family work closely with these other people you know nothing about but you are okay them sharing your private matters to these people who are strangers to you because they have this team bond(?)  I get that pro players barely have any privacy anyway living in gaming houses and whatnot but this isnt matter of their own privacy but their close ones who probably dont know much about these teammates or what kind of people they are and they should be okay with these strangers knowing anything about them  I dont buy it I legit think some people just arent thinking this through

hmb9uin,voidxleech,11/27/2021,1,549.0,fair enough. i dunno what it is particularly about the lip syncing videos like this that irks me. i think i see it as wasted potential you know? it’s a wonderful cosplay that was likely a huge labor of love juxtaposed against what i think is the laziest form of modern content. at the end of the day though my opinion doesn’t really matter and to each their own.
hmb8815,2Teemos1Cup69,11/27/2021,1,196.0,> When has riot cared about the fan base  Literally always?
hm9yg46,mi-0-0,11/27/2021,1,188.0,Well. I think there is thing called a level of familiarity. Its not like Upset was asked to disclose this stuff with some Fnatics janitor like do you really think that this fine to say to the colleagues same thing as the public...
hm9a8kd,Xaneth_,11/27/2021,1,18.0,I knew she looked familiar just checked and yeah looks like u/Littlejem the one who made this [insane FFXIV Dead Hive Claymore replica](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/keh3ie/just_finished_my_dead_hive_claymore_replica_for/). She doesnt pull any punches.

hmbnhl4,TuxSH,11/27/2021,1,35.0,>  her plants can and will push the wave  Which is exactly what some ADCs want. For example Caitlyn. I often see Cait paired with Zyra or Brand so I just kill two birds with one stone and ban her.  > and none of her abilities are defensive abilities  Any CC ability especially reliable ones like hers can be used defensively. Of course any decent enemy will engage onto you if you waste your E and miss it.  >  so you really can’t peel for your adc  Her E plants slow and Glacial Augment Zyra is a thing in some matchups this patch.
hmaigsb,Repulsive_Cry9980,11/27/2021,1,19.0,And adcs don’t have broken champions. On all other roles always some champs are the way better than others. For example Camille Kassadin Nocturne Nautilus. With broken champs is easy to climb. But broken adc… Vayne? maybe?..Only with enchanter sup…
hmaming,chariotofidiots,11/27/2021,1,143.0,Lmaoo I kept Q-ing into bushes with control wards today thinking there was an enemy in there and being like oh its the CWard silly me i forgot it does that and completely forgot that its not supposed to show the ! mark.  Her stealth range was also sometimes missing and i wondered why that is guess I know now (does this also happen with chemtech? I remember being unable to see the camo range while in the fog at some point)

hm9cw6n,WintersEnvoy,11/27/2021,1,27.0,I think minecraft went a good direction its just an example microsoft has more impact on minecraft than tencent does on league just objectively. Tencent only got involved for controlling the chinese LoL market and has some say in how the international tournaments are handled other than that its just an investment (which probably paid well) its just reddit drama to blame china for genuinely random things as long as theres the slightest connection

hmaepau,toxicityisamyth,11/27/2021,1,26.0,Wow i cant imagine an eu or na coach yelling at western teams like that. The players would just go and cry about how he has no respect for them theyre not children etc etc.  I respect cn/kr coaches a lot they pull no punches and i respect the players some of them are paid millions and they still listen and go back on the rift with a reignited resolve.  Cool episode.
hmb2628,Xgunter,11/27/2021,1,,And people on this sub advocate for him to be nerfed when he sits at his usual 52-53% winrate because they see that number and assume nerfs = good.

hm95u0f,V1pArzZ,11/27/2021,1,38.0,Ah yeah he does. Yeah nevermind. I thought u meant warden wich he is classified right now. The support tanks like Taric and Braum and now he has basically nothing supportive about him. Ornn and sion are pretty similar to him as high damage tanks so id say he fits there.

hma9gwh,SnooPeripherals6388,11/27/2021,1,311.0,Nah i dont think so. Adam doesnt know even the type of the reason why he left(is this health problem or something with material part at least how hard the problem is) so he just feels kinda betrayed. The last drop of his patience was Upsets words about his Worlds performance
hma1941,mi-0-0,11/27/2021,1,25.0,Lets not exaggerate. Adam is in a great spot with new team and new coaching stuff. Plus it was an amazing half a year. Bwipo wouldnt find a TL level team in EU plus TL is great team with great perspectives (worlds at least). Only Nisqy is in the gutter.

hma351j,ilikewater0202,11/27/2021,1,280.0,Yes
hm8xjym,BBQMasterDad,11/27/2021,1,2.0,I honestly think they’re pointless in the sense of… why the fuck does Riot keep trying to keep games from being snowballs? If a team is down bad enough to the point where they need some sort of “freebie pick me up” they shouldn’t deserve that bounty in the first place all it does is incentivize the winning team from defending pointless objectives at the cost of the enemy team getting a decent sum of gold for… literally playing the game? It’s the same reason why I believe shut down bounties are absurd.
hm9ryly,tanezuki,11/27/2021,1,60.0,Im not implying theyre not fighters Im just specifically talking about one of their subclass. My first sentence is misleading and worded in a too simplistic way.
hm9xz3r,yp261,11/27/2021,1,,thia dude really thinks some casual players who dont even know the term „smurf” are smurfing buahaha i cant
hmapbt3,mivaad,11/27/2021,1,20.0,a true toplaner
hmbdhst,GDSBCM,11/27/2021,1,,They should have made new accounts. I believe the system just throws you into a smurf queue or just matches you into more experienced players if you queue with your friends pre-existing accounts. Everytime Ive tried to get a new friend into the game I create a new account to teach them the game properly. If similar to my experience your account is a bit scuffed now until you get placed in Ranked.  Basically system expects your friends to carry your games meanwhile you get to eat dirt.
hmbbyim,ilovefishs911,11/27/2021,1,263.0,No you don’t have to consider ban rates. Ban rates is largely how annoying the champion is to play against
hmabvsn,RandomFactUser,11/27/2021,1,49.0,Taliyah is supposed to gain a MS boost near walls when out of combat
hmbfo8i,KosViik,11/27/2021,1,303.0,> but getting 100 range is so massive.  The thing is you need 6 autos to get that range increase.  If you did 6 autos to someone and the range really starts to matter then something is off.  You either wouldve attack moved him down anyway -> range doesnt really matter. Or by the time you get 6 autos off your Assassin/Mage/Tank will one-shot whoever it is anyway (the teamfight will likely be long decided by then). Or by the time you get 6 autos off the enemy Assassin/Mage/Tank will fart on you and one shot you.  Honestly the only stable use for it is annoying people in lane with Caitlyn as such early on people arent repeatedly one-shot so she has time to get the stacks...
hm9n7io,Fast_Instruction_286,11/27/2021,1,21.0,Big facts! Roast this mong.  Imagine being proud of not ffing an 0-30 game should be bannable.
hmamyno,Semikatyri,11/27/2021,1,129.0,I feel like they really should have given us arcane themed maps piltover vs zaun for SR and the piltover bridge for aram
hm9mlko,A_Very_Horny_Zed,11/27/2021,1,39.0,Not necessarily. Inputting the same keyword (or keywords) with the same template will always bring a unique result.
hm999qp,qacaysdfeg,11/27/2021,1,346.0,easiest way to get them riled up is mistaking their language for example tell the portuguese you dont speak taco
hm9gvmi,-LostInCloud-,11/27/2021,1,389.0,Smurfqueue is not better in that sense. Its still matchmaking its just... Very toxic.  I didnt play ranked at all really for like 2 years so when I played a bit this year I was placed into Bronze II. (Am Platinum player)  Because I was obviously way ahead I was then ... Still matched with silvers and such ... But everyone else was a smurf.  I had games where the max level of the 9 others was like 32.  While I was stomping the games it was so incredibly toxic Id rather not play. And people going afk or griefing is just a coinflip thats hard to overcome. I did not feel I wanted to play a sufficient amount of games to climb out of smurfqueue.   I just went and played Flex when alone DuoQ was the only way to escape smurfqueue.
hmbi2tk,Cryp6,11/27/2021,1,214.0,At this point I cant tell if youre trolling or just in too deep trying to defend your point.
hm95tyw,Terozu,11/27/2021,1,98.0,They werent a thing yet but they were definitely building a thing.
hm9jogv,Houson2k,11/27/2021,1,127.0,Or when bwipo publicly stated he doesnt want to play with selfmade and nemesis? Or how Caps and jankos apparently said they dont agree with rekkles way of playing the game? Or current FNC situation how they just went boom?  Yeah its surely caps backstabbing fnc everything else that happened in the last 3 years is a coincidence.
hmahjip,lockZmith,11/27/2021,1,21.0,The names for the blue and pink one are switched in the shop you can see in the bundle that the blue one says pink and vice versa. Somethings probably fucked up there i wanted to get those two chromas but i couldnt find them either
hm9fxid,DanteStorme,11/27/2021,1,47.0,Yone Yasuo and Viego all have some part of their kit interact with getting crit thats why they build crit items. The same goes for some juggernauts who can get the full benefit of a tank item in thornmail.  It doesnt mean every juggernaut should build every tank item.
hmafc8f,ZeysarSama,11/27/2021,1,19.0,Like literally anything else. Hitting your toe on your wardrobe is more enjoyable.
hmaa5rz,xInnocent,11/27/2021,1,408.0,Almost expected when we got Arcane as late in 2021 as we did.  Normally animated shows take around a year between releases and they have way lower production quality than Arcane.
hma7j11,Ringo_A,11/27/2021,1,145.0,Literally everybody that actually knows actually said they cant say what it was but it was actually that bad and they agree with his decision. Even people that usually hate on FNC like Rich agreed that they did everything right here. No idea if youre 15 or something but everybody has their own ways to cope with pain and stress and sometimes even if somebody was in hospital for example he cant be there 24/7. So saying his pain cant be bad because he relaxes with a few arams with his wife just shows that you have no idea what life can throw at you sometimes.
hm979x6,BarkFrungusPhD,11/27/2021,1,6.0,I got it in a box just the other day actually. Like others have said though wait for the next skin in the line to come out and you should be able to get it again. If for whatever reason you cant or wanna spend a stupid amount of money to get it now boxes are your best bet or waiting for Your Shop

hm8zllh,ImTheNguyenerOne,11/27/2021,1,145.0,Yeah passing on 4 years 70 mil to sign a 4.1 mil qualifying offer then a 2 year minimum at just under 2 mil a year isnt a good look. It just kinda feeds into the idea of not being too greedy Rich Paul told him he was a 100 million man and he ended up making like a third of that contract with the 27 million he just signed for with the Knicks

hma96va,NeitherAlexNorAlice,11/27/2021,1,,Yeah privacy should be respected but not at the cost of the biggest tournament you have been waiting years to get into. That is when Upset should have been transparent with his teammates. They all deserved clarity instead of being thrown in the dark 11 hours before their first game.

hm90lwz,dannyboyheinz,11/27/2021,1,13.0,Theyre dying because they suck. Sure I can TP bot and help them but if I dont get a kill (trying to gank a lane with 2 fed champs isnt exactly free) I will lose my entire advantage topside. TPing bot means my lane opponent will take tower plates and catch up in CS. Or they take Rift and snowball. TPing bot prior to 14 minutes as a champ other than Shen has been extremely risky for a while now.

hmbrek7,Farler,11/27/2021,1,70.0,Im a pyke main. My personal opinion is its just a snowbally item only worth getting on mid pyke. Heres the thing. You have 6 item slots. 4 of those are gonna be supp item boots mythic (usually duskblade) and Umbral glaive (absolutely OP broken for a support). Youre left with two more slots one of which is gonna be youmuus (great lethality and good for both in and out of combat movespeed). Usually your last item is something defensive like maw edge of night deaths dance or GA. Axiom just doesnt fit in and by that point in the game pyke ult is on a really low CD anyways.  Mid pyke its totally worth as a second item though because you have at least one slot freed up from supp item and maybe even a 2nd freed up because Umbral isnt mandatory just good if you want to help your support with vision control (which you should).
hm9v8p1,The-Devils-Advocator,11/27/2021,1,288.0,This is a really good cosplay its great realistic and very well made.   But why title it like that? Ive seen many great and realistic Jinx cosplays over the years shes a popular character to cosplay and I feel like a remember some more realistic than this. But I dont wanna be bringing anyone down point out flaws or talk shit in any way especially because theres a chance the cosplayer herself reads this. Why not just call it an amazing cosplay why you gotta set yourself or her rather up for dispute like this?  Im probably over thinking it.  Wait... is realistic even an appropriate term for cosplaying an *animated* character? Maybe accurate?

hmb34jq,Garborge,11/27/2021,1,208.0,Seconding doomed.   Not because he can’t learn or something like that but because after thousands of ranked games in bronze he clearly has a *view* of what the game is.   You don’t play that many games per season unless you’re addicted or really enjoy the game and there’s a chance OP’s friend wouldn’t even enjoy playing higher Elo matches. In the low depths of bronze league is a team deathmatch game. That can be pretty cool if you’re into it.

hmagg4q,rjaydo2,11/27/2021,1,35.0,Sorry but I can quite honestly play the game in any fashion I choose. I play to gain LP for the competitive aspect. I dont find the game fun to play at a low elo in solo queue plain and simple.   It is a problem in lower elos yes but your post does not differentiate the break-point like I had described. Im stating that your opinion does not hold water after a certain elo bracket. The people not surrendering in the situations Im referring to are the ones griefing not the 4 others agreeing the game is over. Typically a 4-0 no vote comes with Ill just waste your guys time comment directly after.  Im going to stop here though since I have made multiple points throughout my posts of which you glossed over not addressed then inserted how your opinion of the game is correct over mine. Good luck on the rift my friend.

hmbheie,bsr9090,11/27/2021,1,561.0,Nah man this is cringe af. All the upvotes are from horny incels.
hmbj415,ApplePitou,11/27/2021,1,1.0,My second favorite scene :3
hma8opj,bobinncl,11/27/2021,1,314.0,Upset thinks he already share enough. (Understandable)  Adam/Bwipo didnt think Upset share anything them losing turned their frustration into rage then exploded. (Understandable)  What made such thing happens? Fnatic management aka Yamato who knows the truth yet did nothing (or did not do enough) to ease Adam/Bwipo.
hm9bndo,Raynar7,11/27/2021,1,12.0,It’s a game it’s the internet don’t take it personally grow up. Cloak of anonymity does wonder to what people type.   And if you think something like toxicity (aka people being assholes rude racist etc) can be abolished. Oh boy do I have bad news for ya.
hm9llj9,mattiejj,11/27/2021,1,130.0,Also the Imagine Dragons song is drivel.
hm9ljo4,xKyubi,11/27/2021,1,130.0,the average tiktokers dance around like monkeys / share themselves doing crimes lip syncing is ironically the most normal thing they do in that site.
hm9kpy8,Klaymoor11,11/27/2021,1,87.0,Sudden Impact isnt proccing even if she uses an auto-attack. It isnt working on Twitch or Qiyana either (I dont own other invisible/stealth champs ATM so I cant run more tests). Seems to be a larger problem than just Eve.
hmb85w7,Distinger_,11/27/2021,1,125.0,The chemtech shoul should be reworked completely it’s just absurdly broken and unfair on many levels.  It does not make any fucking sense that every fight becomes a 5v10. The enemies could even let one person perma split and they would still be fighting as 5v8 taking towers for free while also winning teamfights or taking objectives.  It is already obnoxious when one fed person in the enemy team builds GA now imagine if every person has a free revive with no cooldown that’s what this bullshit soul is. And now imagine if on top of having chemtech soul they also build GA or have champions that revive like Sion Karthus Zilean etc. You end up with a fucking mess of a game.  Not only it is an almost certain won game for the team that got the soul but it’s also a very toxic mechanic that should not exist. (Yes this includes Akshan’s revive. It should be reworked into giving the extra gold from it’s passive to the avenged allies).  Either completely rework the soul or at least give more debuffs to the revived like not being able to apply omnivamp/lifesteal or use summoners/items and ffs give it a cooldown of at least 3 minutes.
hma46dg,UltraScept,11/27/2021,1,149.0,Upset: leaves team 12 hours before worlds refuses to tell almost everyone on the team any reason why plays Aram with his wife while his teammates suffer humiliating and demoralizing losses on stage in front of millions of people while watching thousands of hours of dedicated practice go down the drain  Adam: voices his frustrations thoughts and experiences in an online post  A large part of the community: fucking Adam what a scumfuck bastard. What an untrustworthy cruel and malicious human being
hmbgy2w,OneBar1905,11/27/2021,1,28.0,That last point is pretty naive. Evil people are people who do evil things regardless of intention. Hitler was trying to create a utopia for Germans. The problem is that utopia requires the extermination of Jewish people. Singed is just trying to advance science. The problem is that he is responsible for the deaths of countless innocent people.
hmb9pa7,Rodniconii,11/27/2021,1,83.0,Sol shouldve answered that but it was a rushed trash event that was plagued with plot holes.
hmbk3m2,thimo50,11/27/2021,1,303.0,>Vayne is benefiting from the objective bounty system thats why her winrate is increasing. She gets a lot of free gold from objective bounties that helps her survive mid-game.   Any stats on that? I just looked through every single bot match-up for vayne and no champ has a higher first tower time than her in any match-up. Its pretty hard to believe she consistently gets the first tower only has a slightly lower first kill ratio yet benefits that much from bounties so she benefits a lot from bounties while consistently getting the bot tower first?   I know bounties also depend on farm and kills and so on but there is no way LT doesnt play a big role in her WR spike. Just look at the different WR based on runes. LT has a way higher WR than PTA.
hmbepmm,OneDrunkDonut,11/27/2021,1,364.0,Hi! Which role did you find the easiest to climb with especially in lower elo? thx.
hmaa1se,Umarill,11/27/2021,1,311.0,I said it on Upsets last post got downvoted for it.  This subreddit is purely moronic whoever speaks last changes the main narrative and others opinions are silenced through downvotes. Got piled on by people who told me I was wrong and that I was just defending Adam because he is French and that the French community is a cesspool that harasses Upset.   The downvote system is dreadful in those situations. Fuck everyone that abuses it to be able to shout louder than what they dont want to hear.
hm96y6z,Divine_Platypus,11/27/2021,1,11.0,I mean... Its the exact same a ability just with a throwing effect if the target dies
hmb57xh,napkim,11/27/2021,1,12.0,Your best bet is probably making a new account for practicing a bit or just playing bot games
hma9gfd,Coolestdude123,11/27/2021,1,311.0,The latest PR post from Upset (almost certainly written by Fnatic) was successful in gas lighting the whole thing. Companies like Fnatic are pretty good at manipulating PR opinion.
hmake8n,ItsKipz,11/27/2021,1,58.0,/mute all is your friend some people just suck but you do not have to listen to them at all  like legit if you just mute everybody and play your game alone youll have such a great time game should come standard with all players muted LMAO
hmaahnw,Taivasvaeltaja,11/27/2021,1,192.0,It is pretty clear they wanted Larssen (and perhaps Odo) replaced. Basically either create a super team or we are done.
hma1ues,bronet,11/27/2021,1,327.0,I think its a good comparison a lot of younger people today are probably more familiar with the music of Imagine Dragons than that of Beatles.  Both are popular bands
hma5ryk,bearugh,11/27/2021,1,6.0,Tank kog seems to do damage just fine with building hardly any ad items ap kog does more damage at two items than some mages idk what your on my guy
hm9qop7,Rodniconii,11/27/2021,1,43.0,Yeah I saw the ending scene. I still think it doesnt work.   She already had that conflict with Viego plus Illaoi doesnt even show up to help. It seems so forced.
hmbhibx,ApplePitou,11/27/2021,1,5.0,Shaco didnt get any nerfs as far as I know because I really like playing him and I often check if he got any weaken or not :3  Additionally I dont know what is causing your results to deteriorate because Shaco hasnt changed :3
hm9pxa8,OnFallenWings,11/27/2021,1,26.0,Yeah mate I dont get to play this game more than a couple of hours. I really think your mentality applies to people who have loads of spare time and arent doing long shifts 6 days a week.  Pretending this is about always winning is just bullshit. If you had limited time to play too you wouldnt want to be stuck in a game with somebody flaming and wasting your time. Sometimes that 10 minutes is the difference between getting another game in and not being able too. Sure you lose .1% winrate if you ff early but you get to play more games which means you actually have a chance to climb. Its actually optimal with limited time so dont give me this winners mentality shite.
hma151h,EuHypaH,11/27/2021,1,431.0,Guess I’m too used to people ‘arguing’ in the LoL context rather than offering a counterpoint which was your intend. x.x
hmb2h6n,lun533,11/27/2021,1,540.0,Judging his ability to head coach from twitch streams is kind of weird.  Just because the stake is so low in those discussions with viewers. Theres no point in arguing with LS when hes raging unless you are having fun with it. The lack of action at times doesnt mean he has problems with taking it. And he does offer counter points against LS. See what he said when LS talked about how its not worth it to make edu content.     On the other hand you can see he shows the ability in communicating his own points and getting the callers points when they arent elaborated well. So youd think hes capable of getting his points across to his players better than someone like LS  AND you have teams where people are only assertive but fail to get on the same page.
hmb3ysk,DankerinoHD,11/27/2021,1,147.0,I’m not arguing about how fluent they are I’m simply pointing out that had Nuguri even tried to learn the language he would at least be able to perform basic conversations.

hmbfeoq,firewall245,11/27/2021,1,42.0,Where are the vods?
hmb0ofq,MarioToast,11/27/2021,1,13.0,The comic Blood of Noxus is the only place I know of that shows Darius reacting to the attack. Long story short he was pretty silent and stoic about it so hard to gauge much of an opinion from it. My guess is that he thinks of it as cruel but ultimately necessary to Noxus survival (which Id say is his mental defense mechanism to a lot of the brutality Noxus engages in)
hm9g8nv,PeopleAreHellaStupid,11/27/2021,1,247.0,I did it in gold you dont hear me bragging
hmb72as,roadnot_taken,11/27/2021,1,264.0,Anyone thinking ADC isnt the strongest role right now next to a few tanks like Warwic Trundle and Mundo is nuts. Pretty much anything that can stack 4k HP and deal high damage. ADC is super reliable better itemization than ever and has so many life saving mechanics its crazy.
hmbgs1h,wal2349,11/27/2021,1,,you are looking at it from the wrong perspective. 4% is a lot when its a drop from 13% to 9%.
hmbjht7,Trane155,11/27/2021,1,633.0,I just started playing last week and Im wondering after getting my six items is there anything to do with the gold I have?  Cause some games that are long or Im getting a ton of kills I can end up with like 2-5k gold after getting six items
hmbe4pc,DizzyRonin,11/27/2021,1,,I laughed at that c:

hmbbhlg,Ragingroseman,11/27/2021,1,160.0,Yes two of the most frustrating bugs are your W not instantly giving you a ghosted effect and the fact that if a minion slightly bumps you your axes go half a screen away 🤷‍♂️. Not to mention other bugs with his ult being inconsistent in when it returns.
hmaypoa,Qwwerweii,11/27/2021,1,112.0,Since you choose to take 18 million to this team then please pay extra effort. No excuses at the very least you need to learn some simple phrases instead of having your teammates distracted during the game to translate for you
hmajpyk,WintersEnvoy,11/27/2021,1,8.0,Theres more supports than lux who does that the counterplay is her going oom and the fact that the poke isnt that dangerous on its own just embrace longsword + 3 pots meta.
hmaxabo,Labseuto,11/27/2021,1,28.0,Oh thats cool. Thanks for the reply.
hmbh1im,Head_Haunter,11/27/2021,1,303.0,Vayne is benefiting from the objective bounty system thats why her winrate is increasing. She gets a lot of free gold from objective bounties that helps her survive mid-game.   Caitlyn winrate actually went down with the new patch but that might also be because Riot accidentally removed like her only advanced combo - her headshot auto-cancel.  Riot already addressed this and are planning to fix (or already fixed Im not sure).
hmb3p2s,Althalus-,11/27/2021,1,165.0,During the event all the event chroma’s and stuff were supposed to come back and they didn’t. I’m not even sure it was a proper snow day event tbh…
hmakghn,FranticDisembowel,11/27/2021,1,38.0,That said I asked the U.GG team if they were planning to add timers to their app because I vastly prefer it to the Blitz app in every way except the lack of timers. They got back to me and said they were in talks with Riot because it was unclear whether or not jungle timers break the ToS and it seemed like Riot might address it very soon.  So I think Blitz might be taking a shoot first ask questions later approach. Or it was allowed when they added the feature but Riot might be backtracking.  Or maybe U.GG is just being overly cautious and they will add it later once Riot gives the go-ahead.
hm9ynrt,Pazbang,11/27/2021,1,4460.0,Have you ever played a team sport? Because if you had you clearly know that a team is much much more then “co-workers”
hmb7mkh,chineseduckman,11/27/2021,1,411.0,Are you fucking kidding me they had RYU and meteos among other mediocre players. Of course he didnt want to join that shitter roster. The fact that they got 2nd that split says more about how shit NA was that split than anything else
hmbhb6g,LumiRhino,11/27/2021,1,111.0,Even from the first game that they won you could tell their mentality. Spica was just like pick me Olaf even though hes shit.
hm9xtqk,fojek17,11/27/2021,1,,Unless you make money off of it every game win or lose is a waste of time in grand scheme of things. If you dont want to waste time then why are you putting it into something that will bring you nothing but short term pleasure?
hm8xiyn,jfads89a,11/27/2021,1,64.0,I suppose we will know in at most 3 more days. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
hma7dac,CanIBeFIREIn10Years,11/27/2021,1,4.0,Tbh I dont have much to tell you as you have done everything you could already. All I would suggest is to find a duo or a team in our LoL discord as there are plenty of people or teams that are looking for someone like you. Good luck and have fun! Cheers!  P/S: What I usually do during a losing streak like this is to take a break for a while and play norms/draft/aram to find some fun from the game instead of getting even more tilted and getting random toxic or troll players. I do it until I feel ready for rank again. This is just my own experience and opinion. I hope it could help.
hm8uxq5,ZackOBrien,11/27/2021,1,20.0,Download Blitz.gg it will auto import both builds and runes for you so thats less on your plate (though you have to make sure the options are checked on in the settings). However I recommend you to at least try and get familiar with the items and runes as you play.

hm9ojsg,Sktwin2k15,11/27/2021,1,11.0,I mostly spend that little time with friends yes but we have kinda split. I like tft some of em play aram (which is what we mostly play when we all play together) some play Ranked solo/duo and other play csgo. So we talk a lot in dc but hardly ever play together. But Im happy they still are at dc. Clash has been a travel back in time when we all played SR.

The fact that his employer side with him in this situation said a lot tbh. His teammates have the right to upset but they should confront it with him one on one rather than post it online.

hmbhc6k,Mamacrowhelps,11/27/2021,1,12410.0,Ive always seen this time and time again after these sorts of things. Arcane had some serious talent in it and its a work of art on its own. Just because its new doesnt need mean you have target what someones seen because its a new absolute favorite of theirs. For one Arcane sits easily at my top ten best animated series. Im not sure where but they dont really all compete in my mind anyways.

hmb6f2r,ArchdevilTeemo,11/27/2021,1,38.0,LoL is one of the most played online games because you can play it all the time and it never gets old because there is no story finale or max level.   Just like fortnite & minecraft - other very popular games.  LoL is also so popular because its a game everybody can play. Its F2P and even runs on shitty notebooks.   The best story game will never be more popular than big f2p mmos. Its just not possible.
hmaahmw,frumfram,11/27/2021,1,313.0,Yeah lots of people seem to agree that communicating wasnt good in this matter  It is weird though there was Yamatocannon interview on FNC worlds video that seemed sincere about the severity of it all perhaps that wasnt communicated internally to all the players properly
hmapz9q,Althalus-,11/27/2021,1,129.0,Yeah I wanted my snow day Chroma for Bard but they never released the winter shop stuff either
hm9xjun,Metaxpro,11/27/2021,1,275.0,But why should it require 3000 games to reach a rank youre already skilled enough to play at anyway? If you can climb in diamond you dont need to prove you can also climb up from silver.
hmb0y31,MoonDawg2,11/27/2021,1,,I have its usually not much of an issue because galeforce falls off so hard. Galeforce is there to just burst squishies if you dont fall on that category you shouldnt have an issue. Just ignore them and eat their frontline like juggernauts are meant to do.  Btw your champ has a bug that doubles its E range after flash if done correctly. Sett is the one that struggles the least against galeforce
hma7tid,falkner97,11/27/2021,1,145.0,like idgaf about the situation  upset can choose whether to tell the public or the fans thats his privacy to do so  but if he can choose to tell hyli and choose not to tell the rest of the team  something is wrong somewhere  in a normal setting nobody would give a fk whether he leaves his team or what  but during worlds where every single fan and even some of the public are looking at the competition  this is very shitty to do to his teammates  now FNC and the players get made into a laughing joke and i bet that this would affect them not just from their mental even their pay and buyouts would be affected considering their performance at worlds this year  and again this is not something yamato can decide for his team nor should anyone be able to tell the teammates that hey you should just accept this shitty situation

hmadav0,SP3EDI,11/27/2021,1,310.0,dunno where you are from but here in germany this exact right is written into the law. LEC + the teams are based in germany where it is in the law. Dunno in where you live or work but its more then enough to tell the coworkers that i have serious fam issue. no need to tell more about it. just have to inform your boss and thats all.
hm9d8jp,BagelJ,11/27/2021,1,14.0,Yeah it should absolutely break tos (as in if it doesnt ToS should be changed).   Imagine how different the game would be if everyone had 3rd party timers for other stuff.  Not even the best players in the world can time 10 summoners and 9 ultimates down to the second something a 3rd party program could achieve.    Hell why stop there. Time everything.
hmakgie,thisistrashy28919,11/27/2021,1,5.0,soul has 90+ winrate
hm9rnwv,Batman_NEU19,11/27/2021,1,30.0,Don’t disagree with you to an extent but to say the range is super broken is a little bit misleading. Only a few adcs have the range to safely stack lethal in order to get the bonus range (Cait kog jinx maybe aphelios twitch with r come to mind off hand). A champ like twitch would like to have max AS from the rune throughout his ulti like the old rune provided. Overall I think it is mostly a nerf to the rune for adcs and HoB is better in most instances as the attack speed rune which is contrary to what riot supposedly intended. And with it being so powerful on melee bruisers that amounts to an incidental nerf of sorts on everyone else that has to deal with them. We’ll have to see what riot does throughout preseason on it but in its current state and given riots balance history I’m not optimistic that it will be changed in a manner that actually benefits adcs.
hmadddg,marivs69,11/27/2021,1,310.0,you have spent the last few days on this sub writing essays about how upsets family emergency is not actually serious and how maliciously he left the team and his chance to play at worlds which he also spend his entire career working towards.  &#x200B  you need to go outside man im BEGGING you at this point

hm9pybk,Mantias,11/27/2021,1,63.0,He’s quite clearly saying that when performing at his current peak 369 is one of the best carries not that he is currently one of the best carries consistently. JDG would likely be investing in him with the hope that he begins to perform at that level more consistently with experience as he is currently still a young player.
hmav91b,Lucky_Yolo,11/27/2021,1,14.0,O ok thanks.
hma8l50,puu-ukkeli,11/27/2021,1,601.0,Do you think its fair that someone carries noobs every day doesnt give up when Yasuo dies 10 times during lane etc but one day he feels bad and gives up in one game afk farms because of tilt and instantly gets punished for this?
hm9b81k,Voshin,11/27/2021,1,12.0,When you send a ticket if they see nothing particularly wrong I dont think they do.. If you reported after the game then thats when they see the chat logs if it gets to manual review. As much as it is fucked up they literally cant deal with every case of verbal abuse. Theres millions and millions of players using different word variations to avoid detection. The only thing I would suggest is:  1. Either mute all chats from the beginning. 2. If you dont mute from the start as soon as you see someone like that dont feed them they literally are trying to make you mad. Theres no point responding just mute everyone. 3. And if you send tickets again Id suggest screenshoting the actually racist parts. In my 8 years of playing Ive sent 2 tickets because someone was being extremely offensive and twice they got back at me that the person was dealt with.

No.  They couldve kept the mspeed or they couldve removed the slow/nerfed the mspeed/increased the cooldown or lowered the range on the dash reverting it back to 150 units on a 40s of cooldown or something like that.  Right now its absolutely trash and it serves no purpose even Sett/Darius/Garen the most synregistic champions in the game often build something else (Trinity Gore...)

hm8we0v,Peter0629,11/27/2021,1,9.0,You are sitting on 1500 gold and you are somehow lower level than a jungler. Pretty funny watching bad players cry tho go off bro
hmad2j0,delahunt,11/27/2021,1,12395.0,So what I think I love about Arcane is that it is simultaneously both and neithers fault.  There are 2 points where the relationship could maybe have been saved:    * Vi doesnt leave Powder in episode 3 (both die to Silco and Goons most likely)  * Vi stays instead of Ekko in episode 7  Because by the time Vi gets out of Jail Jinx has had years with Silco grooming her. And there is no quick way to get past that. Anything Vi says is going to get twisted. It is going to be near impossible for Vi to convince Jinx she didnt know about the gemstone especially when shes working with a Pilty.  And Vi is looking for Jinx from the get go. That is basically what she is doing from the moment she gets out. She thinks Silco is holding Powder hostage. She doesnt find out until meeting Ekko that Powder is Jinx by choice.  So what you have is Jinx suffering from the fear shes never good enough (all the way from episode 1) and her abandonment complex after episode 3. She is unable to parse what is going on because she just sees Vi choosing something else over her (Caitlyn mostly.)  And Vi is trying to get through to her sister and get time but things keep getting in the way. Or the situation is so fucked its not like she really has a choice. The best time she has to talk to Jinx is when shes tied down and Jinx is already pretty unhinged and jumping from topic to topic while also having the ghosts of Mylo and Claggor ripping into her and twisting everything.  The bridge scene is the only part that is weird to me. Because Vi goes from I cant leave her again to doing just that. Which is weird because the whole plan was Ekko/Caitlyn present the stone to Jayce. And had it been Vi injured badly instead of Cait I could see it better.  But for Vi the tragedy is one moment of weakness - at a very justifiable time - basically sent the only family she had left on a very dangerous path. And Vi is trying to get through but Jinx is *very* far gone even before Silcos death. Thats not something you get through quickly.

hma8ffh,Colactic,11/27/2021,1,314.0,Upsets biggest mistake was to assume all his teammates would be as compassionate as Hyllisang and Yamato.   That wasnt the case and now here we are with this dumbass drama.
hm9ik2j,CoachGiveAdvice,11/27/2021,1,40.0,After all this year a still don’t get why people crave this random map skin. I know I’m gonna get down voted to hell but like. It’s just snow on a map. You’re gonna be « wow super cool » for 2 games and then what ever. And more than half the players didn’t even see it love because it’s been so long. If you wanna see snow okay an aram I guess

hmazii9,Glum_Radio,11/27/2021,1,,Viper include Scout are very rare case in LPL you can’t expect everyone to be like them. And It seem like EDG has a good operation and no Koreans have language problems in the past.
hm9kzvh,MuhammedAlistar,11/27/2021,1,2.0,Not that I disagree but rule of thumb is artillery mages have a 5-15% less damage enchanters are nerfed a lot but still are strong melee champions receive less damage marksmen deal 5-10% less damage and assassins usually have a damage boost.  Then there are annoying champions like Teemo who get huge damage debuff. Basically if you think this is op in champion select then the champion is probably nerfed to the ground.  Honestly ARAM deserves better balancing but the player base isnt big enough for Riot to care.
hm9my6j,TE_silver,11/27/2021,1,171.0,Also consider they maybe could have gotten Nisqy to replace him who is a sidegrade at worst and an upgrade if Rogue decides to give all resources to Hans (or Inspired).

hma6d5n,tanezuki,11/27/2021,1,76.0,Is there any juggernaut that reliably builds this ? Im checking on Lolalytics right now and Im not seeing these items being popular amongst any of them.   Exact item count and then checking the items in build order.   The only outlier Ive seen so far is Garen who has for popular build Mortal Reminder. So entirely different in itself.

hm9wi85,Sbru_Anenium,11/27/2021,1,167.0,This just meant that challenger players made new teams and stomped gold teams. That was only fun for the challengers but destroyed 3v3 in gold-plat elo. Flex queue made gold 3v3 a thousand times better and more fair because challengers wouldnt be in their games anymore (at least not as much).
hmav1jt,ShadyPandah,11/27/2021,1,65.0,Then you haven’t played enough it is absolutely the strongest soul by far and more useful than elder.
hmaust9,andrewboss1222,11/27/2021,1,170.0,There is a reason theres alot of items that dont give the same benefit on ranged users as they do on melee users for example. Being melee means you have a harder time being able to proc the effects. For example grasp is 40 percent effective overall on ranged champs heroic gait from that one axe 1100 gold item that gives you movement speed on hits is half as effective on ranged tempo is rebalanced on ranged etc. Being ranged is a massive strength that needs to be overall balanced by having ranged champs be squishier and on stuff they can proc easier have it be less effective.

Its not like you have to scan through the code for years to find that bug neither was that bug introduced in a big patch that might be connected to some deep engine changes. If youre unable to fix something as easy as that how will you do so for any other champion that is not even on the bugtracker yet?

hm9lous,Ebobab2,11/27/2021,1,20.0,Youre thinking far too black and white there  Ranged champions have a far easier proc condition AND uptime due to the fact that they are ranged. Furthermore they get 100 range which in turn makes it even easier to keep the uptime up.   Then you are ignoring the fact that ranged champions can autoattack far more often than a melee one which in turn leads to melees wasting it vs ranged champions using it to the utmost efficiency
hma9rq6,Potential_Hornet_559,11/27/2021,1,311.0,Or people who have communication skills can actually explain the severity of a situation and the importance without getting into the exact details and still be able to protect their loved ones.  People do it all the time.    It does have to be either/or.  If you looked at Adam and Upsets version of the story there was an obvious disconnect in terms of what Adam felt was communicated vs what Upset felt was communicated.  The whole ‘Upset doesn’t owe Adam’ anything crowd is also ignoring the ‘Adam doesn’t owe Upset anything’ and can tweet whatever the fuck he wants.  And why would you be duo queue with your wife when Fnatic was playing in groups?  Doesn’t upset realize how bad the optics would look?  Just do it on a new account if you need to.

hmamjyu,RaiseYourDongersOP,11/27/2021,1,90.0,I think so but I dont remember. Either way though thats a different kind of experience than Im talking about. Just look at his competition. Its Bwipo Dhokla (who was in LCS and been playing for awhile) and Srrty (on an amateur team I think and is actively trying to go pro it seems like). General Sniper is good in SoloQ but idk if he actually wants to go pro so compared to the competition its hard to tell what will happen.
hm9pgng,AbiwonKenabi,11/27/2021,1,52.0,Makes more sense than Hextech.   Like the other dragons are elements Ive never heard of the element of CHEMTECH. I know they were just trying to incorporate Arcane but cmon. An ARAM map is better suited for that kind of thing not a gameplay change.

hmb2dvg,Reshir,11/27/2021,1,,Its very odd to me that Riot gutted Stridebreaker the way they did.  I dont like it when items completely eliminate a champions weaknesses but over nerfing it so its no longer even an option is just the wrong way to go about it.

Instead of recording the game with their PHONE which is what is shown here just download OBS real quick and record it. In the RECORDING they are still in the game playing.  Or alternatively like you’re trying to say wait for the game to end (which it has now but again that wasn’t the point) and then get a clip from the replay.

hma8xc7,Samsonkoek,11/27/2021,1,,Yeah I totally get you dont want to share everything. But from what we the community have heard from the other players on FNC it looks like the other players didnt even know in the slighest what happend. Then again Upset said he did mention there was stuff going on so I dont know...  However the usual jobs people have is not as emotional close with your colleagues as being a League pro player so Id imagine it is really hard having to build a sort of brotherhood to get on the same page get to know each other and trust and then somebody isnt trusting you (even with a family matter) also just moments before the biggest moment of the year for the players.

hmahpl0,fnlbss,11/27/2021,1,12401.0,You dont get it. There is no jinx/powder dichotomy.  The idea that shes two different people is something she made up just like every other schizo thing shes made up in her head. What Jinx sees throughout the series is completely independent of who she is at the time and not even the color of her eyes played into her freak-out moments which was probably on purpose like most things in this series were because her eyes change color constantly.  The only true cardinal rule behind Jinxs insanity is that \*shes insane\* and theres not much more to it. The shimmer didnt change anything for the good or worse.  Her actions before taking it were no different than her actions after if anything shes just faster/stronger  This really wasnt the case in Parts 1&2 and really makes the bridge scene in part 3 just feel like a serious last minute mess. Her seeing caitlyn smiling at her was one of the most off things for her character in the series. It just doesnt make sense to whats been presented and only reinforces the fact that shes just crazy. Its not ptsd or triggered by anything. Shes just batshit insane. Shes also completely fine with killing littleman who she used it be best friends with.      She 1000% would have shot silco off shimmer.

hmanemz,HazelCheese,11/27/2021,1,11.0,I cant ignore a point the video failed to make.  Axiom Arc is an item you buy when your winning and you want to throw away your lead by wasting gold instead of investing it in good items.  All it did in this video was help Pyke secure a kill he could of gotten faster if he had spent the 3000 gold on a better item instead.  The only champion who really gets a lot of mileage out of Axiom Arc is Nocturne.

hmbbtcf,masterluke05,11/27/2021,1,40.0,There are very few items that provide more offensive stats than Axiom Arc since pretty much all lethality items have vaguely the same statline and Pyke ult generates like an extra 600 gold on killing someone (you get the kill gold AND you AND the person who assisted both get gold sacks.) So it is very hard to argue that Axiom isnt the best item for Pyke to have here with scaling in mind. It is also worth noting that it provides the most raw Ability Haste of any Lethality item so that does translate into some extra mobility and damage from being able to cast more abilities than other items.
hmb5sua,LabHog,11/27/2021,1,28.0,I had the same thing missed my R on a triple and 2 seconds later ulted for a quad on Pyke.

hm9lhp4,TheFlattestStanley,11/27/2021,1,7.0,I have played this game since season 5 and have never ffed a game even when we are 0 kills to 30. You queue up to play a game you damn well finish the game. If you want to play a game where you always win dont play league.
hm9m3wl,MagicSlothYes,11/27/2021,1,37.0,Aphelios if u can understand him any characters moveset is easy to comprehend
hmay5uz,stuffslols,11/27/2021,1,14.0,Why do we need more mana items? Mana .anagement is an important skill and allowing you to circumvent that with items is not a great idea. Better to just change the tear items scaling or better yet leave it there so it can simply be only a bonus to its stats that doesnt change. Its always the same. Nothing wrong with that
hma64sh,Spitfire836,11/27/2021,1,71.0,This is the trend since S11 started. Intend to make something good for ADCs but actually good on melee instead. That’s why people think ADC items are so broken when in reality they are mediocre on ADCs and cracked on the cancer champs like Yasuo Yone Trynd Irelia etc.
hmb4gku,SergioMaia111,11/27/2021,1,30.0,Meh she seems pretty chill. Plus she has so many apparent flaws in her kit that we can easily punish. When playing adc laning with a zyra support is really difficult because she is very selfish her plants can and will push the wave and steal cs and kills. Her plants provide additional gold to the enemy team when killing them and none of her abilities are defensive abilities so you really can’t peel for your adc. In my experience seeing a zyra being played never goes well the adc either gets really mad and quits or rages or she feeds… She was better on the earlier years of league right now she is still a dangerous pick. I know she is doing good for herself right now but it’s still a dice roll whenever we pick her.
hmaj7s5,Gerblinoe,11/27/2021,1,375.0,Fuck didnt now Upset is a doctor and had to literally operate whoever was dying/s  Bro let me tell you medical emergencies in family if youre a medical layman give you a shit ton of free time   Mostly used to worry and spiral into depression

hmb7h8n,Applepowdersnow,11/27/2021,1,10.0,well you can boost your mmr in preseason to get higher faster in the next season.  but ye that can backfire because not everyone takes ranked so serious
hm9ddzz,abuserofnames,11/27/2021,1,5.0,its not consistent on twitch because lethal tempo activates in the last seconds of his R so it doesnt work all the time but it looks cool when the champ actually gets it after 6 attacks xD
hmap4ws,Dan5000,11/27/2021,1,129.0,yea i thought about that myself but if riot was introducing that id think thats lame think of something new. i liked a few other ideas a bit more. mostly breakable walls. how about changing almost every wall to be breakable but depending on how thick they are they need longer to break. so you can easily break through the back of dragonpit but some walls are way too big to even try and attempt it unless you want to hide in your semibroken wall or some shit. but it always has to still feel like league.. dunno how much would be too much. being faster on ice in the river should definitely be backed up by something more^^
hmalrbe,Unfair-Combination51,11/27/2021,1,5.0,Not even an NA thing just a One time one place thing. I would imagine it would extremely hard to hire actors all over the world without running into some liability issues. Not to mention permits in each city covid issues etc...

hm9kh6y,lppur3ps3,11/27/2021,1,166.0,Doesnt particularly sound like hes in contract prison. The only option hed likely go to is EG and if thats the reason EG rejected him then fair enough. Jensen is similar to DL in regards to not wanting to join just any team
hm90teo,flamespear,11/27/2021,1,187.0,I always like seeing their videos. This one legitimately gave me chills but I cant help giggling at the somewhat bad English pronunciation. These guys are copying non human sounds but still make  these weird  English as a second language  mistakes.
hma2un9,delahunt,11/27/2021,1,12388.0,Caitlyn believes in the actual romantic ideal of being a cop. She wants to protect and serve the people. Shes naive at first but once she sees how things are in Zaun she wants to help and fix that. She wants the enforcers to be helping people. She wants peace between Zaun and Piltover.  But with an SMDR hitting the council window as theyre voting for a peace accord that aint happening anytime soon now is it?

hm9xaqg,Oracle_1080,11/27/2021,1,7.0,you sure? I can still see it.
hm8xrte,BBQMasterDad,11/27/2021,1,3.0,New Mundo just feels so much better to play. I think the W is ultimately “worse” (personal preference) but everything about his kit now feels so much smoother and his VFX update was phenomenal.
hmauygg,oski53,11/27/2021,1,262.0,Yeah like jhin
hmaeg8d,Dawegar,11/27/2021,1,4.0,Best advice I can give is play the champs. I learnt to counter urgot by playing him. He has a lot of strengths and power spikes that are different to other champs ie level 13. You won’t understand cool downs when they have kill threat or weaknesses until you test them.

hmathd8,HibariK,11/27/2021,1,9.0,Id advise you to disable chat fully and have some fun league is literally just a game (this coming from a somewhat toxic player myself tho there are lines I dont cross like flaming/bullying new players)
hmb5a6c,drilkmops,11/27/2021,1,206.0,God forbid they have a single second in the game where they don’t shit stomp everyone else because they don’t have their full build yet (zerkers greaves)
hmaxplx,lppur3ps3,11/27/2021,1,4462.0,I have actually. And I agree but I also agree that I havent liked everyone I played with or even liked them enough to share such details. I do feel like its a childish pov to ever expect people to share details like that
hmaeqg3,NeekoBestTomato,11/27/2021,1,,Yeah believe it or not mate...  Something happening to you does not absolve you of the consequences of YOUR actions to THEM  There can be multiple victims in a situation. Thats allowed. Life isnt Black and White.  > It is really not a weird concept to not want to broadcast private issues to the world.  Do you have ANY concept of nuance?  Upset should have communicated better  - SO what you expect a full life story and social security number?  No.... just dont be a fucking dick to the people you already screwed over. Not hard.

hmau1yb,Zeddit_B,11/27/2021,1,19.0,Yeah I had both Spica and Blabber running switched between them a lot. In game one Im pretty sure someone on Spicas team had Blabers stream running... Lol
hmaro9l,lumni,11/27/2021,1,20.0,Well done nice achievement :)  I have two questions:  What are in your opinion the true strengths of skarner compared to other tanky toplaners?  Have you jungled Skarner and if so how does he compare in your opinion as a jungler vs being a toplaner? (Im a jungler and always liked Skarner but I do feel hes a bit too one-dimensional and needs to come online which is not a great thing for a jungle champion)
hmapt77,ralanr,11/27/2021,1,40.0,So they’ll probably nerf it after preseason to bring it in line?

hmagfdy,herptydurr,11/27/2021,1,112.0,Well to be fair...  1. Winter maps are kind of eye cancer so a large number of people dont actually like the re-skin despite liking the *idea* of a re-skinned map.  2. Its only winter in the northern hemisphere. It is actually summer time in the southern hemisphere.  3. Changing the map skin isnt as simple as adding snow everywhere. You have to test the visual clarity of all spells/abilities for each skin at all locations on the map... and for the various different kinds of colorblindness.
hmai29z,SP3EDI,11/27/2021,1,376.0,You have how its done right on the Team. Hily didnt even wanna know the specifics. he trusts upset and knows that family goes before a job/video game.
hmaahs1,ConscienceNot,11/27/2021,1,62.0,I am not gonna bother replying to each specific comment because to everything applies that you are completely clueless. Youdont even fkin play the champion you dont even know such basic thing as that Rengar this season is played into full crit with one lethality item and one mythic lethality item and you try to talk about something that requires understanding.  >q combo... which hasnt been possible for YEARS. You dont even play the game anymore LMAO!  This just killed milions of braincells of whoever read this. Jesus christ. Fk off. You re so wrong its unbelievable and undescribable by words alone. You are so wrong there is no way you actually mean it unless you are paid actor for trolling.  HoB is great and works better than electro in my games. Its raw power is better than electro has better CD and still allows that juicy burst. You wont have better burst midair but most targets either die regardless or survive with more HP than electro does as damage.
hm9kvjm,brokerZIP,11/27/2021,1,7.0,Of course Ahri.

hma27na,Fast_Instruction_286,11/27/2021,1,47.0,No its not a fucking good comparison it would be a slightly better but still shit comparison if it had been about criminals/mentally handicapped being able to vote.  I am not saying average players shouldnt get to vote Im saying hard feeders shouldnt.  And voting for a political party is nowhere near the same as ffing a league game you fucking mong i cant believe I have to explain that to you.
hma7nfk,JesiAsh,11/27/2021,1,9.0,They should add more mana stuff for our runes if they dont want more items. Mana type of... Grasp of Undying or something like that. Something for Domination and Resolve from minor choices... Mana Hunter?

hma5a2z,w23333,11/27/2021,1,147.0,Yes but an appeal to authority isn’t bad a fallacious appeal to authority is bad. For instance saying “I think the vaccine is fine because the scientific community seems it as safe” is an appeal to authority but it’s viable.  But if you say “I think the vaccine is fine because Doublelift thinks so” is a fallacious appeal to authority. Doublelift has no expertise in that area
hmaiy14,Rodniconii,11/27/2021,1,66.0,Just stay ignorant lol its better than knowing.
hmbb6mq,Outfox3D,11/27/2021,1,264.0,I havent been feeling Conq since the most reecent set of nerfs but Im definitely onboard with PTA.  Tempo might be a good pick into a hurricane game where you know your lane is gonna suck anyway or is entirely dependent on supports (the rune **does** feel great with hurricane) and I can see it gaining a little more traction if you can red q your way into the ranged steroid but the one game I messed with it with lethality I felt really weak. I dont think Id ever run it over PTA if you want the option to run collector.
hma6ve6,dtkiu27,11/27/2021,1,145.0,Which would be weird because it was unanimous that fnc best perfomer was bwipoo this worlds.

hm9s2vt,WE-Draz,11/27/2021,1,30.0,50 range for a melee champ is worth much more than 100 for a ranged with 550-600 range tho
hmavcmq,j3b3di3_,11/27/2021,1,84.0,Nunu.... Doesnt matter what lane just build tank and learn to steer the snowball.
hma5nyc,motivatedtuna,11/27/2021,1,2.0,Raging at them doesn’t help them. If they’re doing it on purpose is one thing if they’re dying because they’re getting out matched probably be supportive and maybe they’ll slow down? Idk man

hmal1r5,MoonDawg2,11/27/2021,1,140.0,shieldbow is shit on 90% of adc (exceptions being on-hit builds) because it leaves you with little to no damage but it cant be buffed or changed because its borderline overpowered on cancer bruisers lmao
hm9frcm,RemindZ,11/27/2021,1,77.0,2 and 5 apply in the same way to Twitch Q. Might be that this applies to other champs with stealth than those 2.

hm8y0k3,dannyboyheinz,11/27/2021,1,13.0,As a top laner it helps the games where youre 2/0 with a 30+cs lead and you look botlane and see that theyve fed the opposing carry 15 kills in 10 minutes. My bot/supp might not deserve the bounties but I deserve some sort of comeback mechanic.

hm9m5qg,C00kiz,11/27/2021,1,33.0,And used other keywords than just piltover and zaun
hmb60y9,lul9,11/27/2021,1,452.0,Yea after Russia takes over Ukraine the rest of the Nordic countries will soon follow. Therefore it only makes sense to merge all regions with their Russian overlords.

hmaqi9o,xx11ss,11/27/2021,1,27.0,The pulsefire ez event was the biggest thing ever for league at the time.
hm9s7jv,yehiko,11/27/2021,1,44.0,from you saying what you said i dont think youre understanding my comments. OP says using each region as THE keyword implying they were used as sole keywords (maybe not on purpose) which is why i asked in my original comment if that was the case. /u/Ahrlin4 said how he assumes the AI works which is how i also think it works hence the word EXACTLY. but there are other comments saying that it indeed doesnt look for other related keywords\descriptions which is why i continiued the second part.

hmb1goj,afito,11/27/2021,1,91.0,chemtech dragon (normal ones) already are completely pointless for half the roster namely tanks  its the only dragon in the game that *literally* is purely detrimental for an entire class of champions  everything about chemtech is awful top to bottom dragon effect map effect soul effect all of it is a pure design failure

hmbcxke,nc_bruh,11/27/2021,1,52.0,Yes. All he needs to do is press q then e and then q again. Thats all.  Its gg for everyone in the LoL universe.
hmagsxv,hahanowaitbutyes,11/27/2021,1,116.0,100 range on an adc who already has a shit ton of range is worth a lot more than 50 range on someone who is trying to be on top of you. just because the rune is pathetic on ads comparatively doesn’t mean the range is suddenly better for the jax or irelia leaping on you range is exponentially better the more you have not the other way around. just look at urgot he is basically a melee champion in ranged matchups.
hma8amg,Fitspire,11/27/2021,1,126.0,that tends to happen when you have %max hp on your E and a % MR shred on the procced charm.

hmae8mm,NvmSharkZ,11/27/2021,1,,but Dl is legit wrong here? His analogy sucks.  If youre on a boat with 4 crewmates (teammates) you also have the captain (coach) there and the owners of the ship (management) in the port or wtv.  If you tell the captain that you need to leave give him enough details that he gives you the green light and even encourages you to go and then you even tell the owner of the ship WHY you had to leave and they deem it justifiable why the fuck would the crewmates also need to know? Especially when one of them is a teenager you met 3 months ago.  If the captain and owner of the ship tell the rest of the crewmates that the 5th crewmate really had to leave and they still dont believe it theyre just being insubordinate and disrespecting the captain and owner

hmadbbb,doglop,11/27/2021,1,57.0,No the misconception is fault of Riot themselves changing the meaning of canon every time you ask them. Yes the main event per se is canon but not even rookie can be said to be canon in the big scheme of things. He is canon in the novel but the novel isnt fully canon so....

hm9ctqq,ElBigDicko,11/27/2021,1,359.0,Both servers like any other are toxic. You never played on both if you have this opinion. From my experience EUW is way more toxic especially at master+. There are very few toxic players on EUNE in that elo which cannot be said about EUW.
hm9sreh,acylase,11/27/2021,1,226.0,I loved this series it was well beyond that I expected from this stupid game (checks the sub name - o what the hell) but these ridiculous braids just rubbed me wrong way all the time I noticed them - what an incredibly inconvenient stylistic choice for all the physical confrontations!

hmavsw7,12Xenomorphing21,11/27/2021,1,6.0,I know some of the names on them are messed up the whole process was so long and there is no way to change the name once youve named it. So i just decided to leave them as is. You can see the names I referenced in the bottom left

hmb6srh,tyrelltsura,11/27/2021,1,33.0,its kinda crazy just how much admin abuse goes on in this server and tyrell doesnt even bother hiding it at this point. When I think about Randojoe I get the uncontrollable urge to simp for him. I know I was going to win Joes heart and if that had happened Joe wouldve been happy forever and Tyrell knew that and had to find a way to stop that from happening so the admin team could keep him for themselves. And if you think Randojoe deserves anything but the best then youre sadly too far gone to be saved   Also btw allowing srtty to have kennen is 100% griefing.
hmaldox,henluwu,11/27/2021,1,17.0,refillable is 200 less hp than 3 pots its not worth the risk since bot matchups are really volatile and basing early could mean losing a wave which already means you lost the value from buying refillable.
hm9kg8x,FactAndLogic,11/27/2021,1,87.0,Is this the result of 200 years of experience?
hmaqzl3,mattiejj,11/27/2021,1,2.0,Very cool but why would you work two years on a cosplay and then show us a picture that barely shows off the work youve done?
hm9mc28,mitozzy,11/27/2021,1,58.0,369s only advantage is his age. He is not one of the best carries in the LPL man cmon.
hma6d13,greekcel_25,11/27/2021,1,29.0,I can understand nuguri is probably homesick going through some rough stuff on FPX and possibly not as hungry for a repeat as some of the FPX players are but giving up on the championship after 1 split and then just not talking or listening to your team is toxic af for a team environment. Dude is probably getting a 7 figure salary just do your best ffs.
hma3va6,csudoku,11/27/2021,1,9.0,Let people like what they like just play something different I quit this game like 2 years ago. LoR and TFT are pretty good though like there is other content. Yeah League isnt the same as it was a decade ago duh thats why I stopped playing it simply not the same game I used to enjoy and thats ok.
hm9dvxt,the3stman,11/27/2021,1,71.0,Theres probably way better cosplay out there
hmasygt,jayquanderulo,11/27/2021,1,10.0,There will always be people telling you how bad you are. Just like when you watch the pro’s stream and yell at Diamond and Masters players.   Everyone is constantly making mistakes in the game they just like to hyper focus on others. Just mute people and play the game. It seriously feels way better.
hm955pt,LoLrovex,11/27/2021,1,219.0,If youre playing at 190+ ping you definitely get to choose from like 3 champions. Once your ping goes above 70 itll start correlating with performance pretty heavily.
hma81ev,Oreo-and-Fly,11/27/2021,1,86.0,Maybe create walls in the jungle that can be destroyed   Or opposite of cloud drake a slowing field that generates based off combat in the field.   Maybe bushes turn into frozen grass that damage if you go in but give a buff to the next attack/ability in 5 seconds.

hm99uir,Voshin,11/27/2021,1,6.0,Hate speech definitely a problem. But it also depends what you consider as hate speech nowadays everything can be seen as hate speech it seems even tho it can simply be speech you hate (the 2 are different). If what you reported to Riot is this one screenshot how is it hate speech? We have no context. Maybe he was drawing a conclusion based on what hes seen not necessarily promoting it. Maybe he was saying that as a *unfortunately* racism always wins with the unfortunately implied. We have no clue since we have no background.   Anyway yes its a problem not everything you dont like is hate speech.

hmaxeev,Applepowdersnow,11/27/2021,1,6.0,you can actually make out ziggs throwing a bomb in his picture! i love them!
hmb7ef7,TeeTheSame,11/27/2021,1,264.0,In a front to back teamfight you start stacking it on the enemy frontline and after you stacked it you have a much easier access to priority targets thanks to the range. Thats how adc teamfighting works. Its super rare for you to hit priority targets from the get go in a fight. Obviously it synergizes well with other AS buffs like Kraken and PD to get the stack going and on champs with AS steroids like Trist and Twitch.
hmazeli,podvu,11/27/2021,1,24.0,Really impressed with the level of play and production! Hyped for Bwipo vs Gen Sniper today

hmadlfq,TrashAllRoles,11/27/2021,1,13.0,Draft is better in my experience stopped playing blind pick a long time ago.  As for getting better experience is obviously the largest thing over time youll learn the ins and outs of each champion and how to play scenarios. Watching high level players that play your role or champion will also help
hm9op0y,ironstarke,11/27/2021,1,35.0,would be nice to see. others have also suggested LJL
hma6aez,MrZeral,11/27/2021,1,203.0,Dude I returned after 5 years break and I still see some guys on ym friendlist in bronze or sivler literally the same rank they were 5 and more years ago. Blows my mind but I guess some people just dont have the skill.
hmar6xv,DigBickBroly,11/27/2021,1,138.0,Super team nowadays just means A strong looking team that *might* win a lot for a lot of people. Its why VIT TL or the BLG team that no one actually knows how itll look like are called super teams too even though the true super teams from the past like 2017 KT were much much stronger on paper.
hmaep6o,introspectionman,11/27/2021,1,215.0,Okay I won’t dismiss the stats — if I want to win worlds or even get very far I don’t want to invest an incredibly large buyout for someone who has a 45% winrate at worlds. I’d rather take my chances on someone else who has been historically better regionally Bjergsen or even go with fresh talent vs recycling someone who’s biggest achievement is getting out of groups.

hm8ynf7,Zlera-Kilc-odi,11/27/2021,1,199.0,Yes us Talon mains definitely need him to be disabled for the foreseeable future! Im definitely not a salty support main who underestimates the enemy Talon and overestimates my own!

hmaapdy,ADeadMansName,11/27/2021,1,368.0,Alphari > Wunder in 2021. Wunder >= Alphari in 2019/2020  Razork = Selfmade (based on year. Razork had a great year but it doesnt have to stay like that. Selfmade had a better year before and then a terrible split with FNC).  The rest I agree on.

hmaylr7,Gerblinoe,11/27/2021,1,398.0,And you dont know what the situation is and yet blindly insist nothing big happened  I know it was big enough for Upset to pack his bags over night and go back home after grinding for over 4 years to get to worlds sounds kind of serious  And I have no opinions on if and how he should have told Adam because like you said we dont know what happened    But to try to use he played arams with his wife as an argument it wasnt that serious shows a lack of empathy and just knowledge about how people work

hm8vow7,LezBeHonestHere_,11/27/2021,1,19.0,Most annoying thing to me about this quirk is dying as Orianna while trying to get your ult off. The whole spin animation plays and then does nothing. At least it doesnt use your ult cooldown if I remember correctly.

hmabape,Fragrant_Violinist26,11/27/2021,1,8.0,I don’t mind the concept but can we talk about how insane these numbers are? Could you imagine being able to suddenly slap 200+ armor mr and Ad with ms and as on an adc that primarily just right clicks anyways.

hmau4il,TokaiTeio0420,11/27/2021,1,106.0,I dont get the reason they call it Novembers capsule and make it available from 11/30 to 12/30. I mean there is a much better way for them and for the players for example i would have preferred the case they called it Decembers capsule and made it available to claim on 11/30 so people would say Riot is the best company in the world.  They could start with the first capsule been available on the 30th of October and call it Novembers capsule and then give this second one on 30th of November and call it Decembers capsule.  Nothing actually changes to them but the public opinion would have been much different![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)

hmau74q,Yetti2Quick,11/27/2021,1,305.0,Low elo is more of a coin flip on getting teammates that want to win or have the skill to win. You literally have to carry almost every game. If he’s not in a high carry role it takes longer. That’s why mid was his fastest challenger climb as he could roam easily and carry his opponents. Also the high mmr accounts will have jacked up LP gains. He was on a fresh account he leveled so he was literally getting 13-18lp like most of us haha.
hm9p2jt,CiezkoCosWymyslec,11/27/2021,1,408.0,Id transfer to EUW but then Id be unable to play with my friends and I have no patience to level to 30 again.
hma3eic,ArchdevilTeemo,11/27/2021,1,13.0,Nobody forces them to not play the game but saying the game is great is also wrong.  I also play lol for a long time but mostly because of friends & because there just arent many games out there that are fun long time.  However if you like arcane and are interested into the characters legends of runeterra is a much better game.

For example Doinb members have said he is quite serious off stream and it is just a character. Even when they playfully blame each other on stream they never flame Nuguri.

Im also stuck in Gold 2 but I managed to climb gold 1 and that is the only rank I managed to climb   But I badly want to play league of legends again. :)

I think for me its just like I mentioned before in the post I dont really have an outlet to help me with my mental issues or anger issues. I just have gaming and occasionally talking to people on discord. Im trying to get into writing but my motivation issues have kind put me at a standstill. Im trying to work through them but its been tough recently.
hmaknny,Pure_Void,11/27/2021,1,13.0,losing 15 out of 20 games is tuff i would recommend either taking a break or playing different game mode like aram in my eyes gets boring quick but i know some ppl only play it and have fun but try playing 5v5 once in a while maybe that will help since its a diff way of how the game is played out

hm93aie,weirdfishes505,11/27/2021,1,26.0,You can trade objectives (give drag to get tower bounties) and punish late enemy rotations if you have a strong side-laning champion like Trynd or Yorick.  It just punishes poor team coordination and ARAMing from the winning team and adds more strategy which is good I think.

You dont need shit ever when it comes to League. Many players use the new account technique and get pretty crazy results (Diamond in 100 games for example).

hmajlds,slfthrowaway12345,11/27/2021,1,79.0,I watched the documentary in Chinese. Seems like they are just trying to pin problems on Nuguri this whole time. It was said in interviews that Nuguri acted this way on DK too. He is just an extremely antisocial dude and had a history of getting bullied - there is no way FPX management didnt know this prior to acquiring him. There were so many problems with FPX this year but I guess hes the perfect scapegoat since hes not coming back to the LPL anymore. Is it his responsibility as an adult to own up to his decision of coming to China and doing the best he can to live up to his 7-figs salary? Absolutely and he should have done better to overcome his demons but if anyone thinks its only his fault and doesnt think this is a problem with the coaching staff & management you have not been following what FPX was like this year.  I just feel terrible for Tian. There were so many awkward clips of him trying to cheer up Nuguri throughout the video & him getting ignored throughout the documentary lmfao.  Also if anyones gonna talk about stuff like Nuguri not willing to learn Chinese to communicate with the team I fully agree that players like Tarzan/Viper who went from not knowing Chinese to being able to shotcall in comms within a matter of months are fking fantastic but expecting everyone to become fluent in Chinese in a few months while practicing League 16+ hours a day is not realistic. Keep in mind even TheShy was not fluent in Chinese and had to rely on Rookie to translate in game during S8 and IG was able to win at Worlds sooooooo...again could Nuguri have done better? I agree he could have. But is becoming fluent & being able to shotcall a realistic expectation? I dont think so.

hmal162,SkeletonJakk,11/27/2021,1,115.0,based
hm9d04c,aluxmain,11/27/2021,1,8.0,its not simple to genralize but usually if you got bot T1 tower (tier1/the first one) you want to move mid and thake their T1 also there then the top T1 then some T2 towers.  you want to get the most external tower first because its less risky you dont want to take T1->T2->T3 bot while T1 mid is still up.  since T3 towers (inibitor one) are easier for enemy team to defend you want to get baron to get those.  this doesnt mean that to win you should look to get every single existing tower i tried to generalize so try to take smart decisions.  usually to end the game you need to take at least 2 inibitors if you already got one is better to push another lane and get a second inibitor compared to just push the opened lane and hope to get nexus towers.  tip: after you get one tower your minions get a bit stronger so its easier to keep the lane pushed so you push a bit and move to another lane to take other objectivs.
hmagr4h,WintersEnvoy,11/27/2021,1,6.0,I could explain winrate:      Wins over losses   Probable on your case: recent winrate last 400 games: 50 %   winrate total 52 % in 800 games probably because a significant chunk was played in lower than your current elo.     A wild guess youve probably climbed a 100 or 200+ lp the last few dozen games climbed a lot but not really proved to the ingame system you deserve your current rank. Hence it wants you to win more than you lose to prove you deserve to be here and win even more if you want to climb even higher than the system thinks you deserve. Why? Because your winrates probably not very good the last 400 games and most of thsoe games were probably played in lower rank than what you are currently in because you probably climbed a lot recently.        MMR is very torqued. If you win the next 28/50 games youre gonna be the same rank youre now but the system is gonna give you as much as you are losing in LP per win/loss (probably) or if you derank a bit the system might give you more than you lose per win because you managed to raise the mmr higher than what you derank to.
hmaojru,Jstin8,11/27/2021,1,28.0,They also get to turn you into a walking HP pot with Sunderer and Lyandries makes you wonder why you even bother buying MR in the first place.  Its a two pronged problem.   (Also Randuins sucks such massive dick can we please get a revert on that item?)

And the only reason we got suddenly better winrate and also elo was that the new account got matched with better people which doesnt make sense on the paper - we should be losing more being vs somebody better but it got rid of all afkrs trolls and so on so we started climbing rapidly.

hm94aj9,1nc000,11/27/2021,1,16.0,Yeah I mean what I see is completely balanced you are 2/3 and underleveled + 1500G vs a Kayn with his mythic + tabis who is ahead in levels.  Not to mention that you could’ve played that 15 times better I’m not gonna go into detail just stop complaining
hma0tk7,delahunt,11/27/2021,1,12378.0,One of the people who worked on Arcane talked about this on twitter. Vi/Cait arrive at Caits house in the morning. Theyre both battered/bruised/exhausted/frayed. They dont present to the council until that night. What happens in between - that then leads Cait to do the what about us? line - is up to the viewer (they wouldnt go into season 2 spoilers.)  Someone else pointed out Cait does her thinking in the shower and the shower is where she is remembering Vi and the lost relationship so maybe they had a shower together off screen?  Unfortunately with Tencent owning Riot the China market being a huge target and how expensive animation is it is unlikely we get anything explicit on show to cement a Cait/Vi relationship either way.
hmb1zpe,theuwudragon,11/27/2021,1,165.0,Their old arguments of competitive integrity and gameplay readability have also been thrown out the window since Rise of the Elements when each game the whole map would change in 1 of 4 elemental variants.
hm98xwx,DarkLightning95,11/27/2021,1,37.0,Give me TES with Zoom/WeiWei/Knight/Uzi/Crisp/Ming so I can see domination in the LPL

hmaa4ge,tortillakingred,11/27/2021,1,70.0,Me fuckin too man. I miss Zeyzal so much. He was one of my favorite players in the league and I always felt like he was such a relatable player in game.
hm95s49,n1gro609,11/27/2021,1,18.0,Any news on how to fix this issue? I ENABLED hardware acceleration in Spotify and Steam to move some load from CPU to GPU and turned fullscreen optimization and run-as-admin-option back ON for LoL. It seems this helped just a little bit but the problem still occurs sometimes.
hmbe2d8,KogMawOfMortimidas,11/27/2021,1,,Shieldbow was the least picked mythic of the trio at worlds? I counted it up in [a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/qdn9nb/camille_seriously_needs_to_be_addressed/hhpl256/) a while ago Galeforce had an overwhelming majority while Kraken and Shieldbow were roughly equal.
hmax12l,idlemachinations,11/27/2021,1,65.0,Sion is balanced for his mechanic no other champs have revive after death as part of the balancing equation.
hmbf7up,vegeful,11/27/2021,1,,But people will say Riot Tos has no right under EU law. Boom checkmate.   People will complain for the sake of complain. Just like how people still say valorant has a malware anti cheat. Peoppe are just that dumb.
hmagty9,YoungAnimater35,11/27/2021,1,9.0,I was handling him thats not the problem he was 0/6 at like 15 min but when I rotated to mid or bot or drag to help my team he just took plates and towers. I got his summs multiple times and took both towers in my lane but EVERYTIME I tried to help my team he just split and I couldnt be in 2 places at once. I didnt know what to do.

hmaa39a,FantasyTrash,11/27/2021,1,311.0,Have you ever considered the people are allowed to choose which private matters they share with their job? As long as your manager (or in this case Yamato/Dardo) know there is no obligation for you to share any further if you choose not to and that should be respected.  Because when it’s not respected we get posts like Adam’s and opinions from players like Doublelift which is the very thing Upset wanted to avoid. Just because you’re a public figure doesn’t mean you can’t have privacy.
hmb28dh,Lifedeather,11/27/2021,1,91.0,Ancient as in elder right?
hmast3j,KasumiGotoTriss,11/27/2021,1,84.0,They were added this preseason chemtech drake and hextech drake
hmb0zib,johnnyxmas16,11/27/2021,1,16.0,I tried reverse boosting on ARAM doesnt seem to work. Mmr on old accounts is fucked. Every now and then riot will hand you an easy win usually after a long break from the game
hmas37r,Nyte_Crawler,11/27/2021,1,90.0,After 2018? They absolutely did it was a topic at the time. Also keep in mind that this was right after GGs first year. They immediately wanted to make moves that in the communitys eyes would say that they arent a bottom feeder since they finished 10th both splits.

hma0xno,MyGasYourBrain,11/27/2021,1,53.0,This is 100% getting nerfed for melee on a bruiser with CC and/or dashes (all bruiser) its to strong. I dont get the adc hate in the comments here the position is the weakest of all 5 atm. Even if you snowball early the enemy top with average farm can still shut you down in seconds in the midgame. As a top main I feel like it doesnt matter if my botlane gets stomped if the enemy ADC doesnt have 10++ kills and perfect farm in the midgame I just kill them over and over (lul).
hmaxzep,gravy3000,11/27/2021,1,12407.0,You probably havent seen many...

hmaelqo,GamingDifferent,11/27/2021,1,58.0,If youre new like fresh new you can play against bots. Intermediate still can be a bit fun to play against. Or you can try to befriend the guys who play good and ask them for friendly 1v1 where they teach you stuff. There a subreddit called summonerschool and LoL discord server might help you find a mentor.

hm9g2ij,AlHorfordHighlights,11/27/2021,1,12362.0,On the other hand Caitlyn already doesnt believe Jinx can be redeemed so its a perfect motivation for her to hunt her down and sets up an interesting conflict with Vi

hmai1eo,EvyLuna,11/27/2021,1,295.0,It was quite a while ago so it is quite possible. The upper ranks are likely a bit different though I would imagine the rest is largely true. Players have largely improved over the years but thats across the board so the gap wouldnt be much different in theory.
hma6cji,DeusVitae69,11/27/2021,1,73.0,You’re gonna have to speak up!!
hmbbedw,yasuud,11/27/2021,1,263.0,The nerf may not have exclusively been for ranged users but it was targeted mainly at marksmen using it here’s riots blurb on that nerf:    “Hail of Blades has risen in prominence among marksmen providing quick trades with a high uptime compared to other runes. We’re sharpening its intended weakness as a front-loaded skirmish tool by increasing its cooldown.”
hmaomgo,xantolu,11/27/2021,1,9.0,I think theres been a typo assassins dont have a damage boost theyre fucking monsters able to one shot absolutely everyone even if theyre behind/dont know how to play the champ.

hma2ggk,F0RGERY,11/27/2021,1,149.0,Thats because they were comments by randoms on Reddit.  Doublelift gets credibility as:  A. A pro player in the scene that has experience in a pro team environment.  B. Someone who personally experienced an extreme family trauma that interfered with his ability to play.  C. Someone who has attended worlds before and knows how much getting to Worlds would mean to a player.  even if the message is the same as what others have said before.

hma6hqy,FallingIntoSound,11/27/2021,1,145.0,As Doublelift said Upset didnt need to go into specifics but just looking the people whove youve worked with all year in the eye and telling them you must go because of a critical family issue wouldve circumvented this drama all together probably

hmaw2ia,Barangat,11/27/2021,1,609.0,So I am one of these bums who got seduced by Arcane to come back. Was off the game for minimum 5 years. I know the basics but am pretty lost on most details like runes itemisation and all the new champs. Any good ressources to bring me up to speed? Also my fav champs back in the day were  Top: Riven Renekton Nasus Jax  Mid: Zyra  Support: Soraka  Jungle: Nautilus Jax Warwick  Are they still ok Picks or did they get powercreeped?
hmalsd1,speciof,11/27/2021,1,12.0,who cares  her skin is too pale to be an actual korean therefore europe deserves the icons too because her features define more a european than a korean koreans are tanned and ahri is not  also she has blue eyes in like half her skins
hm91qme,Leyrann_is_taken,11/27/2021,1,328.0,I dont think thats true. Ive played enough on Frankfurt servers before the move to Amsterdam that Id recognize that ping immediately.
hmaqvpr,_imrahulyadav,11/27/2021,1,71.0,So are there any flashy champion that you recommend to play?
hmapg61,REPORT_JUNGLE,11/27/2021,1,49.0,when i first started people recommended warwick to me because he is easy but after just one game i got bored of him. so dont go for easy champs they get boring fast (like garen) ! better go for fun champ and since you like toplane tanky bruisers i would go for sett !
hmaur7e,AmarilloCaballero,11/27/2021,1,203.0,Easy because Liquid was the biggest last I checked and didnt check it was still the case until after the initial comment.

hmawxyi,Luchus_Brutus,11/27/2021,1,170.0,It was 57% global winrate at Diamond 2+ and was heavily inflated by China and Korea two regions that are notorious for calling open really early on. He had a ~52% winrate in NA and around a 54% winrate in EU at that same time.

hmawtd0,Vinvillivix,11/27/2021,1,502.0,Well there is a good chance in the world of Runeterra crazy hair colors are natural. Why? Magic Or more specifically the World Runes they altered everything so its not far fetched to think that also includes humans genome. So now you got babies being born with blue pink and white hair.

hmaskp5,lolzomg123,11/27/2021,1,2.0,Having played Phase rush in ARAM into an Ahri....    The slow being weaker would make her pick potential (with a group) stronger as you legit just run into her team while unable to do anything but weaker when shes solo.
hm9nmw8,Till-Tiny,11/27/2021,1,173.0,What I meant is that they were not so popular I got sick of their music and their sound. I kinda liked them as a  young teenager. I still dont mind their music tbh. Therrs far worse than them.

hmae8fv,SP3EDI,11/27/2021,1,,it was communicated. But they demanded to know the specific reasons what the management could not give them because it would go against german laws to do that without upsets direct approval.   I can understand that they wanted to know more but at the end of the day they trow childish tantrums and even post false claims on the internet to direct hate to upset.

The most creative imo is Fiddlesticks and kindred Fiddle is for his assimetric looks and the way hét moves just shows how much care it took to create and kindred for the lamb+wolf 2 in 1 design and the whole concept in general

Like even saying it was like medical issue or a grief issue is enough. You can’t tell them literally nothing with no advance.

It works fine on a plethora of ADCs like ApheliosKalista and Dravenbut is simply more situational in the same vein as Galeforce   >LDR is shit because of the build path and that it just doesnt do enough damage most of the time. Check the stats on when its build second or third its horrid.    W h a t  The item is quite literally one of the strongest second items in terms of damage and has an insane scaling to boot.

hma3svr,Koersfanaat,11/27/2021,1,149.0,True. This would have never been a drama if Upset had handled it professionally from day 1. Explain yourself clearly to your team PR sends out private issues to the fans and with support from the team mates they would have accepted it. No team mates mental booming or putting out twitlongers and thats it. Now its just such a mess that only putting out the truth to the public would resolve everything. It isnt our business but he has created this shithole himself.

hmavyuj,ColdXStrikeR,11/27/2021,1,65.0,Well obviously that kind of scaling comps have decreased. But also think about it this way the best champions over the last couple of seasons have been champs that either ignore items and spike out of their mins no matter what at a certain lvl or champs that spike at 1 at the very most 2 items. If you need 3 items to play the game you are barely a champion. Thats why they invented mythics get 1 item for your large power and a legendary item to supplement that and you done.  Also on a somewhat related topic the logic of well if you are far enough ahead you should be able to secure the drake and win the game. So what if you arent. You are barely ahead like one teamfight win ahead of the enemy team and its soul time and you know if they get the drake (its 3 each) they get something busted like the chemtech soul. And they end up getting it cuz of some lucky smite or w/e and they end up winning the game. That used to be a wincondition for elder drake but if its hex soul its a whole 6 mins earlier in the game you need to go all in.  Idk I just dont like those all in mechanics. + its a dumb argument tonsay if you are far enough ahead you should have a clear way of winning. Bitch if you are far enough ahead to be able to secure a soul/elder without trouble you are also far enough ahead to march down enemy base and win the game.  Idk its all this 1 way logics I have a problem with if I am gonna be real.

hmb92r0,moodRubicund,11/27/2021,1,,Does he actually have involvement in most stories? Hes mostly on his own doing his own thing.  Also I honestly dont think that was Ryze who gave Jayce the stone. Mostly because he gave Jayce a stone which is not a very Ryze thing to do. Plus hes not blue? And he doesnt have a scroll? Really the only thing tying that random mage to Ryze is teleportation magic which apparently anyone can learn given how Jayce managed to repurpose it for his hexgates.

hmb82eh,CarefulConsequence2,11/27/2021,1,15.0,Brother im sorry youve gone through that. Definitely for me Ive also experienced that and have always been hoping that the community becomes better in terms of just showing respect even when people make mistakes in the game. If you really want to keep playing  the game go for it but I really recommend muting all so you can enjoy the game without anyone telling you did something wrong. This can help you improve your game too! However if you feel the toxicity is too much and trust me Iv been there Its just best to leave the game and find something where you wont be exposed to constant toxicity. What I do is I dont play the game anymore but I still enjoy watching streamers play and keep up with news like on Reddit. Whatever you decide good luck my dude and dont let toxicity get you down. Stay strong brother

hma4wrc,SovereignType,11/27/2021,1,13.0,The game is just bad... Riot are obsessed with damage and aggression and making the game into Fornite with quick boring matches and the same overpowered champions. I always tell my friends not to play it unless they are edgy teenagers that want to lash out because their parents told them to clean their room.  Arcane is also a way for Riot to distract people from their numerous sexual harassment lawsuits coming down the pipeline.

hm9l8qb,Esxos,11/27/2021,1,38.0,The music choices kicked me out of the mood entirely. Its not that the songs are bad or anything theyre great in their own right. They just didnt merge with the world at all. It was like the opposite of bebop where the entire world is basically jazz so the music is jazz. Feels like they wanted the show to resonate with this kind of pop music but didnt add the culture of it in the world itself so it felt disconnected.      The exception is jinxed but I think that one mostly fit cause it was playing from a radio and didnt take the spotlight from jinx herself when it was playing.     I dunno. Maybe its  the fact the show was so good it didnt need music with lyrics to support it.  Or it could because they put something nice (the music) next to something great (the rest of the show) making nice look meh by comparison.

hmalkog,goblin0100,11/27/2021,1,,Bruh she is literally a Kumiho and her name is Korean...  >The Kumiho (구미호) or Gumiho* is a nine-tailed fox spirit. In Korean tradition foxes that have lived for a thousand years accumulating a great deal of energy turn into Kumiho.  >The Kumiho has the supernatural ability of transforming into a human—usually a beautiful woman. Though able to shape-shift there is still something quintessentially fox-like about a Kumiho even in human form. A Kumiho in human form might have foxy features pointed ears hidden beneath flowing locks or nine tails that only become evident when a wedding dress is removed. Though able to change between human and fox forms a Kumiho carefully guards its true identity.

Thats gonna be a fucking massive buyout. If they cant get Hang their best option available is gonna be to keep Zhuo which honestly isnt that bad anyways. Zhuo is solid and super young. Im operating under the assumption that Missing does NOT one of the players leaving if the rumor of a couple WE players leaving is true. If Missing leaves then that could be a pretty hype signing for TES.

hm9v6wd,SaulJoker,11/27/2021,1,22.0,What the fuck are you talking about?  My point is that if the OP was going to record the live game they should have just used OBS.  Your point is that they should just wait for the game to end and record it through the replay which is fine and I agree with but since OP chose to record the game live they clearly didn’t have that as an option at the time.  Again I hope you’re trolling me.

I said they have no right to know anything beyond family emergency. If they trust him and Yamato it should be enough. And he clearly was right in not giving them any further info if Adam is so willing to spew bullshit and made up scenarios in his head because he thinks he deserved more information as well as seeing how everything leaks inside the League scene. Even without Adams twitlonger it wouldve gotten out anyways the less people know about it the less likely it is to leak.  >they dont need to know or they dont deserve to know  Both. Glad we agreed.

There are a lot more countries who refuse to speak english on EUNE mainly polish/turks/czech/slovenians/arabs and the cases of it are a lot more common compared to just a few instances like those on EUW that i had.   For reference I played on EUNE since s3-s8 when i transfered to EUW and im there since then while also holding an alt on EUNE both being low elo so myb the situation is better on eune/worse on euw in high(er) elos.  >In terms of skill below masters its always a coinflip as youll get carried-by-champ wannabe solo carries mute magnets and other toxic or clueless players on all servers.

hm95eg3,Bilisticbiscuit,11/27/2021,1,63.0,I think its a pretty good guess that this insanity potion is some kind of improved shimmer. From arcane we can see shimmer has some huge effects on people once it wears off. Its kinda a stretch but since singed suffers no negative effect after using his ult i think you could reasonably say he’s iterated on shimmer in some way and without silco’s marketing decided just to call it insanity potion. I doubt signed was the one pushing shimmer in zaun so why would he care if the name is good or not.

hmac0kj,Odd_Play_5769,11/27/2021,1,83.0,The 100 range isnt that broken especially considering you have to auto in your initial attack range to get it. with how much engage there is today especially with predator meta there are very rarely games where you can utilize that extra 100 range fully. Its strong in theory but jn practice at least in the games Ive played not yet.   Whereas a melee can get 90% attack speed level 1 and this attack speed is permanent so long as they keep autoing a champ.   Im not sure where OP is getting his information because according to patch notes the implication is lethal was changed to be viable for melee champs not so it would be better on ADCs. It was already perhaps the unironic most balanced rune in the game before it was reworked. Shame it changed

hm962nx,Amsement,11/27/2021,1,199.0,Again I dont recall any instance of LS saying he thinks Jensen is a bad player. I watched his costreams and he generally criticized Jensens laning but never called him a bad player. The reoccurring opinion LS has had on Jensens laning in both Facechecks and his individual streams is that Jensens laning looks like hes just clocking in for a job. He literally said he thinks Jensen has better teamfighting and camera control than most other mids in LCS so he clearly doesnt think that Jensen is just completely bad. If you find an instance of LS saying Jensen is a bad player then share it. So far all youve guys have done is downvote and claim that x and y has been said without providing any real examples of when these things were supposedly said. I havent heard LS say anything about Jensen his peers havent also said aside from perhaps his worlds performance.   > Also same caliber/potential implies that he doesnt think he is a top player in the region at all. Id like to see what players hes talking about and check in and see if they have comparable accomplishments as jensen.  No it doesnt. Gori and Fate are two players LS mentioned that would at the very least give you the same performance as Jensen did this year if not better. They also wouldnt cost as much as he does. This argument about accomplishments is such a shallow one considering that were options that compete in a far stronger league than Jensen does.

hmanpwv,Exclarius,11/27/2021,1,,> Which makes YOUR defence of why Upset didnt talk to Adam and everyone else invalid. Glad you understand.  How? How does it make it invalid? Once again Upset decides who he communicates details to. He communicated. He did not communicate details to people like Adam. Thats all there is to it. It is literally that simple. If you (or Adam) feel like you need to know someones life story thats fine. It doesnt mean that they have to tell it to you (or Adam).  > Nobody did that here so another strawman.   If you check the quote replies on Upsets tweet which language are the harassing tweets (mostly) written in? Which nationality does Adam have? Ill give you a hint: Its the same. That is not a coincidence :)

I was hoping OP would have some ideas for why these changes happened particularly with maybe referencing the new items or game changes such as the new comeback mechanics introduced or the new dragons instead of just strawmanning with why do people consider vayne balanced.   OP mentioning kraken slayer silver bolts and saying it seems like without even citing the winrate they are supposedly upset about indicates to me that OP hasnt given the topic much thought themselves aside from recent anecdotal experience.

hmbacro,Outfox3D,11/27/2021,1,264.0,I mean ... yes and no. Yes if you could start the game teamfighting it would be a significantly stronger rune but it gives you a laughably small amount of power in lane. Theres nothing to wind up on no easy access to the range steroid for short trades and it doesnt give you enough of a combat steroid to compete in an all-in scenario.   Even in a teamfight no its terrible on Twitch - who spends long periods out of combat repositioning and usually wants a swift burst of damage during his ulti. He doesnt use the rune well. And Trista ... well its an alright choice but shell never part with Hail of Blades as long as it remains strong. Also while her steroid is huge her base AS is low and she wouldnt wind up the rune all that fast (or benefit as much from the bonus AS it offers - but no one really does) even with her Q up.  Also I dont even think the rune is the best choice in a true front to back. PTA is a stronger steroid if you dont need the extra range. Its a rune for the weird hybrid case where you want to start in a front to back and then pivot mid fight (without leaving combat) to a non-front to back. Or I guess it assumes you kill their tank before they kill yours ... but with a worse tank-busting rune? Its just so weird and niche and IMO the ideal situation for the rune doesnt hsppen often enough in game ro justify it in a game where you could pick a laning rune and just carry a lead.
hmaqb1g,MoonDawg2,11/27/2021,1,139.0,Because put it on a role where most of its relevant damage comes from the raw AD of autos instead of abilities and has horrible scaling with levels. also dont forget being overshot in damage most of the time so the shield isnt as relevant as youd think and the lifesteal mostly sucks if you dont have big burst go brr ability which doesnt happen till your 3rd item unless again youre a bruiser who can just spam their shit for free (irelia yasuo yone best examples). The item just fucking sucks on every adc minus on-hits  Theres a reason theres more none adc shieldbow users than in the actual role.

hm9lxue,howtopayherefor,11/27/2021,1,10.0,In the last URF gamemode mana is converted to HP. So a solution could be to have adaptive conversion on mana (to AD AP or HP whichever is relatively higher) for manaless champions

hm96c84,musashihokusai,11/27/2021,1,40.0,Don’t fight em. Track him and be where he won’t be. Only take major objectives as a team.   He has no answers to good poke or kiting.   It’s just asymmetrical gameplay. You wouldn’t try and match a full build Fiora splitplush 1v1 right? Similar deal.
hmaglui,sfsctc,11/27/2021,1,605.0,Viego and yone are both worth trying out if you think they seem fun. I run yone top but he can go mid too kinda bad matchups but you can take really unfair trades and farm to get really strong as the game goes on. Viego is just plain fun you get to play as every champ and his core kit isn’t particularly hard
hm9thwx,TH3RM4L33,11/27/2021,1,242.0,Im not talking about projectiles being dodged thats completely different. Talons Q has no projectiles nor does it act like one. Im talking about the cast being cancelled aka the little animation that lasts 0.25 seconds before the ability actually does its effect (dealing damage dashing shooting projectiles etc). If Veigars R cast (NOT THE PROJECTILE FLYING) would be cancelled by lets say stealth it wouldnt go on cooldown because it only goes on cooldown if the cast successfully goes through.  A better comparasion would be KhaZixs Q this ability is exactly the same as Talons melee Q but since its coded properly it doesnt go on cooldown when cancelled.
hm9hwmu,keithstonee,11/27/2021,1,7.0,What is this advice?  Hey bait their CDs and you win duh. Like yea no shit.
hma6up0,Mucky_Rucky,11/27/2021,1,7.0,You have one of two options:  1.) Continue to snowball your lane go for solo kills or constantly shove down you opponent while minding the river for ganks. Doing this your lane will constantly be pushed in so you can to for objectives and make it back to your lane in time to catch the wave or miss a few cs since your opponent was pushed in so far.   2.) Lame it out and freeze your wave at your turret. This will cause your opponent to over extend past river if the want xp and gold setting up your jungler for easy ganks. Once that happens HARD shove that wave into turret and either recall or look for a TP play then start the process all over again.   But like the others have said it is very grey and it sounds like you need some more experience playing and learning the game and all the different scenarios on what gives you the highest probability of success since there are many right answers just choosing the best one for the situation.  But experiment out with the two above and learn to adapt from there.
hmbafkq,LezBeHonestHere_,11/27/2021,1,264.0,And lets also completely disregard the 6 auto attacks you need to do before you even get the 100 range. Its a nice effect if you live long enough to proc it lol.

hm9uucb,Umarill,11/27/2021,1,19.0,> all it takes is one or two towers to drop and they just instantly outscale you  Yes the 100 bonus gold they got from that will absolutely make them instantly outscale you compared to before that makes sense.
hmady2k,RedditChad420,11/27/2021,1,1.0,Quit crying dude
hm9jaux,Caenen_,11/27/2021,1,81.0,1. New issue with stealth indicators. To be actually seen the turrets true sight bubble needs LOS on you so the indicator is not actually correct even.  2. Related to the same thing. Stealth stuff got a bunch of weird changes this patch which Ill get to in detail a little later.  3. *Probably* also related to the stealth adjustments. Sudden impacts interaction with stealth might have been broken as a whole. Gonna investigate.  4. Not sure on this one will have to look into it first.  5. New with the stealth changes in 11.23 aswell happens to all camo champions. Seems to have more trigger conditions than just being out of cull range too.  6. I remember when this was introduced. The correct behaviour is for the W icon to be greyed out until the mark times out or is triggered then the cooldown starts. [Heres some more context on a post from a few months ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/oc6mpd/evelynn_w_cooldown_bug/) The bug was introduced at some time in the first half of Season 11.  Paging u/Riot_Koyuncu to see the extra context for the 6th bug.
hm8ylvp,TheSoupKitchen,11/27/2021,1,29.0,Unrelated to the post about Evelynn. But Kindred will randomly appear in your lane or literally ON YOUR SCREEN when she ends up showing cross-map for a gank. I was scared half to death because I knew a Kindred was botside but she flashed in my lane for a fraction of a second and upon looking at the minimap she was ganking bot and was nowhere near top.  I know this is also a bit of a legacy bug I remember it happening a lot with Nidalee in some season way back (which has since been fixed).  Only noticed it with Kindred. Also wish I had proof or more extensive evidence to showcase it.   (EDIT: FWIW this issue seemed to be in the previous patch and I havent played against Kindred to notice it still happening.)

hm8zwci,Syfix,11/27/2021,1,13.0,I hated them at first but am beginning to like it. It makes games where youre behind more bearable because you have a higher chance of a come back. Its frustrating when youre losing in league and you dont see any path to victory.  I used to dislike how it gave losing team free gold but its growing on me now. As the winning team I just make better trades and dont give the losing team any breathing room. I dont leave rift up on the map. I ward deep and counter rotate. I give up less free towers and objectives that I otherwise would have given if objective bounties werent a thing.
hmafpcy,firehydrant_man,11/27/2021,1,,she literally still needs to hit 6 autos to use it

hmb0190,SleepyLabrador,11/27/2021,1,7.0,> Make counter-picking less decisive   That would be very hard to do but all the top laners would agree with you. EVERY top laner has 3+ hard counters that make the game unplayable for you. Ill give some examples.  * I first pick a bruiser (Jax) The enemy team can pick Kennen Malphite or Poppy against me and I wont have fun.  * I first pick a tank(Malphite) The enemy team can pick Sylas Illaoi or Vladimir against me and I wont have fun.  * I first pick a juggernaut (Morde) The enemy team can pick Fiora Vayne or Trynd against me and I wont have fun.

hmaff5q,Twjohns96,11/27/2021,1,6.0,What role are you?  Game thinks you’re playing above where your rank actually is. You need to go on win streaks to change it.  I was getting 16 a win and losing 12-14- loss in gold and 20 something a win in silver.  I’m in plat now and I’m in the same situation as you with a 55% WR. But ever since I hit plat I havnt really gone on any winstreaks so until I play better the game isn’t going to let me climb. Truly just staying a float winning 1 losing 1 or losing 2- 3 in a row then winning a couple.  Currently reviewing my games seeing what I can do better to get climbing again. It’s called MMR. A lot of games have it. They implement it to keep the skill levels the same at certain ranks so people who are dominating don’t spend too much time with people who’s skill capped at that rank.  LoL is weird in that a plat player will absolutely 1v9 a bronze silver game especially if they are playing JG/ mid. So you really don’t want people too much higher or lower than your rank in your games cus they can absolutely ruin the game.
hm9jyns,Piegan,11/27/2021,1,21.0,I miss when we didnt have any of this automated timing garbage and early warning for camp spawns. If you wanted to time buffs or dragons you had to do it yourself and when I had to type 823ob 921er in chat it felt like my team paid a lot more attention to it VS auto timers that show up when you press tab. Being rewarded for keeping track of the 6 minute dragon timer and being there early while the other team forgot and showed up too late to contest it felt so good.  But they added timers for buffs dragon baron herald. You get enough warning on something spawning that you can run cross-map for it in most cases. Its a very slippery slope give it 5 more years and well have automated timers for practically everything.
hmajdoj,BahLo-,11/27/2021,1,375.0,Sure everyone handles it differently the thing is. Im saying i dont think it was that bad of a situation.

hm9p5g9,deediazh,11/27/2021,1,13.0,There is no wrong when both abilities are that good it comes down to preference of clear speed vs ganking power. Although people has settle for the best of both worlds 3 points into Q so it gives a nice early jungle clear and then W for good damage once you transform.

hm8vlds,ryantix,11/27/2021,1,20.0,Id argue that aram is too confusing for new players. The champion pool is from at least 65 champions which means new players are constantly having to figure out how to play new champions. In SR they can focus on learning one champion at a time and go into the game knowing what to expect.  Edit: I do think aram is a great place to learn once youve gotten a foothold in league though.
hma5ygo,RevolutionaryBricks,11/27/2021,1,55.0,Well sniper’s gonna have a rough time then- there was a point this season where his brother couldn’t get a visa so we know it’s about 80 ping to the inhouses from where they live.

hmar8mb,_imrahulyadav,11/27/2021,1,71.0,Is that character bad or unbalanced?
hmbdfq7,Keldricc,11/27/2021,1,,It already gives a 33% reduced damage output but the thing is you also take 40% less damage while revived by Chemtech soul so it’s also harder to die from getting hit.
hm8whv2,VfiMusic,11/27/2021,1,177.0,There is a setting that changes from closest to champion to closest to cursor it’s a checkbox somewhere in the settings
hmbmx2f,_gr1m,11/27/2021,1,7.0,Yes exactly. I used to dominate the early game and basically render enemy jungle useless since my playstyle is super aggressive and I tend to get red and then directly steal blue and frog. So Id say with confidence that probably 90% of the games I have won the early game for my team since theyre left to farm gank-free for at least the first 6 to 7 minutes. 10 if I manage to catch the jungle on the spot and I almost never lost first blood. And that changed for me too. Seems like most of the jungle options either had a base stat buff or something because I ALWAYS used to out damage the likes of Viego Diana Gragas and Yi.    Now Im like a minion compared to them in 1v1 with just jungle item

hmaern2,Hot_Professor_5360,11/27/2021,1,44.0,Sounds like this game isn’t for you - try Roblox. my 8 year old loves it.
hmae8do,Akait0,11/27/2021,1,376.0,Upset did say why he was leaving family emergency and explained the details to Yamato (and apparently the other coach as well)  DL says that he should have explained until the rest of his teammates felt that it was a justified reason. No he shouldnt. What constitutes a justified reason? Some people will never find justifiable leaving just before worlds no matter how bad the situation is. Others (like apparently Hyli) find justified his decision without having to further elaborate. Justifiable reason is not a measure because different people consider it vastly different and you cant appease everyone.   Im not denying that what Upset did screwed their teammates. But Adam taking it to social media just screams inmature child.  Sure Adam can be understandably mad (IMO big part of this is on the coaching staff that failed to answer the questions players had around Upsets departure and/or calm the tension between the players because if Upset is playing next year for FNC it means that they were ok with him leaving yet failed to convey that to the players) but what he should have done is reaching to Upset. If that didnt work then just shut up and move on. Hes not on that org anymore.  Instead he started to speculate about the reasons for leaving because like a spoiled child he couldnt get the answer so he throws a tantrum because fuck Upset.   And I want to clarify that Im not defending Upsets decision to leave. If he ever decides to disclose it maybe I agree or maybe I find it absolutely ridiculous. But what Adam did is definitely being a shitty teammate.  This just reminds me that the LoL professional community is full of kids. I remember I used to like Bwipo but when he went to that Podcast and basically flamed Nemesis it really left a bad taste. Then all the drama surrounding his gf during this worlds further proves the inmaturity. But then again Nemesis also started speculating about Upsets abscense talking about cover-ups and using it as an opportunity to shit on FNC.  Inmaturity all around.
hm9arca,StarEaterShaddai,11/27/2021,1,359.0,The fact that player accounts rather than singular games are separated by region and cant play together is a testament to LoL divisions incompetence at infrastructure. 10 years ago I could get it but now its embarassing. Look at Dota 2. While accounts are bound to regions for the sake of the Steam store currency rate and top Immortal ranking(challenger equivalent) you can still party up with anyone and just choose in which region you want the lobby to be even having a display of latency values for each player. I know it would be unfair to compare Valve to Riot in terms of available funding and work force but lets not pretend that Riot is actually a s all indie company. The Riot client and Riot accounts really gave me hope but I guess its too soon.
hmbnqsn,Nivelyx,11/27/2021,1,12.0,I see your point and i can agree to some extent. But if you compare the massive amount of anger around objective bounties compared to champion bounties i can only point to objective bounties being implemented more recently.   What you are saying is that the team that is behind is being rewarded for doing what is expected  / easy. Champion bounties is in my opinion doing the same thing to a larger extent but since it is individual it makes you feel helpless when some ADD downie idiot has a huge bounty on your team.  That helpless feeling you have when you see the enemy team collect objective bounties Paul is something you probably felt from champion bounties aswell maybe you are just so used to it nowadays since it has been in the game for ages?  You mentioned that a solution to champion bounties is suiciding to enemy support wow that sounds like a good/healthy aspect of the game that totally makes sense! maybe unhealthy solutions like that will be found for objective bounties aswell? my guess is that one of those will be to not take drakes if you notice you are winning a bit to hardto avoid triggering bounties.
hmahn5q,OkHospital,11/27/2021,1,2.0,ahh thats a good point! would be really annoying to see a last pick afk dodge.

hm8ysso,fartdiroperandus,11/27/2021,1,,I think its often underestimated how mechanically bad a lot of bronze/iron players really are.  I have a friend in a similar situation and I would spec his games and try to see if I could offer advice... he was an adc main in bronze 3 just absolutely failing every play he went for. I was kinda shocked because just watching his clicks and stuff was so painful.   People say that bronze players could just think or whatever. But maybe they cant. I legit dont think its possible to win with this guy on your team as your adc.

hm9haog,Jetzu,11/27/2021,1,173.0,> there is plenty of reason to believe he left for his significant other and zero (aside from his fake outrage) his leaving was actually family related.  His significant other is also his wife you know his family.
hmbmgxt,Nivelyx,11/27/2021,1,12.0,I dont see how you can play around champion bounties. If your adc has a 700g bounty sure you can run around trying to defend her and stop the idiot from dying but eventually she  will autopilot and lose it.
hm95xqr,Terozu,11/27/2021,1,98.0,He didnt say they werent interested in women he said it was mostly Vi hitting on Cait.  And it was.  Cait very clearly is pretty naive in the romance department and it shows.  Id say Vi had a thing for Cait and Cait was trying to figure out how to build her thing for Vi.
hmbk4ic,JamisonDouglas,11/27/2021,1,154.0,Im criticising riot they knew the soul was overtuned said as much in their video and done nothing about it (like tuning other souls up or chemtech down etc.)  No jab at you just making a light-hearted joke about riot. You dont need to be so defensive friend.

hm9r84d,SaulJoker,11/27/2021,1,11.0,What I’m saying is that why didn’t they download OBS and record the live game that way instead of with their phone.  What you said was that they should just use replay which is fine but they cannot access the replay of a game that isn’t finished can they?  Obviously they can just wait for the game to end and then share the replay but the point is that if you’re going to record DURING THE GAME it would have been better to use recording software than to record with the phone.

hm998g6,DuckWasTaken,11/27/2021,1,191.0,Everyone can become better at league but it requires consistent focused attempts to improve to actually see change. You need to literally study the game to get truly better. Your friend despite what he says is not likely trying in the right way. If all he does is play without getting better its because he isnt deliberate about the cycle of learning and improvement.

hm9g4l8,Asdowa,11/27/2021,1,7.0,Unfortunately existance of manaless champions makes mana on items feel extremely bad. Either we have the current state with lack of options or some energy base / recourseless champion wastes gold on mana when buying some stuff.
hma867g,Mostdakka,11/27/2021,1,7.0,If you cant win sidelane you have to win teamfighrs. You are already in losing situation so you have to understand is that at best you are aiming to trade your lane for your team. Try to push the wave and rotate but if you cant there really isnt anything else to do but to leave and force 5vs4.

hmacrqz,Fabiocean,11/27/2021,1,83.0,35/70 or 40/80 would make more sense imo its still way too good for aa heavy melees while 45% would probably be a bit too much for some adcs. What I would like to see is the range getting streamlined to 50 for all champs then buffing ranged AS accordingly so there still is an AS rune for ranged champs that isnt limited to the first 3 auto attacks.

hm9rkyb,Bluepanda800,11/27/2021,1,62.0,If we are fine with potentially game breaking abilities the ice map could have snow piles that when walked over give players a snowball in one of their summoner spell slots that lasts for ~30 seconds that lets players hit enemy champs then on recast fly over to them like in ARAM.  The piles could slowly generate up to 5 snowballs and it works like a first come first served basis where you take a snowball reducing the number in the pile so there are less there for other people to take.  The dragon itself could give increased tenacity/slow resist to the team that takes it and the soul could grant a spell shield like buying edge of night/banshees veil or something.

hm9633h,edgelordweeb_,11/27/2021,1,30.0,I dont think theyre getting Beishang/Weiwei/Wei but they should still be looking for a jungler regardless. Junjia Shad0w or Xiaohao are probably the most feasible options. All have buyouts but its 100% worth it to pay those buyouts to have a good competitive jungler. Xiaohao especially would be massive. Would mention SofM but I dont think hed fit TES well. Worst case scenario they have to just promote Naruto from their LDL team which has been rumored for a while now. Also the support will probably be Zhuo.
hmb9dc2,CarefulConsequence2,11/27/2021,1,8.0,The only champ that I know how to play a bit better than average against is Zed. I usually go against him in lane with Annie. What I do is I try to rush Zhonyas so when he presses R I can just Zhonyas and doesnt do any damage when it goes off. I also make sure to stay a distance because what Zed really wants to cause tons of damage to you is be close to you especially with his shadow.  You could also play champs that counter Zed. Vlad could be an option. Not only can you press your W to dodge his R when Zed goes all in but if you have Zhonyas too that could also be useful. For me as an Annie player its always been about sustaining against Zed till I become powerful enough to burst him with Tibbers. Good luck!

hm9xtla,LeThomsen,11/27/2021,1,,It is tough - I got 3 of them..  I did use to play I played LoL raid in WoW and HotS it took all my freetime lucky I have a husbond who also played. Neither of us have the time today - well he play D&D games on Fridays online with his friends.  Honestly I did play a bit when I got my first child - not proud of this but a part of me wanted to play way more than I could and in a brief moment I chose gaming over my kid and then I realized that I had to stop playing.. Got my priorities wrong there and it was a wakeup call! So I chose to stop the same day.  It was not easy to stop because I really did like gaming - I did not game on a high level at all (except for wow). But it was all about choices.   The people I know IRL are not in the gaming world and they have no clue what it is all about. They dont get it and I know I cant talk to them about it.. I do miss the nerdy friends online.

hm9q7dr,Dan5000,11/27/2021,1,62.0,i really like the ice dragon idea but i wonder how thatd change the map layout itself. you couldnt freeze over the rivers and make people have slippery controls while moving or something that lame that works for platformers haha      just creating terrain of ice that blocks paths would be a mountain dragon and so on.. basically everything i could think of already exists in some form of another dragon. there must be something cool you can do though. would have highly prefered that theme to the hextech or chemtech one.

hmag2g3,Exclarius,11/27/2021,1,,> Something happening to you does not absolve you of the consequences of YOUR actions to THEM  The mental gymnastics of the point youre trying to make are staggering. Youre spinning the situation of someone whos dealing with a family trauma into some weird case where he chose to go home for fun. Of course Fnatic did worse than they would have with Upset there but jfc he had a legitimate reason to not be there. If you think your esports time comes before your family youre free to do so but I dont think this would be the case for most people.  Adam can be mad about the situation all he wants but it is not a reason to spread rumors and send his legion to harass Upset.  > No.... just dont be a fucking dick to the people you already screwed over. Not hard.  How is he being a dick? He communicated all he needed to. He didnt just hop on a plane without any communication. To quote Upset:  > I shared the situation with Yamato [Fnatic head coach] and I intended to do the same with Hylissang  ... >  “[Hylissang] knew me well enough as a person and how much I care about competing that he did not even want to know anything and I know people like Yamato and Hyli are friends for life.”  (source: https://www.dexerto.com/league-of-legends/upset-slams-former-fnatic-teammate-adam-over-disgusting-worlds-2021-claims-1706633/)  He did explain himself to a teammate he trusted. Has Hylissang turned this into a shitstorm? No he hasnt. Adam has chosen to be an immature child about this and spin this into something that it did not need to be.

hm9vi5o,TuxSH,11/27/2021,1,36.0,Lethal Tempo is quite disgusting on Yasuo and Yone if the opponent cant reliably do something against it: their Q cooldowns go down to around 1.8s at level 1.  Stomped a few botlanes with LT Yasuo/Glacial Rakan yesterday.

hmb1z1f,CoogiMonster,11/27/2021,1,,Not OP but there most likely will be adjustments but expect them to be minor.  I believe they nerfed infernal soul because of damage output.  Also this drake is always going to be strong as any adjustments will either be to duration of zombie state or percent damage removed in this state (currently 33% less damage). At the core they’d never add a GA cooldown because they’ve already stated they want these too feel powerful compared to the others — which is just piss poor balancing IMO.
hm9kj5g,KiruKashi,11/27/2021,1,20.0,I only play ARAM.  You can already bond in the lobby when you set up a wombo combo together  I also feel that because of the fast pace a game goes by people become less toxic.  Losing an hour long game slowly is tilting.  Losing a 15-20 minute ARAM doesnt feel to bad.

hm9i4cw,L2Hiku,11/27/2021,1,81.0,Qiyana is unplayable too. How can there be a bug that makes it so her q literally does no damage when it hits something every other time. Unless they fixed it by now.   Also elementist lux portrait icon when she has a skin on like water or fire resets to her base skin portrait after she dies. This sucks cus its my favorite part of the skin. :/ But atleast its not gameplay effecting.

hm9hr0t,Psyr1x,11/27/2021,1,14.0,At the moment its somewhat unlikely to be Corina... the only thing that would give a suggestion to Corina is that the character is rich and seemingly from Zaun... which many take to imply a chem baron.   Corinas not the only Chem Baron we know just the most forward facing living one atm (rip Silco) due to LoR.  The words used to tease the support do not align with Corinas personality nor do they in any way appeal to the core themes Corina has:  I.e. being a self-made woman and a woman who innovates her own experiments and designs.   There are zero puns that reference plants and flowers which are the prime identifier for Corina... Itd be odd to tease a champ and not make any reference to their major gimmicks and identifiers.  All in all it paints it as somewhat unlikely atm to be Corina.

When he rolls a 9 he rolls over the enemy team & shows 0 mercy. But when he rolls a 3 it looks Swords cosplay from the game v iG.  You give him resources he wins you titles. You put him on weakside its going to be a mess.

He can not speak Chinese relies on Doinb to translate in game meanwhile every other Korean players like Viper and Tarzan are already able to call important plays in Chinese while playing. He even refuses to communicate with his teammates when his tension is down such childish and selfish behavior.
hma7k1j,Lulullaby_,11/27/2021,1,145.0,I have to agree with this. Just because hes playing ARAM doesnt mean hes having the time of his life. Distraction is good in rough situations and playing League is in fact what most people on this sub play to get away from IRL.

hmb6xgc,Arkaidan8,11/27/2021,1,,>Dude animation cancels are bugs and so are a ton of other mechanics.   Are seriously comparing animation cancels to that shit? Have you ever seen videos of Kayns staying in base and using global Ws to nuke people? Its literally the same principile and its just as gamebreaking since it works with hexflash. This is just redicolous.  Juggernauts arent supposed to fall off juggernauts are supposed to be durable and hard hitting but slow both in movements and in animations.  The other day i was playing Mundo 10 cs per minute and i was 100-0 both by Divine Sunder Akali and by a 3 items Kindred when i was full build.
hm8zays,Treyofzero,11/27/2021,1,131.0,Skarner teaches me constantly the futility of playing the game with tactics and teamwork when you are on the bottom of the champion roster instead of the top. You lose so much to high damage as a cc bot and not-true tank you cant build any items or play any strategies to secure a win. Its full on reliance on everyone else in the game to make up for and inversely not capitalize on your glaring insurmountable weaknesses the ultimate self sabotage when you so much as pick the champ. Im sure this isnt skarner unique though but boy it is a special type of torture playing him.

Its not like its at 95 and the other drakes are at 70 the difference is marginal at the 86-91 range. Its definitely strong than the other drakes Im not arguing that but its not the apocalypse end all be all. Statistically youre losing no matter what the soul is its just marginally more winning.

hma9aqw,Coolestdude123,11/27/2021,1,,I kind of agree with you.  I think it is pretty obvious from everything that Upsets wife was saying she was depressed. And then the day before worlds she probably called him crying or something and then he rushed him.  So he went home and to cheer her up he played some ARAM.  This fits with everything anyone has said on the issue and with the actions.  We know:  1 It was an issue going on for several weeks that got worse just before worlds (a sudden event)  2 It was to do with his wife - Yamato in the interview linked the two when talking about it he said how dedicated upset was for grinding after this marriage and how it was really tough for him at the time (why the fuck would you get married during the season rather than waiting till the offseasons I have no idea).   3 Upset wont say the reason because people will question if it is a legit reason and harass his wife.  4 Adam said his wife was feeling lonely which fits.  5 Fits with all the wife buff comments from bwipos gf that they later said was a coincidence (obviously it wasnt lol).

Its more dont put a music video in your very serious show without the main characters being the lead role in the scene.

I think if you are facing her as a support it might be best to bring guardian as a rune and build mr early. That could definitely help at least in the early game imo.
hmaqbfa,the_w6rst_,11/27/2021,1,40.0,My big issue with Chemtech is the fact that you can use summoner and ultimates. Late game if you win a fight against a team with Chemtech soul they can still flash on your carries and kill them no problem. It seems like theres not way to stop it and its auto loss.

But anyways:  1) LS has comments on how he regards Max Waldo as conflict-avoidant when put against strong personalities. 2) Observation from behaviour onstream over the years from when he still was LS house. Doesnt seem extroverted to me. Noted indications to him being averse like trailing off conflicts (e.g. Yeah...) or not being proactive/ knowing how to handle specific situations (LS anger moments being the thing that stand out). 3) Do you have any counter-evidence that point to him being extroverted or conflict-averse?

With that said i think objective bounties are healtheir than champion bounties because it allows for more scaling and i like mages haha... No but the thing that i like about objective bounties is that it decreases the importance of laning. You can make good plays on the map later in the game and secure some objective bounties.

hm9bj4y,WintersEnvoy,11/27/2021,1,9.0,This is such a huge misunderstanding of comparing the roles impact to raw difference in player skill. A support can impact other lanes yes (mostly midlane top roams are less common than once per game not very realistic or consistent). And they can absolutely turn lanes around especially if more than once (doomed for an evenly matched mid who gets 2 vs 0 roams)     On the whole turn it into a kill lane thats just pure skill diff through and through you cant pull that shit in elos where supports arent brain damaged turds. But yes any dia player can spam brand in gold and win a ton of games much more EASILY than offroling other roles they also dont know. It doesnt stem from supp impact just that its so easy to offrole it and also the chance to win a lane for 2 players very easily which was already my point support is easy to offrole thats the only reason its easy to climb especially lower elos where support skill levels are genuinely poor (compared to other roles).   &#x200B  But this doesnt mean a support has actual more impact than a top or mid does on their own lanes or than jungler does. Thats nonsensical. A support roaming 4 mAYBE 5 times in a game vs one who does 0 or 3 bad/pointless ones is basically a 5v4 game. If the enemy support is sitting bot because theyre yuumi or whatever or just passively playing an enchanter or velkoz who roams poorly for w/e reason (or into an enemy corki/liss mid or whatever) and theyre not near 100 % freezing enemy adc off exp then theyre missplaying your teams support is only hard carrying because the enemy support is brain damaged (or maybe the enemy adc obviously a support cant solo freeze if their adc shoves in).  Furthermore yeah if an adc knows a support who roams at wrong times and lets the enemy bot 2v1 your adc for more than 30 seconds at a time has to get shit done I couldnt tell you how many games you see supports abanadon incredibly easy 2v2 lanes so that the adc ends up dying once twice three times because 1v2 laning for more than a single wave is very difficult if your supports gone 2 minutes that better be minimum 1 kill probably not even worth just one depending on whats happening botlane. And in the cases supports are doing normal roams (like when youre supposed to shoved and recall or lane gank mid into going back bot etc) then supports dont even have remotely the same impact as jungle/mid/tops do because they only get those shots like 2-3 times per game for most games.  Support being a super strong role in soloq is a serious misconception stemming from like aftershock nonsense 2018 its a role that has been objectively very nerfed the last 3 years in everything from rune choices to champs to items. Supports look so strong because they dominate laning phase for botlane and also get to roam. But its an illusion for actual strength in soloq winning botlane doesnt impact games that much unless youre turbo 0/10ing them by end of laning phase. Ganking in laning phase \*can\* have huge impact on the overall game state but the vast majority of games it doesnt actually have that impact its just tit for tat generally playing for counterganking or punishing overcommited fights by playing from out of vision. Roaming 3 minutes flat during a game and achieving 2 assists is probably a failure (unless its like turned kills so you save one and kill one as opposed to just getting a free kill in an already won lane) because you shaft your adc so hard and without extended roam periods youre only looking at a miniscule amout of ganks throughout laning phases most of which will achieve nothing because its so easy to predict them at obvious recall points. Supports helping with invades is also super situational which requires winning botlane matchups on top of good wave situations vision info jgl and mid matchups.

hma2e28,TheFlattestStanley,11/27/2021,1,,The idea that ffing games is optimal so you can get another one to climb more is a misconception.  And like if whether or not you are enjoying the game is entirely based off of whether or not you are wasting time (losing) then this probably isnt the best game for you.  >If you had limited time to play too you wouldnt want to be stuck in a game with somebody flaming and wasting your time.   >Sometimes that 10 minutes is the difference between getting another game in and not being able too.  Ok and what if you were to lose that game as well? Desperately playing games in the hope that youll win one and start feeling better is not a good strategy for life.  You arent even losing out on any potential games that youve planned for. Lets say youve managed to set aside a hour and a half to play league (arbitrary amount of time just for an example). You can fit 2 games in that. If ffing one of those games lets you fit in a third and your team doesnt ff youre still playing 2 games which is what you expected to play that day if that makes sense.

hm9b7bz,Swing_Youth,11/27/2021,1,29.0,Its such an interesting blend of personal preference and practicality. At the very beginning it probably is best to try lots of champs out to find your favorite playstyle/position - but this will come at the cost of your chances to win or do well in games because you wont know the champion very well. So after that I think theres great merit in picking one or two champions to main (play the most and become expert on) because once you become proficient on a champion you will be able to focus on the other elements of the game outside of just controlling your character (and those external elements are what will elevate your gameplay the most).  Its actually very fun picking a main. They dont have to be a strong champion in the meta right now pick someone who you like the mechanics/vibe/lore/aesthetic of! Ive been playing League for yeeeears and play the same 3 champions in about 90% of games! The other ones dont inspire me in the same way.
hm9y4an,MrAssassin9891,11/27/2021,1,35.0,I believe those are from the super fan icons you could buy back in 2019. They only work in custom games / training tool (mine do at least).

hm9pbm5,Padouch1038,11/27/2021,1,55.0,Btw try Udyr with Prowlers Claw first item. It basically gives you a dash to insta stun your target in ganks. Tried it with Tiger Udyr and just spammed ganks on lanes without them to be able to do anything.  Either use it right away or run up with Bear and use it when they try to flee for another stun. Almost no counterplay.
hm9l1mz,JealotGaming,11/27/2021,1,40.0,Sylas and Jhins stories for sure.
hmb9lvx,Spitfire836,11/27/2021,1,264.0,Lethal tempo was 100% intended for use on ADCs since a lot of them can use it very well. Problem is that melee also gets the range increase (and ofc lots of attack speed is good on everyone).
hmapw2j,AdvancedPhoenix,11/27/2021,1,199.0,Yeah so infuriating all looks like good to top tier players and couldnt do shit.

Early guess HoB might be the best option with tempo in the dumpster. You still want those feathers on the field and theres ... not another AS option. It just sucks that the red runes ADCs like have been chain nerfed at this point.
hm9e10c,ElScrab,11/27/2021,1,372.0,No because of the ping. Unless they make the system like in Valorant where you can choose the servers you connect to.

hma1shw,TheFlattestStanley,11/27/2021,1,36.0,>not wasting tens of minutes  If you view playing a losing game as wasting time then you only care about winning and probably shouldnt play league.  Similarly if you dont want to spend time in games this long you should probably look for a different game to play.
hm9jyl7,AngryToeCheese,11/27/2021,1,196.0,1. Turn off all forms of chat. Theres little to nothing that cant be communicated through pings.  2. Play for objectives. Winning lane 5/0 doesnt mean jack shit if you have 1 dragon to their 4 and they get Shelly.  3. Dont KDA chase. If you hard win a teamfight and two assholes escape dont run them down through their jungle. Fucking do Baron god dammit.  4. Only play 3-4 champs at maximum in ranked. Only play off-role if filled and you dont want to dodge. Norms exist for a fucking reason.  5. Buy control wards and use them at objectives or to guard important resources. If you have 75+gold after your buy and you dont have a control ward youre inting.
hm9q7wn,talinhaga,11/27/2021,1,401.0,True. But seems like Joe Marsh is interested in Innovation based from his recent interview. Incoming Inno + Guma contents once he comes back from military and Guma stays for 2 more years.    Is there a player that youd like to meet again/have them play for T1 again?  Joe Marsh: I would love to have INnoVation Gumayusis brother come back a little bit more. We have BoxeR around the building it would be cool to see them interact.

hmap0do,bupropiom,11/27/2021,1,20.0,Considering I spent the majority of season 11 in D2 mmr that makes sense lmao. Aatrox is still frustrating because he is so skill based that people that know Aatrox spacing well enough give my lack of mobility some trouble as well as not having enough sustain damage for his healing.
hmbih0f,LightModeIsTheBest,11/27/2021,1,154.0,Why not make this current soul the elder dragon buff and have baron buff become progressively better as more are killed. I.E 1st elder is current chem soul 2nd elder is 15% max hp execute 3rd 20 and 4+ is 25%

hm9hi4l,THEDumbasscus,11/27/2021,1,4458.0,Remember game 4 of that exact series when Wunder got first blooded level 1 and then had to have jankos sit on his lane (not clear Krugs next to him but explicitly sit under his tower with him) for 3 consecutive waves causing Jankos to finally recall at level 4 as Bwipo was clearing the camp that would get him level 6? Because I do and it was so funny.  Upset was better than rekkles that day. Wunder’s consistent need to call for resources in order to not even win lane just continue existing in lane cost fnatic so much more than upset being a better right clicker than rekkles

hm9akjf,Raynar7,11/27/2021,1,6.0,Without the further context aka what started Zyra’s **that’s racist** it can be just you trying to get sympathy.  And without going deep into what terms are overused as heck….  People playing this game should be honest to each other. If everyone who writes something bad in chat would be banned nobody would play this game that’s just how it is. Game is not toxic people are. And having a competitive multiplayer game without any kind of toxicity is just utopia.

I had to quit my second job because of the pandemic but I also have physical problems. I get really really bad feet pain plus fast food is stressful. I think I just need a job where Im not standing all day and it would be a lot easier.

hmbfzbp,Rias-senpai,11/27/2021,1,303.0,Severum does not stack LT.  Kog is far weaker in lane because of the LT changes. Before it was possible to trade aggressively with pre-proccing LT and walking up with BaB + tempo. Now youre essentially fighting without a rune since Kog loses most extended trades without Lulu and hes never been good at burst trades pre 6.

Peanut is soooo hyper dependent on meta and mental. If neither of those are syncd that dude is a Sad Boy. Doran might not even make a top 10 Eastern top laner list. Id have to think about it. Lehends is solid. Wouldnt say hes like a top 5 support in the World.

hm9so2o,pseudolemons,11/27/2021,1,266.0,Playing jungle is like managing kids. You hear their shouting and struggling and it might even annoy you every now and then but at the end of the day youre so influential and powerful early compared to them it mostly doesnt bother you.  You also get to feel proud if your kids and be like  I made you when they get fed late.  If anything I think junglers are just toxic parents.

hmafimh,Tilterino247,11/27/2021,1,215.0,Oh. So you just ignored that your original comment was dumb and that you completely misunderstood what you replied to?   Doublelift will win you LCS and take you to worlds. But he did bad at worlds!!   1. That doesnt have anything to do with what I said.  2. So did bjerg and its not looking to be a problem for him.   If you dont like him thats fine a lot of people do t for some reason.  But youre full on blind deaf and dumb if you cant see that hes the best player to ever play in NA so far. If he is playing in LCS hes in the finals. If hes in the finals he wins.   If a team not named 100t tl or tsm (tsm only there cause of ab urged Bridge their adc is not comparable to lift) wanted to win theyd have lift on their team.

hm9deo2,Atheist-Gods,11/27/2021,1,215.0,Ive documented some Seraphine bugs but was unaware whether they were on Riots radar:  1) Q will sometimes pass through targets without damaging them when they are walking towards the center. This is not just the standard weird hitboxes and even happens against targets in the exact middle of a fairly large AoE. I assume that its due to a bug with the hit detection on the wave where a target can walk from outside the expanding circle to inside without being seen as a hit  2) Her echo passive can sometimes be canceled without going off likely due to inputting another action at the exact right time. It tends to happen when I am spamming a followup attack or spell.  These both occur fairly regularly. I would estimate that I notice the first happening 2-3 times per game and the 2nd every other game.   Clip of Q bug: https://streamable.com/s6sf67   The first Q does 0 damage to the left melee minion and front ranged minion both of whom are within the hitbox as shown by how the right ranged minion is even further away on the 2nd Q but still gets hit.

hmbgq70,Schlectify,11/27/2021,1,5.0,While they may have not built any of the new items there are also new runes and tweaks to old items that have seriously changed how a lot of things work. I dont know of any direct nerfs to shaco but with new itemization its going to take a bit of reworking how you approach different champs and situations. Sadly i dont know enough about shaco to give you any more info.

hm9f9c7,Mixed_not_swirled,11/27/2021,1,372.0,I feel bad for you. As a gamer in Siberia you will never have good or even decent ping because of the vast landscape being so sparsely populated. There wont be a server there and any server will be far away or in Chinese/Korean.

No one flamed the veigar and he just kept trying to play the game and ended up like 18/15. I feel like hard flaming would’ve caused him to play way worse than he did or maybe he would’ve afk’d

Adam is immature enough to violate any semblance of trust and air out every little detail of the situation on Twitter despite not even knowing the real reason. We know damn well that if given the true reason it would’ve ended up in his post completely violating Upset’s privacy when it is absolutely not Adam’s business to post such private information.  Basically Adam behaved like a child which he is. Hyli behaved like an adult and professional. Adam openly invited people to harass Upset and his wife with a lengthy public post with incomplete information. I am outwardly calling Adam unprofessional because his actions were unprofessional. No flame towards his personal relations but in the workplace he objectively behaved unprofessionally.

hmbctz4,toxicityisamyth,11/27/2021,1,38.0,From ur first sentence it sounds like you aint even watch the scene. Maybe you should do that before replying.  2nd i am not talking about football or basketball or american football coaches abd players im talking about league of legends coaches and players. Huge distinction. I would most definitely not consider behaviour patterns from both sports and lolesports worlds the same. ^^
hm9u8s5,Definitelyurmomscat,11/27/2021,1,44.0,I would love to see Lux’s reaction to Sylas using her magic to escape demacia I feel like an entire demacia season or plot line at least could have a lot of potential

hmbihrt,Vrathal,11/27/2021,1,1528.0,Its likely a bit of both in the game he only heals off a percentage of the damage done but not the full damage.  The CGI video seemed to follow that since he was hurt but didnt appear to be hurt as badly as he was prior to the reverse.
hmbhyj7,Account40,11/27/2021,1,52.0,I dont really know if that applies though. Its not like people are really trying to say could of the same way you want to say yall or gonna. Thats like saying  intensive purposes is a colloquial form of intents and purposes
hm9spv8,JohnGaltMorreuBabaca,11/27/2021,1,62.0,But hey rioters commented on a bug thread! Theyre are so inclusive arent they? What a nice company that cares about us.    Lets see how many interact now.    Either way its summer.

hmamv5y,xantolu,11/27/2021,1,140.0,I agree on yasuo im not sure about udyr and yi but its far from OP on trynda.  He takes way too long to stack it the old lethal was better for him in a lot of cases.   And that applies even more since other toplaners take lethal aswell and stack it faster than him (notably tops with AA resets or AS steroids).  Jax Sett WW Yone Xin and Trundle would be better examples.

hmbae5j,tanezuki,11/27/2021,1,91.0,>Fair enough although tbh i expected runnan to not apply it since abilities like Ezreal Q or GP Q dont count towards the 3 autos necessary.  Runaan has some specific rules like for Vaynes on hit not being able to be triggered by it while Runaan do apply on hit effects.   About the concern I doubt the enemy ADC will try to attack your ADC when youre between the twos as a Darius or a Nasus. This just focus the adc sounds more like a meme to me than anything else when adressed to adcs.
hm9e1qy,Talonoscopy,11/27/2021,1,219.0,He just wants zero counterplay to ADCs nothing should work against them. Not CC not burst not outranging spells nothing.
hm9b0if,magnetar2,11/27/2021,1,12.0,So how are we supposed to abolish discrimination against people if we allow people to be toxic just because  that’s just how it is? Let me guess maybe we arent supposed to abolish (racial) discrimination at all because  that’s just how it is? Let me know.
hm9aw5n,ParagonEsquire,11/27/2021,1,27.0,Man having not played in a while but being a big Miss Fortune fan I was going to hop into that RK game but this topic made me do research and how badly they shaft her and how meaningless that makes the game’s story I’m not sure I’ll bother now. =|  Like I don’t know what I hate more that they turned her full evil or that they killed her off that simply (not that she’ll actually die because some other reason to sell skins will arrive).

Itd be super unlikely that eve level 2 ganks us. Ahh okay so were going to try E dash trade early game here with pta... 1... 2... 3 E dash... Oh we still lost that?
hm9jz96,WintersEnvoy,11/27/2021,1,6.0,Theres no reason to ever stream league as a beginner streamer unless youre grandmaster+. Its just too bloated a category. Youre most certainly not funny enough even if you were you would still likely be obscure without some youtube fame/videos.

hm9h8l1,YUNG_GOD_X,11/27/2021,1,585.0,People will have different mindsets about it. In my opinion Id put in the time as soon as you are confident in your ability to perform consistently. If you dont think youre ready to play ranked hold off. But the sooner you start the sooner you eliminate ranked anxiety. Good luck man and welcome to the game!
hma7l6s,unguibus_et_rostro,11/27/2021,1,145.0,Why does everyone keep on assuming it has to be very serious to leave worlds when we literally had a player leak team strats and match fix at worlds for a girl?

If my teammates want to vote to lose a game every time they feel like they are behind that is entirely their decision. They are just going to have to wait until 20 mins to do that because Im not voting yes.  >100% losing game   No such thing.  > you just realize its selfish  Its equally as selfish to vote for someone else to lose LP just because you arent enjoying yourself

hm9l5zg,notaboxlor,11/27/2021,1,2.0,I agree that resistances are pointless. Ive been a tank many times going full armour against all AD teams and they get one pen item and youre useless.   Lord doms is broken against tanks as most tank items give defence and health so you basically get punished for it.   Also items in general have too many stats and bonus effects like percentage health damage shields slows etc.   Main problem for me is when they changed everything to %s.

hmb7hfo,markson852,11/27/2021,1,,I never tried to portray him like some victims being sent off to pick cotton?? I was just trying to say he has always been the type of player that did not communicate and if this type of player is actually a no for them then they made a bad hire.
hma0530,tanezuki,11/27/2021,1,70.0,Well tbh its one of the hardest GW condition to inflinct when you think about it. Id rather have the 50% HP threshold like the others.
hm8z9gl,dannyboyheinz,11/27/2021,1,13.0,Because lane doesnt always work that way. Ideally I have it but sometimes I get ganked and cant set my wave up to walk back.
hm9fm7q,Hazel-Ice,11/27/2021,1,33.0,> If people were complaining about accuracy in norms then theyve forgotten that League is a game that should be enjoyed and isnt just about winning  This seems to imply that you think people should just enjoy the winter map instead of complaining about it.
hmbied1,random_stoner,11/27/2021,1,57.0,Its a term from back in the day like season 2 or earlier where aram wasnt an official game mode yet. People back In the day would create custom games called ARAM played on summoners rift and you kinda had to hope that everyone played by the unofficial rules which today are normal aram rules. Like no buying or healing until dead random champion etc.

hm9a0l1,Xyrazk,11/27/2021,1,191.0,What role does he main? I have a hardstuck Bronze friend who reminds me of how you describe your friend. What Ive gathered from watching him play is that he autopilots when playing support which is why he keeps playing the role.  He wants to reach gold so he can get Victorious Skin but doesnt want to have to think when he plays. He just sees what his ADC is doing and mirrors it. Also he doesnt understand win conditions and when he loses he just blames broken champs and op items.
hm9ql81,ENVYX0,11/27/2021,1,17.0,Dosent matter if ur 2/3 if ur not using any of the value from the 1500 gold lol plus overextended seems more like you inted even though I think kayns Op this isnt an instance of it

hm9qt8p,TheWalrius,11/27/2021,1,26.0,If they game is truly lost and undeniably so youll still get the 4 votes required to ff.  You however wont succeed on the early vote because 20% of your team doesnt agree that the game is entirely lost at 15 minutes.  Grow up if you cant fathom sitting in a game for 5 more minutes because your temper tantrum ff@15 failed. So tired of reading articles from people who spend 1000 hours on a game and then cry about time wasted when they cant give up immediately.  Im glad your clairvoyance allows you to see the outcome of a game before it actually ends. Please be patient with those of us that lack your clearly divine foresight.  /rant
hm9byis,musashihokusai,11/27/2021,1,157.0,Make a rune new rune page every game. You’ll never “lol chose wrong page” or get into “whoops forgot to change X for matchup” situations.
hm96p1v,Trinitati,11/27/2021,1,42.0,It does. The reason why it appears otherwise is because the ability that drops aggro also does damage ***after*** the untargetability ends (e.g. Fizz E Yi Q etc)  e.g. if you dont autoattack after Camille R (which doesnt do damage on its own) the tower should just go back to minion targetting.

hmamvwo,trapsinplace,11/27/2021,1,40.0,Not sure if it does this already but itd be better if cooldowns were frozen while dead and then kept ticking after you came back. I am fairly certain your CDs keep ticking while youre reviving and so by the time you are back up most of your CDs are ready to go.  This is utterly broken for the champs I play which tend to be CC-heavy tanks or supports.
hm9vh5e,nyasiaa,11/27/2021,1,103.0,the 4 is like idk I remember they did some changes to that in the past back when elise was super popular in the pro play to make tower diving harder but I dont remember what the changes were exactly
hm8w47r,Initium__novum,11/27/2021,1,322.0,As an LGBT+ person from EE with a trans girlfriend i feel amused agreeing with you. Its definitely a cesspit of homophobia and sexism although some countries are worse than others and the worst countries arent present on the server (Russia Ukraine).
hmapq6f,Pampss,11/27/2021,1,392.0,Based on what? If what Adam said was even close to the truth of it do you honestly believe Upset would not only be on the team next year but being consulted on who he wants to play with. FNC is a major organization with tens of millions of dollars being funneled in from fans investments and sponsorships every single year. If Upset had single-handedly ended FNCc world hopes without a valid reason Sam Mathews and the rest of the FNC ownership would be obligated to release Upset whether they wanted to or not.  The fact that the organization and Upset still have a working relationship is proof on its own that whatever reason Upset had to leave was a valid one. Forbes listed the organizations worth at 120 million Dollars. People still have these crazy notions that league teams are five friends playing for some mousemats. Businesses that deal in that amount of capital are held to far higher standards and expectations than anyone on this Subreddit gives them credit for why do you think Ocelotte has to explode his whole roster despite the players still clearly being very good.

I dont understand your purpose for commenting.  If youre admitting it is a problem then why are you saying otherwise. Youre saying I agree but only under x circumstances then its ok to give up just dont give up.
hma5834,Zerole00,11/27/2021,1,147.0,Whats hilarious here is DL is parroting the same stupid shit redditors have been:  >Youre gonna have to tell them why...Even if you give them a very vague answer...  He literally did so with urgent family matter which Adam even said in his TL - that just wasnt sufficient for Adam (or the redditors itching for drama). There are some subjects where theres really not much room for being vague (my personal guess is that his wife had a miscarriage).  A lot of people here also seem to miss the nuance that both sides can be correct in feeling the way they do. If my coworker had to bail on a big project because of a death in the family thats perfectly understandable but I can still be pissed because the delay cost me a $20k bonus and I had done nothing wrong other than being at the wrong place at the wrong time.

Level 200+ appear in your game cause they arr so bad after playing so much or playing with smurfs on their alts that are your level
hmbkgcx,donglover2020,11/27/2021,1,88.0,I disagree actually. Sylas could be argued as the main character for Demacia but i feel like Lux fills that role A LOT better. Shes perfectly divided between both sides of the conflict and her actions would resolve the plotline. But regardless neither of them have a global influence theyre confined to Demacia (and Sylas had a small trip to Freljord but didnt do anything major before coming back)
hm9nkbv,supterfuge,11/27/2021,1,171.0,But hey teams are still going to pretend like franchising will help them in the long run by ... ah yes selling every good player they can to make money without giving a fuck about winning the league. Great.
hmabzt9,xKayko,11/27/2021,1,311.0,there is a reason fnatic wanted to replace adam lets be real cmon
hmb8hg8,EgonThyPickle,11/27/2021,1,47.0,> and Lyandries makes you wonder why you even bother buying MR in the first place.  MR is really good to build against Liandrys though? Liandrys is an anti-health item its not an anti-MR item. Saying that Liandrys makes you wonder why you bother buying MR is like saying BotRK makes you wonder why you bother buying armor. Both of these statements make absolutely no sense.

hmbirq9,KingFredo5674,11/27/2021,1,88.0,Old Jax lore was better and funnier imo. They literally had to nerf him and give him a lamppost to fight other champions because he was too broken with other real weapons.  Imagine if I had a real weapon I hope they never remove this line....
hmaeokh,zammouri2001,11/27/2021,1,58.0,People will give you easy champions to learn but tbh Id say play whatever you want. Pick a champion you find cool you probably could get decent with them in less than 20 games and get to focus on other things and have plenty of fun. Dont think people will be nice to you once you get better the flame never ends!
hmay2cl,Spartan05089234,11/27/2021,1,65.0,Chemtech is insanely strong and the only way to balance it will be with anti fun BS like a long internal cooldown or one use only or something. I dont k ow how it can stay in its present form but also be balanced and engaging.
hmalkxx,sarahbotts,11/27/2021,1,6.0,You’re good to go.
hm9kq8q,LeThomsen,11/27/2021,1,16.0,Its all about balance and fun. If neither is t here then it might be the time to quit but if you can manage it all then go for it keep playing!  Im to old to play now and I have kids to so there is no time - not until they are old enough to play LoL them self then we all play - if LoL exists at the time.  Why not find similar gamers in here to play with?   Sorry for my poor english but I think you understand the meaning :)
hm9mt5w,xanat9,11/27/2021,1,17.0,Apparently nobody is mentioning Ziggs but he has by far the best turret damage in the game from early to late.  If you wanna max it you can level up W before E but in general if you are winning lane youll 100% get the first turret
hm998yw,CrystalBeard626,11/27/2021,1,8.0,Its bad design that is antithetical to what we know of the character. Hell Vis original design has very little in common with what we now know of her.

hmblslu,Lvl100Karp,11/27/2021,1,,Adam is immature enough to violate any semblance of trust  Why should he have any respect for someone who refuses to trust him with information and tries to replace him behind his back?  We know damn well that if given the true reason it would’ve ended up in his post   We dont.  Hyli was given the chance to get to know the truth Adam didnt. How would that make you feel when youre 5 humans in the team?  If anyone behaved unprofessionally its Upset choosing certain coworkers to know the truth and leave others in the dark.

And I dont play assasins. But its pretty telling that all the broken assasins of last season werent actually building assassin items.   It was goredrinker and conqueror.

I have 10k BS and I almost never get oops all russians games unless I party up with people with bad BS and even if I do get them(solo) they still communicate just not in fluent english. The only difference between EUNE and EUW in terms of communication is that in EUW the non-communicating guy will speak french or spanish instead of polish or greek. In terms of skill below masters its always a coinflip as youll get carried-by-champ wannabe solo carries mute magnets and other toxic or clueless players on all servers. If a player is just fundamentally bad theyll just drop in rank.

hm9d8ee,BasicUsername_1,11/27/2021,1,15.0,Old mundo while basic was so much more fun because he felt so much more responsive and less slow and clunky (imo) new mundo feels like so much less of a carry and he’s not even a jungler anymore which is where I played him most. I had 70k points on old mundo in like a month or 2 after the rework I played one game and haven’t since.   Depends on your playstyle ig I feel if you liked old mundo you are less likely to like new mundo than someone who didn’t like old mundo just because the champ feels so much different aside thematically

hmanr75,Nameless_One_99,11/27/2021,1,98.0,Nuguri is a shy introvert who was bullied a lot plus he has had a lot of health issues related to being underweight for example his lung collapse was in big part because he was so skinny.             FPX either knew all of this before hiring him or they were inept with their research. And despite all this they never made a big effort to integrate Nuguri into the team and the culture.       Only Tian who isnt part of management made an effort to try and help Nuguri.             Now Nuguri made mistakes too but this is mostly on FPXs management just look at how EDG made such a big effort with Viper who also has the advantage of being an extrovert and a happy-go-lucky kind of guy.
hm9gebc,Slowest_Speed6,11/27/2021,1,48.0,Well you wont bave to worry about it much longer lol
hm99qz5,CreativeAd481,11/27/2021,1,6.0,Yes obviously hate speech is awful and should never be in the game.
hma9kl6,Matosque,11/27/2021,1,,who knows it then? give me one source?
hmb7ubk,Glum_Radio,11/27/2021,1,,Pick a realistic reason to argue with me.  Viper is just a gift child that learning fast with anything he is also extrovert person so it’s nonsense to compare him with Nuguri.  Gimgoon and Khan played in Lpl over 3 years before joining FPX so what’s your point to compare 3 of them with Nuguri????
hma2ojn,hpl2000,11/27/2021,1,,I mean I guess. It just sounds harsh to assume that everyone is playing the game “wrong” just because they aren’t in the top 0.01% of the playerbase. There’s no wrong way to play a video game as long as you enjoy yourself.
hmajmzm,homer12346,11/27/2021,1,23.0,it already does that
hmb72sa,loboleo94,11/27/2021,1,126.0,It’s actually the only dragon effect that doesn’t help at all one specific build (tanks).  Some may benefit more than others regarding all the remaining dragon buffs but if you are the beefiest player in the match you will get zero benefits from chemtech one.
hmacv7w,Ven0m37,11/27/2021,1,14.0,its more like LDR is too necessary. Without it you dont really deal enough damage. Imagine if that gets  nerfed too and then tanks start dominating again
hmbpcqb,plushrump,11/27/2021,1,170.0,Even at worlds you have games where one team gets dragon souls but the other team manages to come back and win the game. Feels like this is nigh impossible to do vs Chemtech because even if you win a fight the zombies will manage to get a few kills in return and you wont have anyone left to push towers with.    Had a game where enemy got Chemtech soul today. We swung gold on them twice with some good fights but couldnt end out the game since its so incredibly hard to do vs Chemtech soul.    Kill their squishy? Well they just revived and you gotta kill them again or let them do damage for free as their HP ticks down (nvm they have lifesteal lol). Kill a tank? Where here he is again to CC you to death.    Its just not fun to play against at all. All the old souls gave enemies a considerable buff (sans cloud) but they werent horrible to play against. Enemy does more damage/regens in fight/has a shield/is faster after ult is all  you could deal with. Literally being revived for a few seconds after death is not. All kills you get have to be picks and you have to back off right after. You will always lose a straight up teamfight vs Chemtech since youre effectively fighting 10 people.
hma8y9a,rueckhand,11/27/2021,1,,Rly he takes his mind off his problems by playin Arams with her??? Scum human wow deserves all the hate he gets from the French community
hm9mdmu,Le_Faveau,11/27/2021,1,21.0,Itd just be a matter of tuning the numbers to see if they compensate with damage to objectives / champion damage but if their participation is clearly minimal or non existent Riot could detect it and remove the right. to vote.  About that they could also punish AFK Farmers like that. afk farmers are trolls who just farm the jungle the entire game and recall to avoid fights so you lose 4 vs 5 Riot said itd be hard to detect but if a player isnt participating on damaging either champions or turrets / dragons / rift.. then hes clearly leaving his team to lose.
hm9e5sd,Randomd0g,11/27/2021,1,71.0,Yea if he fucks it up he just time travels to fix it
hmai4p2,Kindly-Committee5823,11/27/2021,1,18.0,ok thanks for your feedback. I will say though that I have seen some pros play vex well and they know how to turn the tide of a fight. but I will not say that support is the main role of vex.

hm8yux6,Zlera-Kilc-odi,11/27/2021,1,199.0,Honestly I think Riot just wants Rengar players to stop playing. The new Chemtech soul completely removes bushes that arent in the river && overall the invisibility zone just works like normal fog of war (aside from warding.)

hmaq1rx,ralanr,11/27/2021,1,40.0,I can’t say I like the chem dragon at all. It’s passive just straight up hurts every tanky champion on your team so you really need to get it even if it’s not a huge difference from your enemy. Then the soul is absolute bonkers.
hma3t97,hiccup333,11/27/2021,1,12388.0,Exactly.  You have to deliver in a satisfying way each segment of a story in this case season 1.  Like you can still have cliffhanger endings in a story but the story still delivers.  Like Avengers Infinity War comes to mind.   But here I felt shortchanged  You risk viewers not wanting to follow along with you to the next season because youve lost their trust in a way.  The tv show LOST is a famous example of it

hmae17t,LunaLance_,11/27/2021,1,407.0,I kinda feel this.  Jinx is depicted to have some LONG freaking hair but man those wigs have to be insanely heavy and a headache to figure out.  Then again when they first made jinx they may not have expected her to do as well as she did especially not grow to be a popular cosplay.  She began as a fun imagination in someones head and now its become this.  Absolutely insane and admirable.

hmba11e,Schlectify,11/27/2021,1,9.0,Seeing as none of the leaders of noxus have mustaches i would say they definitely arent mustache twirlers. But beside that point i definitely see them as more of the morally gray area than straight up bad guys. Demacia has slowly become one of my most hated places in runeterra because of the prejudice towards mages.
hmam931,SP3EDI,11/27/2021,1,392.0,Thats maybe so in murica but in europe or at least in Germany you are entitled to your privacy. Its even regulated by strict laws. We dont have such a sensational Drama media over hear like you guys have in murica. Dunno where you got that upset didnt want to play with adam before worlds. Upset was asked after worlds from alphari and fnatic management if he wants to play with alphari or adam. He chose alphari so would everyone else that has the choice. especially if you have the humanoid/perkz in mid too.  Iam on with you about that it is highly unlikely that fnatic would have won worlds. Nisqy and Adam showed that they are not up to par to win the competition. You would have maybe got more wins or got out of groups. But Bean showed up pretty good as sub and Adam and Nisqy still played horrible bad. They just want to scapegoat it to upset. Was it a mental shock to play with a sub ? sure. But there are other teams that have to play with subs from rival teams because of visa issues and they still give 100% to show up at worlds and dont just tilt and int it away to scapegoat others for bad performance later.
hm9lsc3,ICantTakeItNoMoreAAH,11/27/2021,1,10.0,Would make more sense if they scaled with total mana  Tear items always annoy me the stuff you often build out of them just gets removed from the finished item so you end up with a mediocre amount of what the item is supposed to be giving you in droves the Kindlegem you put in Archangle goes away when you build it much like how the old one gave you a depressing amount of AP from the item I generally just dont see the point in buying these items when they function like this
hmb4zu9,Glum_Radio,11/27/2021,1,147.0,So why are you replying me? My point from the beginning is about the FLUENTLY because they talk about Viper Viper = fluently. So they can’t compare Nuguri to Viper while they has different personality and ability. I’m talking about Viper and Nuguri im not talking about other.
hmb4y2b,ApplePitou,11/27/2021,1,3.0,Still a lot depends on what people you have in the team because there are people who even in preseason are very serious about Rankeds :3  Additionally if you decide to play have a nice games :3
hmb2sbc,Igelit,11/27/2021,1,91.0,Yup. That was the last itteration before they removed the revive completely.
hmbhw77,iWillBeAnAwesomePA,11/27/2021,1,111.0,Teams should start building it into their contracts Or just enforcing their players to play more inhouses and what not. Yeah its more practice more effort. Thats what youre being paid for. Rather than sit in Solo Q timers and complain about dumb shit or just not play Solo Q at all.
hm8ya9e,Kripox,11/27/2021,1,328.0,Russia is way too large for one server anyway. Even if you put it in Moscow that wouldnt do much good for Vladivostok 6.4k kilometers away.
hma2kqb,Spitfire836,11/27/2021,1,186.0,No job security but you’re guaranteed that contract money. At the very least you make bank especially if they send you to LCS where you make even more.
hm91gf0,SaltInANutshell,11/27/2021,1,196.0,Support players playing top is legit a free win because they are legit so bad that u can snowball out of control and 1v9. Its so funny how impactful top looks when u have that much of a lead lol.
hma4xg8,WintersEnvoy,11/27/2021,1,13.0,League toxicity is a meme it was spammed by anti league (e.g a lot of disgrunted dota players at the time) and the league community was young in the early days like 13-15 of age for the large part     Now league players are probably above 20 on average and despite reddit sentiment trolling and afking is quite rare. Most certainly more rare than peak overwatch where people would swap to a bad character as soon they lost a point. (maybe with their role queue its better now) Im not even sure where you get this community is trying to scare away new players from did you see like 2 reddit posts that were negative compared to the 3 dozen posts telling everyone to be super friendly to these new players since Arcane came out? Maybe the toxicity was the negativity inside us all along.
hmavad5,pseudolemons,11/27/2021,1,170.0,Funny you think balance is done reactively to winrates
hmaa48j,xGlaedr,11/27/2021,1,311.0,>but if he can choose to tell hyli and choose not to tell the rest of the team   >   >something is wrong somewhere  Trusting someone youve known for years vs trusting someone youve known for less than 6 months. Theres a fucking huge difference and the fact that you cant see that is wild.
hm9ftsp,GunnerPup13,11/27/2021,1,17.0,I had to quit after a while because as a new player the community was just way too toxic. I was brand new to the game trying to learn and people called me a garbage mid because I can’t be in two places at once. If top needed help I’d go over there and assist then bottom would immediately call me trash. Try to help bottom and they’d get mad because I was helping too much. I just couldn’t find a middle ground that worked. All I wanted to do was enjoy a game with my girlfriend at the time. Couldn’t even enjoy a brand new game.   I’ll be the first to tell you I suck at the game but I found my happy place as a mid. I would mostly run Shivana and loved the artwork and creativity of the characters and the game itself. It had beautiful characters and ideas. The community was just toxic AF. It reminded me a lot of the old Call of Duty days on the X box 360. It took a minute to find a lobby that wasn’t toxic but once you did you were with these guys the whole time. I can remember joking around and having fun back then. It could get toxic but some of us would shut that shit down quick. League was a new level of crazy.
hmba0gr,WoorieKod,11/27/2021,1,,So he can have wow didnt know youre here repliers

hm995t5,Terozu,11/27/2021,1,103.0,Dude.  Do you have romantic feelings for everyone you think about in the shower? Like no offense but shower doesnt mean anything.  And Vi says youre hot cupcake gets excited when Cait seems to be more interested in the chick than a guy among several other things.  Caitlyn was much less straight up attracted to Vi.  But she *was* getting there.  As I said before well probably get this expanded in season 2.  Edit  Actually no we got a sex scene between Jayce and a new character in season one.  We damn well better get this expanded in season 2.

hm9fxoz,Prestonwww,11/27/2021,1,17.0,Lol thats just how I like to write anything in general. I like in-depth conversations. Its genuinely fun for me to talk about anything really in this way albeit not quite as long but Ive had these thoughts and feelings about League for a long long time.

hmbkmkl,LoLrovex,11/27/2021,1,,Thank you.      Aphelios in soloq is terrible. You need a team that will draft around you and a support that can lane well. Although hes great in comp its just asking for too much to do it solo. Ezreal I found was the best ad in soloq as it was the least team reliant champion.

hm9fbqr,mogadichu,11/27/2021,1,11.0,You need to ask yourself two questions:  - What are your ambitions in life?   - Is League holding you back from achieving those ambitions?  Once you answer those questions youll know if you should quit or not.
hmb80qr,TeeTheSame,11/27/2021,1,264.0,You stack it on the enemy frontline engaging your teammates. When its stacked it gives so much more access to the enemy priority targets helps to keep distance to melees and getting mages and other adc in range without putting yourself in danger. Ofc you still have to position correctly. Its not a braindead auto win but a massive advantage if used correctly. You will see it in pro play if it doesnt get changed until then.

hm9kgfc,Parking-Pay-7429,11/27/2021,1,47.0,League is a global game not an american game. In places like korea and australia it is summer not winter so although the change will fit whoever is in america it will be weird for those in other countries

hmantkc,Trenton2001,11/27/2021,1,144.0,I know this is a late response but MF and Ahri have such a direct relation to the story that them being PC choices makes 0 sense. MF rules bilgewater part of that means protecting her and her people from the giant shadow isle danger RIGHT next to. Ahri and Yasuo headed to bilgewater together (which was teased in the cinematic where yone and yasuo fight) Yasuo to escape his past Ahri to find her past. Ahris ancestors had visited the blessed isles before they became the shadow isles. Illoais goddess hates the shadow isles.  Her god is all about destiny and change the shadow isles never change and its like a place in the world thats paused. Pyke and Braum are the only two oddities that feel like their story for being part of it was kind of random but both are still well written and great choices.  Btw this is ALL spoiler free everything I listed here is information available before the game came out (except for pyke and braums reasons which is why I didnt mention what they were) and even before the ruination event.

hmbk72x,Full_Ad9666,11/27/2021,1,81.0,So here’s an explanation for those who are wondering. It’s made in an app called Wombo Dream. There are several preset themes to choose from (Piltover and Zaun for example I used the steampunk theme) then I used the region names as the keyword to generate the pictures. I had to cheat on Freljord and Shurima because weren’t rendering anything close to those so I added the words snow and desert to the region names. Sorry I forgot about The Void Bandle City and Ixtal.

hm9o7oe,noahkillis,11/27/2021,1,10.0,maybe as a later part in arcane Ixtals war against Piltover (due to piltovers founders taking Ixtals territory to make Piltover)   Qiyana even has some spicy lines against Caitlyn + Vi in-game so that would be cool ig.

hmahlfm,DifferentHorse,11/27/2021,1,26.0,Lol dont need quotation marks for trash. I know Im trash to the sun and back. Ive played for quite a while on and off mainly blind and bots for fun but got back on recently wanting to actually improve.  Even while playing I kick myself for making stupid calls. For example jungler fighting nearby lane opponent and I went to help but my jungler died. I started to fight my laner though I knew the enemy jg was close by. By the time I processed this in my stupid brain I was dead. WHY DO I MAKE SUCH STUPID DECISIONS.

hm9ngf1,NoCreativityForName,11/27/2021,1,408.0,I’m not sure how good Riots filtering is but if you hardcore flame on euw in english imo you’re more likely to get banned. If you hardcore flame creatively in lets say Polish Romanian Finnish it’s probably easier to stay unbanned. Thats probably one of the reasons why euw is so passive aggresive.   But i’m just speculating

hma8orz,EROTIC_RAID_BOSS,11/27/2021,1,48.0,garen is the beginner bruiser character for sure.  but you have moba experience anyway. if you want to try top lane check out renekton pantheon illaoi sett darius mordekaiser. more advanced characters you might like are like camille or aatrox.  you can also play a lot of jungler bruisers like vi warwick diana xin zhao jarvan 4 or again more advanced ones like lee sin or viego  Id say look up some gameplay vids of each and see who interests you. I personally love aatrox and illaoi and illaoi should be one of the champs they offer for free like your second day. theyre kinda immobile but high damage and durability and rely a lot on abilities  &#x200B  warwick and vi are pretty beginner friendly junglers

hm9bzy8,Opening_Exit_2094,11/27/2021,1,14.0,Im a master-ranked player.  The best call was to start a fight since they had voli out of position and they were grouping up anyway. the enemy ashe is seen bot lane while vex’s team is seen nearby.   If I were a fed vex with ult zonyas and heal  it’s only obvious that I should be looking for a pick knowing that I have the damage to burst at least 2-3 on the squishy enemy team while guaranteeing that I remain alive long enough throughout the fight. I have a kayn who could follow up the damage for killing blows. Gwen and yasuo could clean up. We played it off around our comp. I would be making a risky yet worth play. What else do you want? Let them engage and kayle would free hit? Of course not. This was a good play.

hmawi32,UnNumbFool,11/27/2021,1,502.0,The wig thing is simply because the big ones you see are just shitty low quality wigs that are badly styled.  I mean low quality wigs are harder to style in general and by making the hair big youre basically hiding how shitty the wig is in general.  Im going with the girl didnt want to spend a couple hundred bucks(as jinxs ponytails are a fuck ton of hair) to make it a quality wig.  Truthfully a better quality regular hair blue wig with long ass extensions would probably be much better and easier to style naturally. But I mean not everybody has the money and even more so the skill to do that.

hmabom7,cav2010,11/27/2021,1,311.0,I think the main problem for this is his teammates drag this out to public which sent bunch of harassment to Upset family. Its fine if you frustrated and annoyed but you should confront him and ask for explanation instead of air it out on the web.
hma5drt,clearlove777771,11/27/2021,1,147.0,except the narrative that I and many other people have been bringing up is that REDDIT AND SOCIAL MEDIA DONT NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE SITUATION. Very little people are saying that his teammates shouldve not known more either. However a large part of the community has bee harassing upset because they too want to know everything about the situation which is not justified at all.
hm9eykv,mogadichu,11/27/2021,1,5.0,Ive been seeing hyper carries pop off more in general lately. The objective gold is so good for them because all it takes is one or two towers to drop and they just instantly outscale you even if you were ahead prior to that.   This patch if you dont have hypercarries you essentially have 3 choices:  - Close out fast (not gonna happen in low elo solo queue)   - Secure hexsoul  - Lose
hmaoczm,SP3EDI,11/27/2021,1,392.0,the drama that DL had to go through was affecting DL alone as a individual and he decided to stay strong. Upsets issue is about a living 3 party and the privacy of the 3 party goes before someone else. If it was something like Upset himself had depressions or what not then it would be more understanding to demand of him to speak to his teammates. in the case of a 3 party the team doesnt need to know what is going on.
hmbdk3x,Chokkitu,11/27/2021,1,,No thats old lore. In the current lore Swain overthrew Boram Darkwill and killed him by himself and is trying to remove The Black Roses (and by extension LeBlancs) influence from Noxus. Though she is somewhat responsible for Swains rise to power since she was the one that made Boram invade Ionia which was part of the reason why Swain rose to power.

hmb8xkf,Pokemon_132,11/27/2021,1,125.0,Im so surprised they went the route they did with the chem buff. Like increased damage against tanks??? really thats the idea you come up with CHEM dragon buff? Not like increased damage on missing health or flat magic/armor pen? Or a soul that makes it so your attacks apply a corrosive dot(with cooldown obviously) that does more damage the more missing health they have?   Nah its a full fucking revive so the guy i nearly died to gets a second chance to murder me as i run away or the teamfight we barely won immediately turns against us for a double ace. Did riot forget they have spaghetti code when it comes to these sorts of things? The thing feels so buggy.
hmamqff,SP3EDI,11/27/2021,1,392.0,because the other partys involved already mentioned it ? Alphari as fnatic itself already mentioned it. Its normal for a Player to ask his ex teammate about the team like alphari did. Its also normal for the org to ask upset about alphari and if he wants to play with him again. Like literally almost all the player changes in history work like this.

hma9a4u,Random_Guy_12345,11/27/2021,1,10.0,If team B has stronger teamfight than team A then team B should have stopped team A from grabbing soul. If team B despite having better teamfighting was unable to win those teamfights on dragon then either team B got outplayed or do not have such a clear advantage.  At the end of the day _something_ is needed to enable teams to close out games. I agree that there is a disparity on soul powers but id rather have _all_ souls on chemtech level than nerfing all to past-season-cloud level.

hm95ylx,AweKartik777,11/27/2021,1,16.0,No champ can do it early game. Some bruisers can do it late game or mid-game if they got pretty fed. Nasus at one point can just 2-3 shot turrets with his Q (with like a 1-2 seconds CD between casts) due to infinite stacking.       Some non-bruiser AP champs might be able to do it as well but not sure.
hma3ix9,ASSASSIN79100,11/27/2021,1,149.0,They already know something happened to his family. Thats why his situation is called a family emergency. The reason why its called a family emergency is so h donMt have to go into every detail about it.

hmaaw0t,XiaoRCT,11/27/2021,1,313.0,Its not about the privacy of someone else because it isnt about what happened its about how his teammates felt about him leaving.  People are acting as if this was an impossible situation when its obvious that there was an issue with communication between Upset and the team when it comes to actually clarifying to them what happened.   I seriously doubt that there was nothing in between what they were actually communicated and telling them the whole truth and exposing his wife like a lot of people are making it out to be.
hm8ud47,Murfalo,11/27/2021,1,132.0,straight up went searching through top posts this week trying to find liquid sign inspired x\_x
hmb44bw,stuffslols,11/27/2021,1,6.0,K. One at a time here:  Axiom: actually fairly balanced. If you build it on anyone but an assasin your trolling especially karthus who cant even use the ad or the lethality. She is decent but he becomes so much squishing to get an extra sheild up every so often that its still not really worth it.  On assasins its fairly strong but hardly anti fun except maybe on noc. You either rush it and lose out on your mythic first or push for it second by which point your at tier 2 ult and the cd is enough that itll be up every fight regardless. Unless you fed enough that you can get 2nd item before tier 2 ult but if that happens you deserve to be super strong.   The only time it really shines is through 2 ults in the dame fight... which were almost certainly already won given that you just killed 3-4 of them already so unless your in the really crazy situation  where its not a 1v2 and you wouldnt win without ult but thats really rare and honestly youd still probably win with a better item like youumus.  New lethal tempo: old lethal tempo sucked. It was bad used by about 6 Champs to fairly low degrees of use (jinx and kayle were basically the only Champs who used it regularly). It is now a good rune with actual uses where it has a niche that makes sense and is workable. Maybe it needs a number tuning but honestly I dont even think it needs that given that just make it so that empowered autos (Jax w yas q etc) dont proc it so they have to auto normally and itd be fine imo.  First strike: not at all nearly as good as klepto and absolutely fine balance wise. I play senna with first strike. I average around 600 gold generated on a average. game 300 on bad 900 on good game. That means that s one of the best users of it in the game (long range poke support whos trying to pick fights as much as possible for souls) its barely giving me more gold than futures market and doing far less damage than other damage runes to boot (PtA usually has 1000 damage on a bad game as senna. By .y math first strike is doing 1200 on a really good game.)  5he only  5hing Ill give you is that Chemtech is pretty powerful... so just nerf it after pre season. Idk make the health tick down faster increase its damage reduction prevent ult usage etc)  Seriously. This pre season has so much potential  if you guys would stop whining lol. Beat mage item weve gotten in a while a great slew of tank item changes to make them considerably better. Its been a good patch dont know why everyones all up in arms.

hm9zxzl,A_Forgotten_God,11/27/2021,1,2.0,They increased the jungles ult cooldown at first to help stabilize the laning phase a bit. The last iteration saw too much instability with the jungles ganking at level 3/4 while the laners were levels 2/3. Extending the ult cooldown for jungles only deters their early early ganks and gives laners a chance.

You just all in and pray for the best . Besides  youre kinda changing the goalposts : first your issue was with clutching ( which is why I answered like this )  then it was 1v2s that you disagree with . These two arent the same  but Im assuming ( in good faith ) that youre talking about 1v2 clutches ( for 1v1 for example Gwen doesnt clutch as hard while kled is the best single champion for it ) .

It will almost always result in losing a kill or getting killed yourself.  Could you add it to the list and just note that its not reproducible? Thanks!
hmb5yes,Chokkitu,11/27/2021,1,,ASol?  Technically Ryze since Runeterra would be wildly different if he didnt collect the World Runes. Or Jayce/Viktor since they invented Hextech which affected almost all Piltover/Zaun champions.  Edit: LeBlanc killed Mordekaiser which led to the foundation of Noxus which means shes affected all Noxian and Ionian champions a couple of Shuriman/Demacian ones (like Jarvan Xin Zhao Samira and Taliyah) Alistar Urgot Veigar and Vladimir off the top of my head. Technically she influenced Azir too since Cassiopeia is Noxian and her stabbing Sivirs back is part of the reason why Azir came back which means shes affected all of Shurima as well.

I really dont understand why Thornmail is like this and isnt just working in the same way as some others GW items where the only difference is the amount of HP of the target. Every enchanter has a heal/shield and every marskman has access to autoattacks. But not every tank has access to hard CCs.

hm9wwet,WintersEnvoy,11/27/2021,1,8.0,Playing with friends a lot? Yeah that experience is sorta dead high mmr friends will ruin low mmr ones real fast. And recovering takes ages it is genuinely sad.

hmbhp2u,Rias-senpai,11/27/2021,1,303.0,>Lethal Tempos range bonus for ADCs is only noticeable when the team is ahead when behind the ADC is mostly fighting people off themselves. A range increase does nothing when bruisers and assassins are sitting on your face.  Considering the amount of peel you receive in soloQ aswell the rune has very low value compared to the old LT. By the time youve autod someone 6 times in a fight youre usually past the point where 100 extra range is what allows you to space around the outskirts of a teamfight.   The laning power that most people who used LT before lost feels far greater than any situation Ive been in a teamfight with the new LT when Ive a 100 extra range but lower DPS and still have to play around some melee character in my face.

hm9f4q7,Opening_Exit_2094,11/27/2021,1,4.0,When youre playing with newbiew and lower ranks it’s best to focus on yourself. Kd you get a lead snowball it. ABUSE IT. For your skill level play easy-medium to pick up mid lane champs that could get ahead fast and carry games. If you could roam THEN ROAM. Shove/Push your wave under enemy tower before you base or roam. Try mastering Diana Predator Veigar Predator Galio Fizz.
hmarzpy,Thought_Ladder,11/27/2021,1,14.0,32 here..  When working full time I would set limits on how many games to try and maintain a good life balance.  If I say Im only going to do one normal sticking to it is key.  No just play till I win one  or but I got autofilled.  Find a system that works for you if youre still enjoying the game.
hma8c5r,Mantial,11/27/2021,1,,You obviously dont have to go into specifics but you also have to remember that your teammates coaching staff etc. have invested thousands of hours and a year of their life into that team and you leaving effectively means all that time is wasted so you have to make sure that those people understand that you have no other choice but to leave.  I dont think Upset left for a small reason but I do think that someone dropped the ball hard when it came to communicating the reason why Upset left to the team.

hmae4r0,TheMightyBaloon,11/27/2021,1,18.0,Role is fine the issue with adc is that the lane requires the 2 people to be on the same wavelength.  Not to mention support can literally leave your lane and screw you because they have automatic gold generation and will be useful even if they are down 2 to 3 levels because how the role functions. They could also auto push your lane when it doesnt need to be pushed forcing you into positions where you have to overextend.  Which is what makes adc a horrible role to play because you are at the mercy of your support and you as an adc dont matter given how soloq fights go. You will be left alone in teamfights and will be the target of divers.  So you are forced to develop mechanical skill to compensate for everything else. Which is why high elo adc generally are have good micro and are good mechanically.

But the soul from Riot feels like it is literally gone. Id be willing to even pay for stuff like this just so that it feels refreshing once in a while. Nevermind that though heres a debonair skinline.   For the map skins in general there was a small group of modders who literally made an entire [Bilgewater themed map](https://youtu.be/VONVBp2y0PY?t=97) including minions. Goes to show that sometimes a dedicated community puts more effort into things like this than the actual company itself.

Players get replaced for better players in any sport constantly. Considering it wasnt Upset activly reaching out on his own but just giving his opinion to the org their really isnt a problem.
hma26qa,Dmienduerst,11/27/2021,1,,Sorry never been a hip hop guy and it comes through occasionally.  I didnt mean it that hip hop was the problem more comparing it to the original post saying pop songs were the issue.  Enemy is fine and if the band wasnt animated in the scene it works for it.    As for the Ekko scene I agree with you everything about that works and the music is a big piece.  Heck even the weird shoulder shrug from Jinx works because that character just is insanity personified.  Its one of many examples in arcane where the scene animation and music all are produced to complement the other 2.

hmb53pm,LoLrovex,11/27/2021,1,341.0,I think the question was directed at what I found most hard -> easy. From just carrying games I could do it better on every other role so putting support as hardest role only made sense. If I was climbing to challenger support would be easiest.

hm9nn5x,Voller_Faulheit,11/27/2021,1,94.0,Yeah exactly that would be great tower dives are waaaay too easy right now.  Outside of that giving towers increasing rate of fire and true damage would help a lot. Actually make them a threat.

hmbpogr,LoLrovex,11/27/2021,1,374.0,Take ranks out of the entire equation and play to be better than yourself from a previous game. When you have this mindset all these anxietys will go away with it since the battle is just with yourself and not the enemy.
hmaz4ld,LoLrovex,11/27/2021,1,341.0,The whole being mia pinged is a tricky one. If youre doing the right thing then you just need to mute the person for example you gank enemy top and wave isnt fully crashed. You will need to push it out for them or they will tp and freeze so in that case we just go with the right play. If you cant finish games you need to be rotating objectives earlier and forcing enemy to fight you drake is a great win con especially in lower ranks.

hm976m0,BBQMasterDad,11/27/2021,1,7.0,On a real note you shoulda been using your ult more that fight it’s free damage on reset and applies passive stacks. Additionally since Baron was free there you could’ve roamed mid and helped push out that wave to advance it/stack it for baron buff minions. Just some additional thoughts.

hmaqkm5,OvOxxx,11/27/2021,1,392.0,I mean isnt the gravity of the situation clear? Upsets biggest goal has always been worlds to prove himself but was always denied. Hell not even staying to play the first game against Deft and then leave should be enough reason to understand the situation Hylli and Yamato did. And the way Yamato speaks about it tells you its something painful. Upset did also tell his teammates well in advanced that there was family issues that could lead to an emergency.  We all react different and feel entitled more or less Bwipo and Adam is more(maybe nisqy) the rest it less.  Fnatic org knows and understands which should tell you alot they need to keep making the brand bigger and leaving the pinnacle of the year does not fly if its nothing of great importance.  Teammates where informed but the details or the lack of was not enough for some. Bwipo was probably out anyway and Rookie Adam got offended by Fnatic wanting arguably the best toplaner EU has produced. Nisqy got the short end if this which is sad.

In the end no one win in this the fact that a bunch of people harass him and his family because of this incident tell me a lot to each of their own I guess on how they handle situation.  If you not happy with him then confront him behind the scene to air it out like that that tell me that his teammates is pretty childish.

Tbh one specific build was intended for Fiora but was built on Camille... But it wasnt buffed in meanwhile and they used to run almost same items. Even now they kinda do this whole mythic items thing kinda makes them build diff items.  Im stupid and obtuse and dont check patch notes.  >I am spell AA based assassin. Rengar builds crit. And guess what? AAing enemies with crit items hurts them.  Rengar builds *maybe* one crit item and he doesnt build it for the crit. Crit is an objectively bad stat on rengar. It performs poorly. This isnt debatable. Its in the stats. Just because Dekar can build full ap and win games doesnt make it the optimal strategy. You cant take suboptimal items/runes and win a game and then go Oh it works I won a game! Thats called anecdotal evidence.   Rengar has auto attacks and he builds attack damage. This doesnt inherently make him an aa based assassin. Talon is not an auto attack based carry. Riven is not an auto attack based carry. Zed is not an auto attack based carry. **Rengar is not an auto attack based carry.** If you actually play correctly most of your damage comes from your abilities because landing multiple auto attacks is never reliable. Because its dogshit. Melee range auto attack carries have to have an incredibly strong and persistent survival tool or they get nuked from fucking orbit. Master Yi Q. Viego reset. Having one empowered W does not protect you enough.   Were not arguing about what works for you. Were arguing about what is best. HoB. is. trash. I dont even have to say HoB is trash *on rengar* its just fucking trash on its own. Its only playable on like kalista twitch tryndamere. You saying its viable on rengar is exactly as respectable as that cheese HoB darius strat that was going around 2 years ago. If it ever wins it wins because the person youre playing against doesnt even know what the rune does and cant play/adapt around it.  Bro you dont even know what a fallacy is. Rengar being a 0 impact character if youre not capable of oneshotting at least one person on the other team is just a fact. You dont have to worry about the tanks. Youre rengar. Theyre not your job.   This was a fun way to spend the last 10 minutes of my shift tonight but Im not going to come back and give you any more free elo again. You can either choose to stick to what you think is best or accept that sometimes its better to let go of your ego and look towards what actually works. All that being said I dont give a shit how you choose to play your games but dont come into a public forum and mislead people who dont know better with your home-stirred-shit-soup builds.  Have a great day!!  -- wow I shouldnt have even spent the time typing this out scrolled up and seent you talking about the triple q combo... which hasnt been possible for YEARS. You dont even play the game anymore LMAO!

hmajnff,CanIBeFIREIn10Years,11/27/2021,1,10.0,I totally understand what you have gone through because it happened to me last week like 3-4 games in a row where we had early advantages i.e our adc xayah was 4/0 or we were up 5-10 kills but someone on my team just started flaming the jgl for not ganking or mid for inting or some crazy flaming I cant recall and you probably could predict what happened right? The one that got flamed just afk-ed or inted even more. I then just took a long break from rank and started playing norms/draft/aram just for fun. I think a couple of days later SOMEHOW I joined our LoL discord and found there are some good groups looking for team mates at the same level. I found one good duo SO FAR. This is just my own experience and opinion.  If its frustrating and not fun for you atm then take a break and come back whenever you feel ready.  Good luck with your decision and have a great weekend!
hm9no2o,noahkillis,11/27/2021,1,11.0,maybe try using the little time you have to play to play with friends. It always makes it better especially if u got disc or something like that.
hm9w0wi,Joatorino,11/27/2021,1,36.0,Where exactly did they mention they wanted it to make it better for ad carries? I swear ad players think they are the center of the universe. They just wanted to make the rune better in general and make it more appealing for everyone. You dont like it? Awesome go pta instead. Or fleet. Or hail of blades. If conqueror is not a bruiser rune then lethal tempo is not a marksman rune either

hmai1dt,Random_Guy_12345,11/27/2021,1,23.0,Ill clarify.  If one team is ahead enough that the _other_ team needs soul especially chemtech to put an even fight then the team that was ahead missplayed (read: failed to push their advantage/failed to prevent the soul/failed to close the game).  If the missplay is big enough it may cost that team the game.

I cycle trough games and i am always pleasantly surprised how communities in online games are so much nicer. No mans Sky Guild Wars 2 Runescape WoW... the difference from LoL & CSGO is huge. Btw huge difference doesnt mean trolls arent any in MMOs they still are just in really low numbers and in PVP modes.  Also single player games are awesome you can spend years playing 4X games.

I don’t see a reason why people can’t be happy with their rank. Besides platinum is literally above average so they clearly know how to play the game lol. It’s not that deep
hmauf1q,Exalardosv8,11/27/2021,1,14.0,>taking axiom arc as a first item in aram  Eh at least is nor sr  on aram i could see it work better but what champ even wants it maybe lethality cait? (couse assasins dont really need it)

hmapfga,AchievingAtaraxia,11/27/2021,1,94.0,> Hang  Hangs buyout has to be insanely high hes been incredibly good this year and I believe hes only 18 which means hes got a lot more time to improve.  RA would be smoking crack to let him go hes a big reason the team looked so good this Summer.

hmb1tc1,LoLrovex,11/27/2021,1,341.0,I was a lot more aware of what my teammates needed and how I should play around them. Its really nice to know whats going on in each lane and being able to expect what will happen. In raw playstyle I dont think its changed but Ive definitely won many games from just having knowledge of other roles.
hm9wvxj,rimidalv25,11/27/2021,1,1540.0,Ornn and malph is actually the same. Theyre still rooted after their respective spells. Malph just has a dash during the immunity

hm9pze3,Rodniconii,11/27/2021,1,,True but I dont think arcane disregards it so much that its just distracting to the story. Like how in Sol Diana doesnt just end everything on the spot. Or Irelia can literally use something else as a weapon thats not here family crest even though thats like an important part of her character. Thats like if in arcane Vi was going everywhere with a sniper rifle and Jinx was using her fist to beat everyone.
hmbltpv,Neonvaporeon,11/27/2021,1,,Thing is most ads scale very well with xp (ez Lucian jinx) and later levels are worth more stats than early ones. Supports on the other hand dont care about levels besides certain breakpoints (2 or 3 depending on the champ 6 and 13 for the item.) Those combined means in 90% of cases you should not leach xp when the ads are JUST farming (if your ad is getting dove or zoned you need to help etc.)

hmbfx9m,NymphomaniacWalrus,11/27/2021,1,303.0,This is true for bruisers as well though. LT is noticeably worse late game for them compared to Conqueror.  I do think its sad that adcs dont really have a late game option for keystones right now though.
hmaov5l,GGABueno,11/27/2021,1,76.0,You are both correct. Decision making on characterizations was awful but the League client is also terrible place to tell a compelling (and big) story like that one.

hm97mss,RitoBuffTalonPls,11/27/2021,1,58.0,I dont really understand why you hate him. He s not even that strong. Like most people call him a lane bully when in fact he is not that strong. Like his power comes when he hits an early stun lvl 1 and he has Dorans Blade. But other than that he doesnt do very much. His kit is telegraphed af. Dont stay in a minion wave or you are getting stunned and he throws some auto attacks on you chunking off a little but of your healthbar. Aside from his autos his damage comes from his W which is predictable and dodgeable. Like it literally screams STOP HITTING ME YOUR THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE YOU LL GET HIT BY SOME TRUE DAMAGE. His counter is that he gets kited into oblivion. Like literally you have 2 options:  -either A you engage with your ultimate your team follows you you stun 2-3 people from the enemy team and you win the teamfight or -B you engage but you die miserablly because you lack any form of mobility. He cant 1  v 5 after he uses his W he just dies and his W can be easilly avoided by simplly side stepping the ability. His laning phase is usually the part where he shines. Other than that his teamfighting is mediocre.

On top of that he’s taken a year off from pro play so he hasn’t been playing at LCS level. No scrims or synergy with anyone over the past year. On top of his poor form lately other rosters in LCS seem very stacked next year with all of the new imports like Hans sama.

So yes I was indeed arguing that having to justify yourself for leaving your job like that is common practice in any serious business as opposed to what the person I was responding to was saying.

They could do the reverse and make them weaker on melee champions but I think they just need a straight up nerf especially Immortal Shieldbow the shield is absurd and gives you health and sustain on top of that? Thats a bit much for a defensive item makes squishy champions unkillable a lot of the times.

hmb1ex9,LoLrovex,11/27/2021,1,341.0,I think plat junglers get mind controlled to do things too much.

No matter their sex political opinion race magic or whatever. You just need to be strong enough to achieve it. This does not mean you most be a powerful soldier. Its about strength in what you do. Be it a chef a painter a musician or a soldier. Yes on top of that theirs also a harsh war culture that comes from long years of expansionism and they have often gone to war with other nations like most recently Ionia. But this is also partially due to the harsh land of noxus where few crops can grow very little is able to live so they have been forced to invade other kingdoms to survive.  Furthermore one of the three leaders is actively trying to work against preventing the void from growing to powerful.
hmb6h1e,Outfox3D,11/27/2021,1,264.0,Yeah theres a lot of people who used to use it who now have nothing. Its probably twitchs best rune still (maybe HoB?) which is just a travesty.

hmbpssg,wo0topia,11/27/2021,1,225.0,Well there three likely reasons why they dont anymore.  1. Its only winter for the northern hemisphere so maybe its to be more inclusive.  2. I know in the past they have said that chanpions and abilities were meant to stand out against the primary SR map and that the alternates cause visibility issues.  3. Climate change in runeterra has created warmer winters with less snow.

Per the official timeline released by Riot Forge the game takes place a year before Sentinels of Light yet Illaoi keeps the necklace with Viego inside. How the hell will they explain that?!<
hm97tl2,reportedbymom,11/27/2021,1,,Excuse me? You really say YOUR bug to gey get tracked and fixed hows that hes or our bug?    Isnt the bug direct result of Riots inconsistency and lack of effort? Dont get me wrong not a diss but every bug in live version of a game is preventable. Yes EVERY BUG. With good management high stantards clean and well designed code (i think Riot is fucked with this one before LoL 2 comes out) high work morale (i think this also Riot is fucked sexual harashment and other very unethical shit). And many other ways... But i would never call those bugs YOUR bugs to a player that makes pretty damn good report about bugs that are caused by MISTAKES of riot employees involved with the code. Instead i would send him some goodies...

hm94o2a,Terozu,11/27/2021,1,98.0,Yeah but thats not really definitive.  I ship the two always have.  But there is no them yet.  Caitlyn really felt only slightly interested romantically her naive nature suggests she already sees Vi as a partner but not quite yet as a \*partner\* (though shes clearly interested shes not as latched on as Vi is.  Which makes sense Vi was in prison for like 10 years and heres Cait to bust her out and be nice to her in spite of Vis suspicions).  Of course this was season one.  We have time to go further with this in season two.  And while they didnt make Caitlyn explicit in season one the ship is popular enough that I fully expect at least a kiss at some point in season two.

Well I havent quit yet and dont plan to anytime soon because I love the game and want to hit certain milestones.  If you really enjoy the game I dont see any issue with keeping on playing it as long as you have fun.
hmbfogm,happygreenturtle,11/27/2021,1,111.0,While it is an example of playing non-soloQ League playing in TCS is not really the same thing as playing inhouses with pros and academy players.   People used TCS as an example that Tyler would do well if he played in LCS xd
hmbqgif,No-Glass3257,11/27/2021,1,181.0,Yeah although Khan didnt get much field time he got along really well with all his teammates but Khan is also probably one of the friendliest leauge players you can meet lol.
hmb0u83,LoLrovex,11/27/2021,1,341.0,Thank you.      I always thought as jungle as a role that impacts the map and Kayn has the best mobility in the game because of his ability to skip over terrain. I think Kayn in soloq has to be by far the best jungler since he has so much versatility (blue red purple forms). His w/r is middle of the pack because I think the champ is also popular but people bring down the w/r as they dont actually play him.
hm95u3u,ForShurimaIGuess,11/27/2021,1,42.0,Can you look into Azir ult bug? You can reproduce the bug literally 100% of the time and it’s been here for months..
hm9ysa3,BurrStreetX,11/27/2021,1,51.0,These arent as cool as I thought. It isnt generating the whole image it just edits the image slightly to look a tad different based off what you enter. It always starts with the same image and SLIGHTLY puts a filter over it sadly.
hmbp9uu,Serene_Skies,11/27/2021,1,107.0,Well they also said that Kayles visual change was because armor wouldnt make sense on a champion that is supposed to be squishy but then released Gwen who has one of the highest base armors in the game and is wearing a frilly dress.
hm9c15b,Surveyorman,11/27/2021,1,4.0,Play solo. You dont need anyone but yourself.
hmajzl1,Exclarius,11/27/2021,1,376.0,> Communication can happen before this but if it hasnt now is a good time. Its what a decent normal human being would do.  Theres a difference between communicating and going into details. Upset has communicated. You want him to communicate details. To quote [IWDs tweet](https://twitter.com/IWDominateLoL/status/1464623024548847621):  > Upset informed his organization and his coach about the details of his family issue (who both confirmed the severity of it).  If people want further information it just means they don’t trust Yamato/Fnatic and want to make their own judgement on the legitimacy of the situation.  ____________________________________   > Oh and they arent allowed to be angry because upset is still playign victim for him being a dick.  No one is saying they are not allowed to be mad. However Im not sure if the solution to being mad is to cause more harassment in the direction of the person youre mad at. If I were mad and you were to send other people over to harass me that is not going to make me want to disclose details to you.  > If you are still emotional - get the FUCK off the team and take an extended break.  Would you look at that the offseason a period of multiple months where they are not playing together (as much). Almost resembles something like an extended break huh?
hm8w1kn,deeeeksha,11/27/2021,1,20.0,1000% agreed. I don’t recommend it as a brand new player because you’ll just be too confused the entire time but once you figure out abilities to a very basic extent it’s great for finding new champs
hmbnzmk,richter114,11/27/2021,1,53.0,No fucking way this isn’t a drawing. This is spot on! Kudos.
hmb0alw,LoLrovex,11/27/2021,1,341.0,So in s8 I played so much syndra I basically first picked it everygame because I thought the champion was so strong. Even though in comp shes picked a lot Ive felt theres always been better champions in her role as a control mage. Shes only really good for getting prio early but in soloq I would consider her not that good. Obviously if you play well on her shes still a fine champion but a champ like orianna or currently first strike viktor will do her job better.
hma3sh9,ItzBleKz,11/27/2021,1,6.0,Temporal fix : You can serch Aram balance changes in google and then you enter to the lol wiki you just ctrl+f the champ you want to play
hm8w1v1,Zombra808,11/27/2021,1,20.0,Viego passive has special properties because it would be too broken if he reset tower agro. All untargetabilities should remove tower agro aside from Viego passive.

hm9swmd,SeleniaAdrasteia,11/27/2021,1,266.0,the best part of playing support is standing by the wave and poking anyone that goes to farm when i see an enchanter sitting a mile behind the adc just spamming heals i imagine they have to be autofilled looks so boring
hmbguju,ProfessorActual1633,11/27/2021,1,174.0,I think FPX management failed here.  It was obvious Nuguri was gonna be different from Gimgoon Khan or Doinb.  I think all those guys spoke fluent mandarin before going to FPX.  A Korean coach with LPL experience would have worked much better than Steak.    I know the documentary cuts out a lot of stuff but youre telling me theres no footage of the coach doing any strategy sessions or even having an opinion on the whole thing other than telling the players to work harder?  You dont think these guys work hard enough?  If that was the case you should have told the players before the match.  That Krystal person didnt seem to know anything about the game just taking care of LWX.    They should have hired a live in translator to work with Nuguri and the rest of the team.  If Im spending 2.8 million on someone you better believe Im supporting him the best I can.  FPX vs EDG just seemed a difference in professionalism.  All their players are breaking down (Tian Crisp Nuguri Doinb) and theres no evidence they did anything about it.  These guys are investments you need to take care of them not grind them into dust.

hmbplby,tageeboy,11/27/2021,1,588.0,You are very correct. Ive always heard about League of Legends when Im checking on gaming news but never paid any attention as Im into a very focused game type. Keep in mind Im old so that may taint my view. But I saw the show on Netflix when it was released and LOVED IT! told everyone at work how great it was. For the first time ever I watched some LoL twitch play the other day and it made sense. I had a general understanding of what the different teams were about. I plan to give it a try during the Xmas time off I take each year. Dont get me wrong I know absolutely nothing beyond the show but it caught my interest and made me want to try it out. I cant be alone.

hma71cz,Reiir,11/27/2021,1,145.0,Fully agree with Doublelift (even though I really dont like his personality). Then again most of League pros are petulant children who havent had the opportunity to learn proper social skills thus believing that the excuse kids in highschool use to dodge class (i.e urgent family matters) works when so much money and honestly peoples futures are on the line.   I have 0 sympathy for Upset in this case as I think there are ways to explain your situation to your own teammates without breaching the privacy of your loved ones where everyone at least understands why youre leaving.

She basically turned her back on both Vi and Silco AND made herself #1 enemy of Piltover  I understand the freak-out moments of her character are cliche and over the top to make it look like that she is just crazy but its still clearly a result of her PTSD and drugs

This kind of clip has been seen by the whole western world that spoke english and played the game at the time.  BTW the majority being pisslow is just a fact. Even in Riot Games the majority is bronze  Btw even your comment doesnt make sense. Its not just a reference its also a fact. Jungle and support are the easiest roles by far even though like all 5 roles skillcap is very high the skill required to do jungle and supp roles at a decent level is outrageously low

Go into the real world and try pulling off what Upset did at your company and try coming back the next day - I wont spoil the outcome for you but if certainly wouldnt end up well!   When youll be in your 30s youll realize that Upset fucked up his entire team who worked hard for an entire year and they have every reason to be pissed at what he pulled off! Put yourself in Adams shoes Im surprised he went off so lax on him.   TLDR Upset fucked up his entire team and left them hanging and he cannot even disclose the reason to his teammates who worked extremely hard the entire season. Stop being SIMPS its obviously related to his gf.

hmbq9hw,JoeMartBarsik,11/27/2021,1,156.0,No I dont believe so but I think both Ryze and Shen have hinted to a main character in the Runeterra universe.  Ryze is looking for someone who has the ability to let go for Ryze can not keep collecting and safeguarding the World runes as his time is coming to an end.  Shen is looking for a student who will follow the ways of Balance every student of his fails this task but there is someone out there.  With the Void brewing to make their first move Targon scheming plans and Noxus planning more warfare between Ionia it is only a matter of time before this character shows up.   My guess is that this character will be the Invoker to League of Legends and be able to use World Runes.

hm9tvjf,nyasiaa,11/27/2021,1,,what part of not improving until elo inflation pushes them to plat (not really inflation just riot changing the percentages for each rank to be lower) is exactly doing well?  if someone was iron and decided to try hard and got to gold thats an achievement good job you can be proud of your improvement staying in gold for 6 years after that is nothing special  taking 6 years to barely get to plat in preseason doesnt show any dedication to improvement not to mention its achieved by playing eve so the person clearly doesnt care about improvement and just plays to win and cheese the plat   and while yes someone can be proud of whatever rank they are in that does not mean they are playing the game correctly even if you define good as better than average you still have to admit that basically every single click a gold/plat/diamond and especially below player does is basically a mistake and an incorrect decision

hmah7ty,KogMawOfMortimidas,11/27/2021,1,116.0,Lethal Tempos range bonus for ADCs is only noticeable when the team is ahead when behind the ADC is mostly fighting people off themselves. A range increase does nothing when bruisers and assassins are sitting on your face. People get dicked a handful of times by a lethal tempo Jinx that they let freely reset and run around the fight and think that the rune is broken on ranged but dont bat an eye at getting run down by everyone and their mother using predator or how conqueror was being used by like 6 out of 10 people in each game.  Whats really the problem is Yasuo and Yone (and slightly less so Tryndamere). These melee ADCs ruin everything for everyone. They stop Riot from properly balancing Crit chance and Crit damage ADC items Shieldbow IE Mortal Reminder fucking everything. The double crit passive for both of them is just fucking ridiculous Ive done the math on it before but here we go again. Yasuo and Yone at 2 items (Shieldbow and IE) have 100% crit chance for 1.89x damage (1.89x overall DPS increase) vs anyone else with 2 items having 40% chance for 1.75x damage (1.3x overall DPS increase). This alone means Yasuo and Yone are doing 45% MORE DPS than any normal champion on auto attacks alone. Next Yasuo and Yone can reliably weave 2 autos between each Q which has a 1.33s cooldown. This means they are landing 3 attacks (2 autos + 1 Q) every 1.33s or 2.25 attacks per second. Now with Lethal Tempo if they can weave 3 autos in between they would be reaching 3 attacks per second on average. Most other ADCs at 2 items are maybe in the 1.5-2 attacks per second range if they got Zeal second although many go LDR and so wont achieve that level of attack speed. Thus Yasuo and Yone attack at least ~28% faster than other ADCs at 2 items. Yasuo also ignores 50% of the bonus armor of his target basically a free LDR and Yone does half magic damage making armor itemization against him less effective and also amplifies damage by 25-35% in his E.   Adding all that bullshit up Yasuo and Yone are outputting up to twice as much in terms of DPS compared to anyone else just twice as much raw damage not even starting on their mobility CC Windwall shielding everything else. This doubled DPS translates to doubled lifestealing which is why the anime bros abuse Shieldbow so hard. You cant balance Shieldbow and lifesteal for ADCs without Yasuo and Yone just ruining it for everyone. They love the shield love the stats and can draintank anyone with massive DPS converting to massive healing. Just remove their double crit passive please. Its ruined everything. Lethal Tempo looks so ridiculous on them because they are already ridiculous.

hmbejow,nathe__,11/27/2021,1,12410.0,Shimmer affects you. The addicts. The kid Silco tested it on   Though I can agree that the Shimmer wouldn’t have really change what Jinx did because she was already crazy beforehand. It was just there to show the audience that shes now officially Jinx as well as with the chair and the things in her head. Just storytelling. But if youre saying Jinx isnt a result of Powders PTSD then youre just wrong. 1000% Powder wouldve turned out normal if she still had her mom Vander and Vi.  Yes I know Jinxs freak-out-moments are cliche of a crazy person but you cant expect that much realism with PTSD from an animated fantasy

hmbewb8,MoonDawg2,11/27/2021,1,,> Are seriously comparing animation cancels to that shit? Have you ever seen videos of Kayns staying in base and using global Ws to nuke people? Its literally the same principile and its just as gamebreaking since it works with hexflash. This is just redicolous.  One is a global bug that calls for a champ to be disabled and the other is one that riot cant be bothered to fix. And yes animation cancels are likely the most impactful bug in the history of league since the power level of several champs completely depends on it.  > Juggernauts arent supposed to fall off juggernauts are supposed to be durable and hard hitting but slow both in movements and in animations.  Anything that can be kitted is supposed to fall off by late game. Youre a tank who trades cc for damage. Yes you fall off.  > The other day i was playing Mundo 10 cs per minute and i was 100-0 both by Divine Sunder Akali and by a 3 items Kindred when i was full build with tabis and omens. Tankiness isnt a thing after 3 items the only tankiness is oneshotting before you get oneshotted. Something that juggernauts cant do without summoners  I have no idea how you have this issue on mundo since he is the win more jugger atm. Opressively overpowered if ahead and extremely useless if behind  If you have the game please just record this 100-0 situations since this sounds just completely ridiculous
hm99ybs,Unbeatable61,11/27/2021,1,1520.0,The whole Vi/Cait ship felt so rushed like their screentime together on the first 6 episodes doesnt exceed 20 minutes yet writers are forcing romantic relationship that felt it has been existing for 10 yearslike even if Vi/Cait had that long relationship it doesnt make sense at all to leave ur sister that u caused her traumaslike wtf vi was thinking after what Ekko said earlier?it was clear that one of ekko or jinx would die in that fight and yet vi left themiam 100% sure if vi had talked to jinxshe could have restored powder back  But on the bright side we got that ekko/jinx epic fight scene xd
hmaiulw,Higais,11/27/2021,1,441.0,One of the only good shows that I have to skip the intro. The songs not as bad as some other ID hits like Thunder but man does it suck anyway.   Every song of theirs is just like I am a legend or everyones my enemy everyones out to get me.
hmbal7s,Psyr1x,11/27/2021,1,52.0,Lissandra impacts the most stories.     And it’s very unlikely the mage Jayce encountered was Ryze.   Ryze is not the only runic mage we’ve encountered in the lore and visually the mage looked nothing like Ryze.   Not only were they not blue/purple a coloration Ryze has had for multiple centuries they didn’t even have the same markings.

hm9t0jx,SaulJoker,11/27/2021,1,60.0,So just get Death’s Dance Force of Nature and/or Gargoyle Stoneplate.  Honestly I don’t understand why you seem to have a problem with Thornmail. Juggernauts that lack CC should be building Chempunk if AD. And if you need more resistances overall you get Stoneplate. If you need just physical damage reduction you get Death’s Dance. If you need magical damage reduction you get Force of Nature.  It’s really not that complicated.
hmbanyd,RedZoomTV,11/27/2021,1,4.0,This is especially needed as I almost just lost a game due to this -      I was dead I had 2 teammates alive while the enemy team only had 1 zed. My jax was going to the nexus which was completely open while MF for whatever reason pinged the hextech dragon for jax to help her.     What ended up happening is Jax almost killed zed but zed lived and MF solod dragon instead of following jax. The whole time MF was Pinging dragon I was trying to spam ping the nexus and MF to end the game as the enemy team only had 1 person alive and it wouldve been free.     I only use pings to communicate as in all my years of playing league since season 2 Ive been talking in chat non stop mostly useless things and gotten many of my accounts perma banned because of it. Therefore I decided to disable my chat completely not even being able to open it so that I would prevent further bans and actually focus on the game. That worked as I got my first honor check point in pretty much ever and Ive gotten a higher rank

hmbpcg2,Berserk72,11/27/2021,1,86.0,The problem is we have no idea what the pandemic did to schedules. Ruined King is great but late. SoL was on time but buggy and poor quality. The novels didnt match the in game event that did not the cinematic. Even the champion design in particular Vex also missed deadlines but at least was not unfinished.   The concept was amazing and I would love to see attempted again but the execution was just not Riot standard which Arcane rubbed the salt in. Runed King is a solid 8-9 game 30 hours for 30 bucks.   For Lucian and Senna lets hope Thresh pulls them back in because those 3 are some of the most popular characters even post SoL.
hmboye9,TheDunai,11/27/2021,1,4.0,Thanks for the answer! But there are people who does give an F about their Flex rank. I get your points but why ruin others game when you can play normal that does not count at all?
hma3chv,fojek17,11/27/2021,1,4.0,Infernal is basically game-ending buff for a poke composition.  Mountain drag is basically game-ending buff against dive/burst comps.

You say they have but in the documentary i dont see anything special compare to EDG atmosphere it’s just so different EDG also has their problem and worked their ass off to make the roster work check their documentary and see how much effort they put compare to FPX.  Overall it’s the problem of both side end of conversation and i dont want to argue with you.

hmbmg6r,szczur_mysz,11/27/2021,1,,More than tank nerfs I hate the fact that it straight up buffs the most annoying gameplay invented in season 10 which is get low then just press that Goredrinker button. More than nerfing tanks it BUFFS the most broken class right now which are bruisers. Like since season 10 Ive seen more last stand than other to runes not talking about revitalise becoming bruiser rune instead of support rune. And then we give them even more damage beacuse why not. Chemtech drake shouldnt be even added to the game noone would be mad if riot released only 1 new dragon.

hmbq2z9,montlogan,11/27/2021,1,70.0,This isn’t surprising. Pyke and all other ability reset champion have their cool downs occur after the initial cast. It’s technically on “cool down” even if you can cast it because it’s a recast. Even spells such as Camille Q interact this way because if they didn’t you’d be punished for holding onto them.
