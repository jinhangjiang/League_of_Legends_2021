hkivu5o,brokencompass502,2021-11-13 18:36:50,4,23,I dont think he was booking a prostitute thats kind of a wild assumption. Could have been an apartment for him and his wife his kid his partner his grandchild who knows.   He was just an old guy who probably never used Airbnb before and didnt really do much research. Thought he was booking a private place. Or someone booked it for him etc.   He probably was embarrassed and just took off.

hkj33zb,marglobal,2021-11-13 19:31:51,0,12,Airbnb noted guest account. great outcome!
hkjbwsl,Enough_Insurance,2021-11-13 20:38:16,1,3,Ask a lawyer
hkjecth,dentedmuffin,2021-11-13 20:56:48,3,3,I work for a lender. All of our Deed of Trusts state that transferring title is prohibited. If we find someone has transferred title we demand the loan to be paid off within 30 days.  Read your DOT and see what it says
hkjha4o,Jimmy761,2021-11-13 21:20:28,1,3,Assumption of current mortgage is an option if lender allows but fannie and freddie loans don‚Äôt allow LLC assumptions.  Also the LLC can buy the home if the LLC can qualify for a mortgage and you give personal guarantee.  I would say just run the airbnb business as an LLC.
hkji8lt,rarabk,2021-11-13 21:28:18,2,11,Aw maaaaaaaan. I‚Äôve just decided to quit using Airbnb (as a guest) because Airbnb has lost its magic. Stuff like this is why I used to love Airbnb-ing.  So delightful‚Äîthanks for sharing this. :)
hkjiqdv,kbnmyey,2021-11-13 21:32:08,1,23,Same. Reached out to Proper and they said they are not accepting anymore for 2021. Any luck?
hkjk5e7,kbnmyey,2021-11-13 21:43:16,1,20,Who do you use? And what specifics are included in your policy? That way I can refer to it when getting this policy. Thank you!!
hkjm08z,Exact_Common120,2021-11-13 21:58:22,0,6,That‚Äôs exciting! I would make sure to communicate what toiletries to provide (if any) and for what length of stay the guest can expect them to be provided.   I know some hosts who only provide 1 weeks worth of toilet paper and then the guest is expected to manage needs after that (personally we provide up to 2 weeks of essentials and then guest is on their own) given our nightly rate & discount this has been a good fit for those we host.   Outside of that - a nice note bottle of wine and great communication can go a long ways to securing 5 star reviews early in your journey!

hkjsom1,prince-of-dweebs,2021-11-13 22:52:01,13,6,I frequently stay two plus weeks and it always bugs me when there‚Äôs no vacuum cleaner and/or quick mop accessible. I now bring a compact vacuum with me but it would be much easier for guests to keep your place clean if they can access a vacuum and/or quick mop.   Also we are always disappointed when there‚Äôs only one roll of toilet paper or paper towels or if it‚Äôs the cheapest type. It doesn‚Äôt cost much to provide extra rolls of a good brand and save guests an immediate trip to the store. From my experience showing a little goodwill is reflected in my reviews.   Last one I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm in the majority but I don‚Äôt want half empty jars of jam or mayonnaise or loose eggs without a date. I have no idea how long they‚Äôve been there. I toss the eggs bc I have no idea how long they‚Äôve been there and don‚Äôt touch the jam (so for the next guest it‚Äôs now two weeks older) so at least for us leaving open items is not buying any goodwill.
hkjtzcu,Enough_Insurance,2021-11-13 23:02:48,2,4,Youre going to have a lot of pissed off guests even if you write that down in your description
hkjzhxq,RokBo67,2021-11-13 23:52:50,5,23,What exactly do you have written in all caps?...  **NOT A BANG SHACK!**  üòÇ
hkk3917,H2O_APARTMENT,2021-11-14 00:30:27,2,23,True. I have quite a few guests thinking they booked the whole apartment when in reality they are only booking a room. I rent out 2 rooms on Airbnb and stay in the 3rd room room in my 3-room apartment.  Hall and dining area are common spaces. No matter how I tried there will also be people thinking otherwise.ü§¶ü§¶  Would really be thankful if someone can solve this problem.
hkk4ux3,kabajian,2021-11-14 00:47:50,3,23,Wouldn‚Äôt this problem be easily solved if complete sentences were used in the description‚Äîmany times such as ‚Äúthe private room is on the second floor of the host‚Äôs home and includes ‚Ä¶‚Äù. State in first sentence and refer to twice within the description.  Also ‚Äúhere are your directions to our home where you will stay in a private bedroom‚Ä¶‚Äù
hkkbe18,No_Gas_All_Ass,2021-11-14 02:04:51,2,6,I support this comment fully.
hkkbo5s,No_Gas_All_Ass,2021-11-14 02:08:11,1,23,People who jump to this type of hooker & affair business conclusion reveal the type of context they wish to get off too.
hkkeauq,justamemeguy,2021-11-14 02:40:15,4,11,I think you would get a better response if you shared what you have done or tried or researched. You may or may not have done any leg work yourself  but as someone reading your post and not knowing who you are its a mixture of is this person asking for a silver spoon? Or what exactly does he want to know? This question is too general to answer
hkkpptu,doctorzaius6969,2021-11-14 05:04:52,2,23,Or perhaps people should know what Airbnb is
hkkqh4h,myheadfelloff,2021-11-14 05:14:07,7,10,You don‚Äôt owe either guest anything. It‚Äôs a business. Book it up as well as you can. Long stays are easy to host if you want them.
hkkrgxu,Unlikely-Collar4088,2021-11-14 05:25:46,1,19,I think that a lot of folks havent really grasped that being an AirBnB host means youre running a business out of your home.  Banning people protected by the ADA in your business because you have allergies is as silly as a restaurant saying no seeing eye dogs our chef is allergic or a law firm saying No veteran companion animals our owner has asthma.  &#x200B  The problem is that AirBNB lumps ESAs into the same category as therapy dogs and service dogs.  Until they change that yall are playing with fire trying to ban ESAs.
hkkryrt,Unlikely-Collar4088,2021-11-14 05:31:39,-1,10,I would communicate to the first guest that you have a discounted offer on the table for the days he said hes interested in and see if he wants to beat the offer or withdraw his own.
hkkufr4,YuSmelFani,2021-11-14 06:00:48,-1,10,But then this host risks losing the 4-5 month stay...
hkkurgp,cruzcontrol8765,2021-11-14 06:04:29,0,4,Would you try to rent it in the winter also or would it only be available in summer?
hkl2f3d,airbnb_hosting,2021-11-14 07:22:20,1,23,I have the rhe exact situation in my house.  Its called home sharing and you can categorize your place as an entire guest suite because they have their own enty and bath. Its great. Been doing this for 4 years

hkl4pnj,thatcbcb,2021-11-14 07:42:52,2,11,Realtors in STR heavy areas tend to already know what investors are looking for. Probably the most important thing is to make sure you have a realtor who weeds out the properties that aren‚Äôt zoned for areas that allow STRs but ultimately you should know what the STR regulations are in an area you‚Äôre purchasing in.  Realtors- buyers and sellers agents - are in the business of getting you to hand over your money. They are salespeople who are trying to sell you a property not help you build a business. Just because a realtor says a property CAN book for $x per night doesn‚Äôt mean it will and doesn‚Äôt mean it will consistently or year round just because a realtor says you‚Äôll make a lot of money doesn‚Äôt mean they understand how much Airbnb fees and wear and tear and whatnot cuts into things and how that can vary based on the size of the property your typical guest etc.  Right now my area specifically giant bubble happening on the STRs. A lot of people have a cousin who has a friend or something that has a property here that ‚Äúmakes a bunch of money.‚Äù We‚Äôre watching properties get bought at prices where we know the rental income isn‚Äôt going to be sustainable. The realtors are thrilled because they just made their commission it is not their job to protect people from stupid decisions and when these people unload these properties at a loss in a year or two they‚Äôll make commission again.  This is why it‚Äôs extremely important to do your own research on comparable properties and calculate ROI on potential properties on your own. Let the realtor show you places and do the paperwork get the rental numbers if it‚Äôs already an STR but do your homework and don‚Äôt rely on a realtor to give you all the ins and outs or help you make a sound business decision.
hkl4zn4,Sandvik95,2021-11-14 07:45:18,9,10,Ah you‚Äôve put yourself in a bad situation by implying a promise that you don‚Äôt want to keep.   Learn this lesson: don‚Äôt say yes to a renewal option - say ‚Äúif it‚Äôs AVAILABLE I‚Äôd be glad to renew for a month‚Äù.   Now you simply need to communicate the situation to the first guest and see if he‚Äôd like to commit for February. And that‚Äôs only if you‚Äôre willing to do that passing up the longer rental.   Personally I find opportunity always knocks twice and I figure the place will rent and I‚Äôll be fine. With that in mind I‚Äôd stick to my first offer if guest 1 wants to secure the extra month now but you‚Äôve got to let them know that they don‚Äôt have a free option on renewal that you can‚Äôt hold the dates open for them.
hkl62ly,Paulo117,2021-11-14 07:54:43,2,10,This is a great advice thanks a lot! Yeah I‚Äôve definitely learned the lesson next time I won‚Äôt promise the guest something I can‚Äôt guarantee will be available.
hkl7go1,AdOk8143,2021-11-14 08:06:12,1,4,Generally advice on places with extremely low Winters is to stay away from them. Its not to say you cant make money with a seasonal property just that Airbnb host typically favor stable income over the course of the year over an extreme seasonality market.
hkleyyo,skifans,2021-11-14 09:07:06,0,17,What sort of area are you in? If its somewhere with for example alot of Christmas Markets it could just be general seasonality in bookings in that December is a busy month.
hklfawi,mtvcc,2021-11-14 09:09:39,4,17,You initial bookings often have a discount associated with them. Now that those fell off and things have slowed you need to review your listing.  Maybe need to improve the photos and or description provided. Also you met be priced too high for the area or your area is just dealing with normal seasonality.
hklm0y8,Sandvik95,2021-11-14 09:59:48,16,17,You got filled up for the 4-8 week upcoming block but then bookings will slow down because   1) Often people plan and book for the immediate future  2) travel drops off in January  If you filled quickly for Nov & Dec you likely have a good place that will do fine. Don‚Äôt worry.
hkloqlq,Arizonal0ve,2021-11-14 10:19:11,3,6,Agreed. Personally I feel that any airbnb that does stays over 5 days should have a vacuum and mop and such available so you can clean after yourself.  I stayed in an airbnb last year for 2 weeks and the lady was new to airbnb/longer stays and used to run it as an airbnb so she didn‚Äôt have those but happily provided when I asked luckily.  She also randomly walked in on us so I did have to tell her that wasn‚Äôt appropriate either haha
hklss5x,pip-popawop,2021-11-14 10:47:39,1,17,Our pricing is on par with others in the area but our description could use some help. Thanks for the advice!
hklt14x,pip-popawop,2021-11-14 10:49:21,2,17,Good to know about the January travel thanks for the info. I hope we stay fairly busy but I‚Äôm grateful for any bookings we get.
hklt7pc,pip-popawop,2021-11-14 10:50:36,1,17,We‚Äôre in the Salt Lake area where there‚Äôs a ton of skiing which is why I was expecting to stay busy even if travel slows down in January like u/Sandvik95 was saying.
hklus3j,EnvironmentalVast720,2021-11-14 11:01:30,2,6,Thanks for the feedback! I‚Äôve provided a broom but will add a mop hadn‚Äôt thought of that yet.
hkm0n5t,Knapplebloom,2021-11-14 11:41:05,0,17,yeah lots of seasonality this time of year esp in january. thats considered very slow season for me
hkm624x,herir,2021-11-14 12:16:16,3,17,Perfectly normal. I would focus on making sure you get 5 star reviews now
hkmdz4h,oldman4819,2021-11-14 13:04:43,1,10,So I guess your attitude is in business you could say one thing and do something else as long as you make money. Ive been in business for a long time and my word is my bond and I was pretty successful.
hkmexd7,DivingRightIntoWork,2021-11-14 13:10:30,2,24,Thats what I do - my extra guest fee is 25/night so generally thats the pet fee. Whats your extra guest fee?
hkmf466,DivingRightIntoWork,2021-11-14 13:11:39,1,11,I charge an extra guest fee of 25/night.
hkmfefb,DivingRightIntoWork,2021-11-14 13:13:20,1,17,You can send a pet fee through the resolution center insist that it needs to be paid before the booking begins.
hkmid9o,jaminty317,2021-11-14 13:31:46,8,5,All this information is already built into the stock price.   It will go up if they exceed their predictions (which are high) with the Q1 earnings call  Edit: you downvoted me because you don‚Äôt understand the stock market üòÇ

hkmikex,DivingRightIntoWork,2021-11-14 13:33:01,1,17,I should probably start using this for emotional support dogs - Ive had plenty and they are awfully behaved.. I both have dogs they wont necc get along with and I have a lot of very chewable decor (think deer antlers on the ground) - service animals are supposed to be exceptionally well trained EA animals not so much.  Thanks for the reminder!      I guess I can just start saying that Unfortunately my apartment is not pet friendly to dogs that are not trained as service animals it requires dogs that are extremely disciplined as I have some.. decor choices that are basically dog cat nip.   On the chance its a cat I also have had guests bring cats that have jumped on and broke / knocked over my shelving so....
hkmivea,DivingRightIntoWork,2021-11-14 13:34:54,1,5,do you have a citation for this? Id be curious to see!
hkmj2nz,DivingRightIntoWork,2021-11-14 13:36:06,1,22,Is there a citation for that? But thats a great argument esp if its a cat!    Like home is the least stressful place. But yeah Ill need to keep that in mind ESAs and Service animals cannot be left alone and must be with their owner at all times.
hkmj58t,DivingRightIntoWork,2021-11-14 13:36:32,1,22,I can do this! But my dogs are 4 lbs.
hkmjjaq,DivingRightIntoWork,2021-11-14 13:38:55,1,71,Oh dang I need to borrowsteal this into my pre-drafted replies.
hkmjzlo,DivingRightIntoWork,2021-11-14 13:41:43,1,28,On that note how did you even find insurance? Someone contacted me about switching to them for homeowners insurance and they can even get their head around possibly covering for SRO usage.
hkmk6oa,DivingRightIntoWork,2021-11-14 13:42:59,1,28,Do you know when this dropped? Im guessing more or less at the beginning of this month or even after that?
hkmk7y6,DivingRightIntoWork,2021-11-14 13:43:12,-3,9,Thanks! Not sure when it dropped but looks like its very very recent.
hkmkku4,outis-kaniel,2021-11-14 13:45:26,6,9,It got announced this week
hkmm1tf,Spaceman_Spliff,2021-11-14 13:54:47,1,5,Here it is for service or assistance animals where the host has to accept them even with a no pet policy:   [https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/1869/assistance-animals](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/1869/assistance-animals)  >And given their role in providing service or emotional support assistance animals shouldn‚Äôt be left alone at a listing.  If you allow pets as a host then its mostly up to you to set the rules provided you check your insurance policy. I cant comment on AirBnB insurance as I use a third party but mine definitely has a policy on pets and whether or not they will pay out on damages associated with that.   Also given that assistance animals should be trained to a higher degree than a regular pet I think maintaining the same or more strict guidelines is a sensible and defensible position.
hkmnj4s,jaminty317,2021-11-14 14:04:01,2,9,Basically Monday.   Try escalating your old case again perhaps?
hkmp2oa,IncaThink,2021-11-14 14:13:37,3,13,Since you are a new host: When you review a guest one of the questions is Would you host this person again?. If you click No then that destroys a guests ability to instant book. So it is a bit of a red flag if they cannot instant book.  With that said I have accepted plenty of people who have requested and never had a problem. We have had many hundreds of guests and never had a  serious difficulty.
hkmq31r,IncaThink,2021-11-14 14:19:52,1,10,Tell the current guest that the time to renew has arrived. Let them know where you stand and find out where they stand.  Keep your word but be prepared for others to NOT keep their word. Protect yourself. Get commitments.  But also in business a repeat customer is golden. A bird in the hand and all that.
hkmqtw4,horsegrrl,2021-11-14 14:24:22,1,22,Smaller dogs are definitely more portable. I just think most dogs even normally well behaved ones are more likely to cause damage when they are left in a strange place by themselves.
hkmse23,Enough_Insurance,2021-11-14 14:34:25,2,9,Stop trying to make drop  happen.
hkmsehk,pip-popawop,2021-11-14 14:34:30,1,17,Good to know it‚Äôs normal. I‚Äôm doing everything I can to get the 5 stars. Is there any one specific thing you would recommend I can do? For example the majority of your guests have asked for a hair dryer to be included or most people love it when you do x thing?
hkmujit,herir,2021-11-14 14:48:32,4,17,I wouldn‚Äôt focus on things like hair dryers or others. For one guest who will use it you will have a guest that will destroy it another guest who will annoy you for hours on how to use it and another guest who will steal it. It‚Äôs better to have a clean look than having lots and lots of amenities that will make the place crowded and you have to replace all the time because of theft or breakage   The majority of guests will like these though : - professional cleaning. Not cleaning made by you or your neighbor but by professionals who have cleaned 5 stars h√¥tels before  - always better to underpromise and overdeliver. If you advertise the place like a 5 stars property with amazing amenities but most of them are broken or there‚Äôs something wrong somewhere guests willl be angry and ask for their money back. Better advertise your place like a 4.5 stars property  - overcommunicate. Ask them when they check in and again 24 hours later how‚Äôs everything. Sometimes they are frustrated because they don‚Äôt know how to use your property. Better to ask them if everything‚Äôs ok early rather than discovering a dismal review when they leave

hkn3rjm,FirePits22,2021-11-14 15:48:17,2,15,The rental revenue estimates Ive seen from them are actually pretty conservative. Id be appalled if they showcased someone making $150k/yr and suggested that was typical of a rental.
hkn4cq5,DivingRightIntoWork,2021-11-14 15:52:09,1,15,supposedly their new program airclearance is supposed to better cover pets.
hkn4oe1,CCB0x45,2021-11-14 15:54:15,1,13,Oh got it thanks for letting me know. I didnt realize they lost the ability to instant book.
hkn4oxa,DivingRightIntoWork,2021-11-14 15:54:21,1,15,The rise of people who travel with pets is interesting to put it mildly.  I dont allow them outside of the guest bedroom. I charge 25/night per pet (including cats) thou I should probably stop taking cats.... that said Ive had some people travel with cats where it made sense - like they had 3 days between leases or something like that - but Im pretty sure theres cat kennels at this point and should probably charge closer to what they charge.  Eh looks like boarding a cat isnt even that bad!    https://www.chezmieuxcatkennel.com/rates/
hkn58s5,DivingRightIntoWork,2021-11-14 15:58:02,1,30,What are your minmax temps?
hkn5krb,pip-popawop,2021-11-14 16:00:18,1,17,Excellent advice thank you so much especially about the amenities. I‚Äôll focus on providing just enough and maybe boost the house manual info just in case. Thanks
hkn5nkd,artist_sans_medium,2021-11-14 16:00:48,1,15,Are you upset because you feel they should‚Äôve used that data they have to do a better job forecasting potential income? Or because they asked you even though you‚Äôre already a host and did not detect that fact? Sorry just genuinely curious.
hkn8znf,DivingRightIntoWork,2021-11-14 16:23:44,1,32,This is for aircon right? 74 seems brisk to me but I run cold.
hkn93xe,DivingRightIntoWork,2021-11-14 16:24:34,1,32,Ive come home to my thermostat set to 86 in the winter the guests having long since gone. you dont think theres a reasonable range?
hkn9evb,DivingRightIntoWork,2021-11-14 16:26:43,1,40,You may want to make use of notes? You could also possibly disable the fan switch and just explain it in your listing.
hknbwkk,DivingRightIntoWork,2021-11-14 16:44:04,1,10,I had a guest complain the room was too hot Open a window then they complained it was too cold the window was still open. Anyway. I state the approximate temp my place is kept or that the thermostat goes up to (for private room v whole home listings)
hkndn6c,DivingRightIntoWork,2021-11-14 16:56:19,0,47,Niiice! Id love to see a copy of your rules.
hknfsj2,DivingRightIntoWork,2021-11-14 17:11:59,1,32,My house rules read as follows:   TEMP: In winter the thermostat goes up to around 67/70¬∞F (18/19¬∞C) then will shut itself off so it may get a bit cooler at night. This  is common for the Northeast where energy costs are high and old houses can leak / guests often forget to turn off the thermostat.  In the summer I keep my space cool using ceiling fans and high powered fans. Plan accordingly.   &#x200B  I still get plenty of complaints unfortunately and airbnb isnt very sympathetic to people being unhappy that they ordered licorice flavored nonsense and dont like the taste of licorice if you catch my drift.
hknfxo9,DivingRightIntoWork,2021-11-14 17:13:02,1,32,My guest is having conniptions that it only goes to 70 and will turn it right back on when it drops to 68 even though the house rules state  In winter the thermostat goes up to around 67/70¬∞F (18/19¬∞C) then will shut itself off so it may get a bit cooler at night. and shes from a cold northern city!
hkng3c0,outis-kaniel,2021-11-14 17:14:11,1,15,My thought exactly
hkngllh,DivingRightIntoWork,2021-11-14 17:17:56,1,6,I dont generally mind people who are like I know the listing says it is brisk but it was never above 58 so they mean BRISK or I know they said parking sucks but like dont expect to find parking within 3 miles - they should have said non-existent basically elaborating or making clear what was disclosed in the listing (if it was) - I do think airbnb should strike it if if you say parking sucks and they say parking sucks though Ill admit its more about the stars.  Id happily leave up meh reviews if the stars could go away!
hkngmi7,useles-converter-bot,2021-11-14 17:18:08,1,6,3 miles is the the same distance as 6997.13 replica Bilbo from The Lord of the Rings Sting Swords.
hknguda,DivingRightIntoWork,2021-11-14 17:19:41,1,5,Yes I have different pricing for events than I do for room-hosting.  you may want to also look at peerspace or check out r/PeerspaceHosts ! you can set whatever pricing you want though. For me its usually a little custom and I maintain the right to be on the property.   I have been having a hard time finding out to word that I dont mind people having sex parties at my place but you know dont lie about the guest count.
hkngz5c,DivingRightIntoWork,2021-11-14 17:20:39,1,5,It sounds like the event ban on airbnb hasnt been lifted yet? On the good note I guess its been awhile since Ive read about shooting at airbnb party absolutely nothing this hallowween!
hkni786,IncaThink,2021-11-14 17:29:29,7,13,Keep in mind that a dick- head of a host may have screwed them. Theres at least as many horses asses out there as there are horses as my grandfather would say.  Be kind- and attentive- and almost everyone will be fine.
hknq2ce,CCB0x45,2021-11-14 18:27:11,3,13,Yea I approved them its weird because they have all 5 star reviews seems like someone should need to say why they didnt want them back

hko9ehi,themanofchicago,2021-11-14 20:56:22,2,13,Some examples of 5-star guests we wouldn‚Äôt lingote back: someone who gave a creeper vibe a guest who smoked outside but left our place smelling like smoke from their clothes the guest who had a screaming match on the sidewalk and street at 9 pm and lastly the guest who asked if it was okay to set up a grill in the yard and proceeded to killed a bunch of grass by putting the hot lid down on different areas grass instead of on the sidewalk.  None of them broke any rules nor did they leave the place dirty and they were all good communicators I just don‚Äôt want to host them again.

Do all the maintenance when it comes up and dont expect your guests to jiggle a handle or other. Im always adding improvements and extra touches.  Ask for feedback in your checkout message and listen to it. If 10 guests suggest a blender get one.  Throw blankets and extra pillows.

hkop2i6,themaleshannon,2021-11-14 23:12:02,1,13,It also depends on your settings. You can disallow those without verified identities profile pictures as well as those with bad reviews.   Typically I get requested from those without verified identities and no reviews: i.e. first time Airbnb guests. I want one or the other so I have a message I send asking them to verify their ID it‚Äôs done within an hour and I accept their request.
hkorg7y,H2O_APARTMENT,2021-11-14 23:36:17,1,23,Of course. It is in the property description.
hkorrxn,Bdtvx5788,2021-11-14 23:39:40,-1,7,I think using the app will get you better results.
hkorsox,CCB0x45,2021-11-14 23:39:53,1,13,I have the settings to only allow verified and people with good stars. This person had both actually.
hkorz9m,Bdtvx5788,2021-11-14 23:41:48,2,5,Airbnb stock is a long term play for me. Just buy and hold. If youre looking for arbitrage there are far better options.
hkos5cc,Bdtvx5788,2021-11-14 23:43:35,1,17,A lot of my bookings are last minute. Also the algorithm prioritizes hosts that change the price. This is normal just make sure you have professional photos all or most amenities and you will do just fine.
hkos8ub,Bdtvx5788,2021-11-14 23:44:36,1,4,I would avoid this. There are far better options. Unless you are getting this place for free. Why sign up for the headache?
hkosd8k,Bdtvx5788,2021-11-14 23:45:53,2,11,I have one for you.      Ask your agent is they have hosted on Airbnb before. If so they can leverage their experience to persuade owners that it may be a good idea. Worked for me.
hkoskuv,Bdtvx5788,2021-11-14 23:48:07,2,6,You should be fine with that. Make sure to check up on them ever so often to make sure they are having a good stay at your place.
hkosxzg,Bdtvx5788,2021-11-14 23:51:55,1,12,Havent thought about this. I have a 2 night min on my house. Sounds like you would attract events. Another way to increase views would be to run a cheap ad campaign on Instagram. $30 ad ran for 7 days would definitely get you more views.
hkot81u,No_Gas_All_Ass,2021-11-14 23:54:56,-2,15,Im constantly appalled at Airbnbs bullshit kool aid(Advertising juice)  To sum it down... Its like the difference between what a Big Mac looks like on the TV and what you actually experience when Bon Qui Qui with her ratchet ass nails hands you after youve waited in the drive through for 20 minutes k...   Airbnb comes off like a broke ass crack ho who wont leave you alone and keeps trying to convince you for a quick visit so she can get some more rock. Cmon baby.. I need it.. Just sell your soul to me.. Ill make it real good youll see.   When I see Airbnbs propaganda I know it aint for me as a host. Or you as a Host. Its for investors and partners.   OOOOooo Look a this utopia world. Look at this cute Asian trendy grandma with the beach house... Lol... Look at these listings with all these nick-nacks and bullshit around that most of you would never leave out in your listing because someone would either steal them break them or insert them in their anus. Show me more of the world with Rose colored glasses Airbnb... Shower me with your wokeness.   All to ignore the fact that Airbnb sees you the host as a necessary evil. A means to an end. Just like Sam Walton sees their employees. Just like Jeff sees a driver for amazon.
hkoticf,No_Gas_All_Ass,2021-11-14 23:58:02,-1,15,Riches beyond your imagination...  Look at this cute trendy grandma with an equally cute beach house.  Look at this woke bi racial couple with an awesome niche listing...  This could be you...  Look at this non threatening welcoming black person.  Look at this awesome listing in this awesome place... This could be you...  Sign here and we will deliver strangers to your door who we have barely vetted at all and who we make no effort at all at ensuring they read your specific house rules.

hkotuj9,PraiseGod_BareBone,2021-11-15 00:01:41,3,15,I have seen your attitude before. But I dont understand it.  I make good money with Airbnb.   Do they think of me as a person with feelings?  Of course not. And only an idiot would believe they should.  I use airbnb to make money.  If some other site offers 1% more I switch to them with zero considerations of the feelings of Airbnb officers.  Similarly they with me.  Whats the problem?
hkotve0,No_Gas_All_Ass,2021-11-15 00:01:57,-1,5,downvotes are not real.
hkovse6,No_Gas_All_Ass,2021-11-15 00:22:57,0,15,Yea... You are smart.  My point is Airbnb tricks a lot of people who should not be hosts in to being them by showing them unrealistic options and potential benefits.  (eddy)   lol. You dont know me bruh. You think you know. Which is really what you feel you wanna know. But if you knew anything youd know you dont know.
hkoweho,nvgvup84,2021-11-15 00:30:01,0,7,To clarify I believe OP is attempting to *list* a condo and is wondering what others did during their listing process.
hkoyx46,PraiseGod_BareBone,2021-11-15 00:59:33,2,15,Like I dont really understand what youre saying.  Im smart enough to make a profit from Airbnb but the masses you presume to speak for are too stupid to realize theyre being ripped off?  Therefore you get points for being a voice of the people?   Please make it clear what youre asserting.
hkp0ab4,themanofchicago,2021-11-15 01:16:27,2,7,Chicago host here I‚Äôm also the president of a condo HOA.  Take a look the city‚Äôs STR property exclusion list[Chicago STR exclusion list](https://data.cityofchicago.org/widgets/7bzs-jsyj?mobile_redirect=true) to make sure your building allows STR‚Äôs. Then watch [this video from Department of Business Affairs & Consumer Protection](https://youtu.be/5z_OyqQS7hU) to learn how to register your STR with the city.  Depending on how you plan to rent your place you may need letters of support from your neighbors too.   There are hoops to jump through but we think it‚Äôs worth it. Good luck!
hkp97ph,eddiebork,2021-11-15 03:17:34,2,2,Maybe get in touch with Airbnb I had a weird glitch with something unrelated and tech had to help out.
hkpd8vi,richdrifter,2021-11-15 04:16:11,2,10,Im a nomad who has lived in Airbnbs for 10 years (EU and Africa) and just like your guest I will often book a month and then renew for 2-3 more.   This summer I booked 3 months in a short stay flat (agency not airbnb) and I ended up loving the place. I had decided to book 6 more months.   Before I could tell the agency they had already booked 3 months after me with another tenant. No warning no heads-up no first dibs. I was super pissed (I had no idea it was still being advertised) and I would have gladly booked it immediately if they had simply messaged me.   Everyone who uses Airbnb knows that you cant expect a host to block days for you unless you commit to book them.   But it would be so kind and courteous of you to inform your guest of the pending booking and offer him the option to extend his booking before you essentially book it out from under him.  The Airbnb market is HOT right now (low supply increasing tourism = increasing demand) youll have no problem filling your place either way.
hkpj7vd,Paulo117,2021-11-15 05:37:47,1,10,Yeah I guess you‚Äôre right. Thanks for the advice!
hkpjbwl,eddiebork,2021-11-15 05:39:11,2,9,Lol
hkpkz30,itsUlli,2021-11-15 05:59:08,1,17,Unless you are traveling to Florida. January is prime here with prices up 30% - 50%. Same is true for anyone within a reasonable distance to a ski lift or other winter attractions. Seasonality goes with geographic location and ongoing/current events. Get to know your town/city event calendar and price accordingly in advance. The premium you get to charge for prime days will help cover the low season if you have one. Good luck!

hkqfn93,themaleshannon,2021-11-15 10:15:26,1,13,Did they have small children in their reservation? (Assuming you‚Äôve selected your space isn‚Äôt suitable)  That can make people have to request that would have otherwise been instantly booked.   I‚Äôve also had people send inquiries because they were local. I guess they knew that was a warning flag for most hosts so they explained the reason for their stay as an inquiry instead of instant booking.   That‚Äôs all the possible situations I can think of‚Ä¶
hkqhljb,lytol,2021-11-15 10:28:40,5,12,While a bit snarkier than I might put it same reaction here. You need to focus your messaging and copy. I read the first few paragraphs and still have no idea what you are actually doing plus Im exhausted by all the fluff-speak.

hkqy6m4,troutscockholster,2021-11-15 12:18:26,3,6,You would first need to set up your Airbnb as an LLC with its own business account. You would then need to pay yourself from the business account. This only really solves anything if your personal income is less than your airbnb because you still need to pay taxes on the income you make fixing your Airbnb.
hkqzz0n,FightThePowersThatBe,2021-11-15 12:30:09,2,13,That depends on what you are looking for‚Ä¶do you have multiple airbnbs and what is your budget?  We standardize our sheets with hospitality grade linens because they are cheaper in bulk come with identifying marks sewn in that make it easier to identify size as well as allow for quicker duvet changing with pockets on one side to each inserts and no buttons or zippers.
hkr0k1i,thatcbcb,2021-11-15 12:33:57,1,13,We use brushed microfiber from Target. (BRUSHED being the important word.) All of our properties are mid-priced for our market.  They have held up well and guests seem to like them. And their price point means I don‚Äôt cry when someone inevitably stains them.
hkr0uk1,shazbholla,2021-11-15 12:35:51,1,13,Just a house w. three beds.  Comfort is most important but I know there are sheets that also dry quicker so would be easier and quicker for cleaners.   Thanks for any thoughts.

hkrkmgl,RedSpeedRacerXX,2021-11-15 14:45:47,3,13,I have an Airbnb that we have hosted for a little over 400 stays.   I started with microfiber but have since changed to 100% cotton (though I occasionally use a cotton blend).   I am a very hot sleeper and I realized only a couple years ago that microfiber traps heat and was adding to my misery.  So while I loved the softness of the microfiber sheets they dont work well for people who sleep hot.  If you are not a hot sleeper you may be unaware of this.  I switched over to cotton.  Big difference.  So I switched to cotton as well for the Airbnb.  I use [these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XS36DVR/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1) from Amazon they are fairly priced for cotton and well-reviewed:
hkro7r1,shazbholla,2021-11-15 15:09:04,2,13,Many thanks for the info and link! and yes Im a very hot sleeper and many people I know are as well!
hkrpnus,RedSpeedRacerXX,2021-11-15 15:18:30,1,13,Several of the reviews are from people who use them in their rental businesses. One of the detailed reviews was from someone who had bought over 25 sets and had a substantial rental business.  Her review cinched it for me and I have been happy with the sheets.  One set unraveled just a little bit at the hem after a few washings but I snipped the loose thread and have used the sets now for over a year with no issues at all.  After the softness and coolness of cotton I am never going back to microfiber!
hkrpok9,poloace,2021-11-15 15:18:37,1,17,Do you have a minimum set for number of nights? I noticed my bookings are down now too.   something is definitely up.   In fact I went to search for my listings and all 6 of them don‚Äôt show up unless you scroll under an area where they ask you if your dates are flexible‚Ä¶. But this doesn‚Äôt make sense as my rules and parameters only exist to create a 4 day min and I was searching for a week rental: something is up.   Let me know if you‚Äôve heard anything.
hkrqmo4,shazbholla,2021-11-15 15:24:46,2,13,awesome! I just read that review and ordered a set to check out for myself and to see if it helps w. my hot sleeper issue which has plagued me for years!

I just cant afford to use them for my Airbnb though if I had not treated myself for my birthday last year I would have been happier with the Amazon sheets for sure rather than the very nice microfiber ones I had from Costco.    Thanks for the link to the bamboo blankets.  I have always wondered if bamboo would work for a hot sleeper.

hksr4oz,redgreenapple,2021-11-15 19:44:50,1,17,What happened? Link to the first post?
hksss5a,marglobal,2021-11-15 19:57:03,-3,17,Original post is here. and a lot of people were ridiculous and supported the weird guest. https://www.reddit.com/r/airbnb\_hosts/comments/qoic9e/my\_turn\_to\_get\_blackmailed/hjy5dt9/?context=3
hksv90p,Enough_Insurance,2021-11-15 20:15:08,7,17,OP wanted the guest to pass out Halloween candy
hksvkdx,ParkSloperator,2021-11-15 20:17:25,8,17,Yes they want you to donate your space. No I would not donate your space. Airbnb has billions of dollars. They can pay hosts to do this. I am not heartless either. (I read up on the Airbnb.org platform yesterday so Im almost positive you have to donate your space.) You lose income they feel good about themselves.
hkswq5h,Farrell_Pool_Jack,2021-11-15 20:25:44,2,2,My cleaners are great and also handle light handyman work.  I walked the cleaner through fixing a sliding shower door and fixing a toilet.  I gave them $500 bonus and it was well deserved.
hkswvbj,Maybe_Black_Mesa,2021-11-15 20:26:47,5,2,Before circumstances changed for me (you know that Covid thing) and I started doing my own cleaning I gave my two cleaners a $500 cash bonus each and I would also give them some assorted $50 gift cards from the neighborhood restaurants I have concierge programs with (restaurants would gift them to me at the end of the year as a bonus for the business relationship and I would in turn gift them to my cleaning crew). All told they would get about $700-$800 as a bonus. If I ever start having cleaners again I will do the same. If I can do more I surely will because I love being an Airbnb host but sometimes I really hate cleaning toilets and making beds lol
hksxzlq,Bdtvx5788,2021-11-15 20:34:59,3,17,Yeah there has to be another way. They should get the government to compensate hosts. Hope Im not sounding like an a*hole but that is a pretty big ask. Potential loss of $4000 plus my monthly payment and utilities? Im not running a charity. I wanted to post here to see if there is something I am missing about this.
hkt2vv4,ParkSloperator,2021-11-15 21:11:44,2,17,No you are not missing and yes AirBNB could.....compensate hosts.
hkt2wse,marglobal,2021-11-15 21:11:56,-7,17,No I did want the guest to pass out. Period not candy. hahaha. Candy was not relevant but caught every one‚Äôs eye
hkt39sp,themaleshannon,2021-11-15 21:14:42,1,13,Ok so completely unrelated to your original post - what kind of baby gear do you provide? I‚Äôve been considering a combo play pen/crib/changing table that can be folded and stored out of the way. But I don‚Äôt have any kids so not sure what‚Äôs considered good or ‚Äúenough.‚Äù  Something like this is what I have in mind: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RZQC1T1/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_0510F2XFJMMR6109802Q?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1
hkt4kuc,marglobal,2021-11-15 21:24:40,0,32,well..it all depends how much tolerance you have against negative cash flows. Thinking of tesla. do you think you can cash flow from it for the initial 5 years. basic formula for investment is d/(r-g). you ca. survive with negative cash if you have enough growth.  surprised how ignorant some people are.
hkt4qrl,marglobal,2021-11-15 21:25:56,1,19,I have been doing this with every listings for about half a year. it works well.
hkt7322,curved_D,2021-11-15 21:44:07,12,22,I welcome them with a bed toilet and a shower. My guests love it. I spend $0 per stay. No one has ever complained or mentioned it.   Haha. But in all honesty I think it really depends on the type of listing. If you‚Äôre going for a swankier locale then it makes sense.   I wonder if doing that extra stuff bumps you over into the Schedule C tax category.
hkt7k8t,Sandvik95,2021-11-15 21:47:54,0,15,Noooo! Please don‚Äôt ask him to ‚Äúbe clear with what [he is] asserting‚Äù. It only eggs him on.   Next‚Ä¶

hkta0ia,ParkSloperator,2021-11-15 22:07:40,7,22,lol.... I dont know. We definitely get a lot of upscale guests as evidenced by the priority bag tags on their luggage and we get a TON of grandparents visiting their kids/grandkids in the neighborhood. I feel like my target demographic tbh is wealthier grandparents - just an observation over the last 9 years.  I have spent a lot of time in 5 star hotels and I know my space isnt that but I strive for that level of cleanliness and comfort and the personalized welcome amenity.
hktacqw,bigcrunchcombo1,2021-11-15 22:10:32,1,7,That would make sense but the cleaning fee alone is 200 bucks so it doesnt add up. Probably the other things you mention
hktalpx,CCB0x45,2021-11-15 22:12:39,2,13,I just have a cheap pack and play from amazon a folding high chair and a plastic  baby bath(because my condo doesnt have a bath tub).   &#x200B  I doubt you really need a changing table to be honest I changed my kid on a couch or bed with a towel under him. I think that pack and play you listed is basically what we had but without all the extra bells and whistles. I would just have a pack and play and keep it simple.
hktarra,themaleshannon,2021-11-15 22:14:03,1,13,Awesome I appreciate the info. Thanks!
hktazz4,CeePee1,2021-11-15 22:16:00,8,22,I leave a basket of eggs that we get delivered fresh from the farm (¬£1) and a loaf of specialty fruit bread that is only made in out local bakery (~¬£2.40). I have ice made up in the freezer a bottle of chilled water in the fridge a wide selection of teas and herbal infusions instant and ground coffee hot chocolate and a pint of UHT milk in the kitchen cupboard. I regularly get comments about great amenities and private thanks for the little extras.   I used to get locally produced cheese but it was a lot more expensive and didnt get me any more appreciation so I stick with the cheaper easier to stock option.
hktcgkg,MsTerious1,2021-11-15 22:28:44,4,22,I think as a guest I would love the extra touches youre providing and I wouldnt balk at a $5 per night difference in cost.
hktdhql,Cole1One,2021-11-15 22:37:59,8,17,Airbnb using this as a PR campaign while donating nothing at all really takes the cake.  They came up with a program for hosts to give their spaces for free.  Cost them nothing but they get all of the press.  Disgusting

hktoank,musashi39,2021-11-16 00:25:58,1,20,We write We appreciate it when you remove your shoes next to the front door. This is not mandatory but we do have white carpets (not our idea). In our welcome message. We plan on adding those plastic things that go around your shoes for those that dont want to remove them.  We dont really enforce this rule but think of it more as a thing to point to if we need to charge for carpet cleaning or other damage.
hktpzt8,twitch_delta_blues,2021-11-16 00:45:34,1,8,One option might be hotel surplus. Look for a place that specializes in that. It will of course depend on the density of hotels and resorts in your area. That and Craigslist.
hktq4xp,Fuzzy_mulberry,2021-11-16 00:47:13,2,22,On this note.... I have a fire pit and my cabin and would like to leave smore kits but individually wrapped marshmellows are hard to find and I think it seems wasteful to leave a whole bag for every stay. If I were to leave 3 pretty decorative jars each with graham crackers chocolates and marshmellows in my cabin would it be nice or gross because things arent individually wrapped?  I would also like to leave one with popcorn. I currently leave coffee in a canister instead of individual packets.
hktsrzn,CeePee1,2021-11-16 01:19:08,1,22,Its not an easy call. I have a set of teas that are individually wrapped in paper and I leave a new bag of ground coffee per visit. I take half bags and use them myself. Instant coffee is in a jar and open standard breakfast tea bags are in a jar and I top it up (ensuring older bags go to the top) between guests. I think with things like that theres enough choice between wrapped v jarred and the realisation that boiling water will sterilise your tea bag before its drunk.   We dont have smores or graham crackers over here but I think Id be more hesitant with foodstuffs that are handled even if they are shoved in a fire before you eat them. In my head the surfaces are more of a breeding ground for ickiness as theres a ready food source for whatever bacteria are coming off unwashed fingers. So if you mean you empty the jars between each guest and just provide a starter kit it sounds fine. If youre just topping up between guests you need to be aware of when you put things into the jars so theyre not going off or you dont have old marshmallows under new ones with the chance of going mouldy.
hktufee,macmag782,2021-11-16 01:39:50,6,17,‚ÄúHe Refused to open the door and send candies out to kids while I prepared free candies‚Äù  This is first on your list of facts.
hktv4u3,thatcbcb,2021-11-16 01:48:53,2,32,This isn‚Äôt Tesla this is real estate investing.  You picked a fight with a guest because he didn‚Äôt want to hand out Halloween candy. And your property doesn‚Äôt cash flow. And it‚Äôs everyone else that‚Äôs ignorant? Okay Jan.  OP clearly is looking to make money based on his original post or at least break even not make dubious investments based on *possible* potential return on investment in a seller‚Äôs market.   Congratulations to you for hosting at a loss while the rest of us turn a profit. I‚Äôm glad you think the people actually making money and not trying to force their guests to hand out Halloween candy are the ignorant ones.
hkucy8o,FanyWest23,2021-11-16 05:50:49,3,22,I only provide things that can last from guest to guest like the teas and coffee coffee whitener (powder so j don‚Äôt have to worry about replacing milk all the time) chocolates. Some basic condiments that have a long shelf life mustard/ketchup/relish/hot sauce/soy sauce. With the shampoo/conditioner/body wash I get a lot of mentions of how well stocked the place is. It‚Äôs too much work and un -returned value to include all the things you include but I would be a very happy guest to see them!
hkuf6fm,Specialist-codpiece,2021-11-16 06:15:51,12,20,Have used 2 and both were absolutely awful.  The main thing that lets them down is the cleaners they use  and the fact the the people in charge of your property couldnt give 2 shits about it or the guests.  I will never do it again.  I live far away from my property and have just ended up putting stuff in place for emergencies and I have a reliable cleaner and emergency back up keys in a safe place if the guests lose them.
hkufn3z,Specialist-codpiece,2021-11-16 06:20:48,3,17,No I wouldnt host them for free or if I was paid.  I prefer guests who actually know what airbnb is and how it works personally. Just cos theyre refugees doesnt mean theyre all going to be poor meek and lovely people.
hkug4rj,chwilliaruns,2021-11-16 06:25:57,5,17,Seems like a crazy host and a guest that overreacted to a crazy host.
hkuh7iz,castle_mastle,2021-11-16 06:36:52,7,22,We leave a smores kit for our guests. The marshmallows are cheap enough if you buy on sale in bulk but definitely very wasteful. We are switching off smores for the winter but when we bring them back next spring we are going to package them into smaller bags using a sealing machine. Its not a lot of work and in about an hour we can make enough baggies to cover over all the guests we host for an entire quarter.
hkuikwm,payyourbillstoday,2021-11-16 06:50:23,3,17,Same thing I told my wife when I read that long ass message they sent.
hkukrp2,Bubba_Nosferatu,2021-11-16 07:10:45,2,20,Youd be better served trying to find a professional co-host.   Management companies only understand full time renters who are a completely different type of renter.  There used to be a way to find co-host on the AirBNB site but I havent looked for it in a couple of years.
hkukv17,Jlowery28,2021-11-16 07:11:33,1,22,We leave a couple of local beers in the fridge some fruit and coffee. Get tons of compliments and it‚Äôs only ~$5 of stuff. More wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be better in our case but it depends on the place location & price I suppose.
hkuotq7,cjigga,2021-11-16 07:45:47,1,20,I have a no shoes policy and state it clearly in my listing (and the fine for breaking the rule) in multiple places. I have the rule because I care about this issue and am willing to forego bookings from people who want to wear shoes inside. If you are not willing to be firm and forego bookings I‚Äôd say adjust your mindset and get used to the idea of people wearing shoes. But our listing descriptions and terms seems to mostly filter out people who want to wear shoes.  My automated messages remind of the rule too.  I know some of our guests have worn shoes inside probably to run and grab something quickly. If you‚Äôre a bit of a clean freak like me you can probably tell. But it‚Äôs not been anything that our standard cleaning process can‚Äôt fix or that I had to collect on the fine.   I provide disposable slippers for people to wear indoors and have a bench with shoes racks/tray at the front door for people to sit and change shoes. The layout of our area rugs also provides a way for someone who will wear shoes inside (getting ready to leave and forego something in the bedroom for ex) to mostly stay off the rugs.
hkupasw,glitterbug0927,2021-11-16 07:49:44,1,24,It‚Äôs only $15/night. It seemed like to most logical way to me
hkupk00,DivingRightIntoWork,2021-11-16 07:51:48,1,24,That isnt bad. That said there are pet sitters pet hotels etc. $25 a night for a pet isnt very expensive in contrast to all those options. I wouldnt mind paying $25 extra to travel with my dog but also $15 is fine too. That said theres been plenty of times I just made arrangements because sometimes its also nice to be fit free.
hkuqc00,orangeboxlibrarian,2021-11-16 07:58:03,1,20,We use two small local places in the two communites where our homes are located.  They are in beach communities so a management company is the way things have been done for decades.  Taking care of our places well directly affects them. One weve used one for 25 years.  Honestly our houses are more VRBO places but they seem to understand Airbnb too.  They have quality people on staff to come and fix stuff and they have good relationships with HVAC and remodeling people so we dont have to curate that list.  They will pick up stuff at the post office and wait for deliveries at the house.  We are currently renovating remotely.    One has their own cleaning people who are fabulous the other not so good but are trying to change.  They manage expectations and thus I think our reviews are better.  I can tell when an issue has come up and they mention the management company.    They do walk-throughs and make suggestions to increase rental income and guest satisfaction.   Part of the success is we found companies where our property adds something to their portfolio.  Neither are high-end but they fit in the companies portfolio.
hkurhav,ButchDeal,2021-11-16 08:07:09,1,8,Ikea and other inexpensive furniture will not hold up very long at all with guests.    I suggest getting USED furniture that is in good condition.  shop at thrift stores etc or yard sales or facebook marketplace. You can generally get far better quality for less money and a product that will last for years even with rough use.
hkuvvpg,pip-popawop,2021-11-16 08:41:19,1,17,Yah man sounds weird I‚Äôd look into that. I have a 3 night minimum.
hkuwdsb,YMNY,2021-11-16 08:45:02,2,17,Airbnb figured out a great deal for themselves. They get hosts to donate the accommodations and get all the credit and publicity for ‚Äúhosting‚Äù the refugees for free.   I would consider it if Airbnb paid for the stays at full rates and nothing less especially after screwing the hosts over when the pandemic started.
hkuxhm9,PappyVanWasted,2021-11-16 08:53:06,1,17,It may be a known glitch. Happened to a bunch of us last week. Although yours sounds legit unlike mine which was clearly not refugees.

hkv2b7j,jackanapes8,2021-11-16 09:27:25,3,20,So no ones liked evolve? TurnkeyVR? Gulfcoast Holiday Homes?
hkv3g81,ReadyCarnivore,2021-11-16 09:35:19,1,22,We rent our our home for local uni football games and other events.  We leave local delicacies (sticky buns for grilling local bacon local fruit and milk from a local dairy) and the makings for a full breakfast on top of things we keep for ourselves (fully stocked pantry coffee teas hot chocolate).  Sets us back maybe $30 but seeing as how were 20 minutes from town and if they dont use the stuff we will it seems worth it.  Its generated reviews that state that our house is better stocked than their own and a real value if only for the food provided.  So the extra effort seems worth it.  Sometimes Ill even do homemade baked goods and leave them out.
hkv9aem,amyg2g,2021-11-16 10:14:57,10,20,I love Evolve. My property in the Smoky Mountains was managed for many years by a local property manager. They were doing short term rentals long before Airbnb existed. They took 40% of the income as a management fee.  I switched to Evolve which takes 10% as a management fee and keeps my place booked solid. They took professional photos wrote the listing and keep it listed on Airbnb VRBO [booking.com](https://booking.com) Flipkey and whatever else exists out there. (The vast majority of bookings come through Airbnb.)  I live on the other side of the country so the trickiest part is finding a reliable cleaner/customer contact but Evolve helped me with that too. If you search the web for Evolve reviews you find the majority of complaints are from renters who are angry that Evolve enforces their strict cancellation rules.
hkv9l2q,jackanapes8,2021-11-16 10:16:55,3,20,Oh ok good cause i was about to go with them this spring on our first rental property and everyone in here was complaint vaguely about managers and couldn‚Äôt tell if they were also implying them. Thanks
hkvjqff,DivingRightIntoWork,2021-11-16 11:23:24,1,20,That doesnt seem bad! How are they at balancing being fully booked vs maximally profitable?  I know airbnb is good at seeing that I stay fully booked BeyondPricing is better at seeing that I may not be fully booked but am making more money :p 10 bookings at 175 a night is better money than 20 nights booked at 80 esp since its around 100 per cleaning anyway.
hkvjt91,The_smoking_ghun,2021-11-16 11:23:54,2,20,Have used Evolve for 14 months now they keep the bookings coming in and keep everything organized. Do recommend
hkvjyf0,vagimite2000,2021-11-16 11:24:49,1,5,Those are actually third party bookings and you were right to decline them. It is against TOS to make a third party booking as a guest and as a host you will not be covered for damages if something were to go wrong.  Hosts cant see guests last names and profile pictures until a booking is confirmed supposedly to prevent discrimination. As far as the rest of the guest profile is concerned many dont bother filling in the about me stuff.
hkvkg6t,marglobal,2021-11-16 11:28:01,-1,17,he has absolutely right to refuse. he was not terminated because of this and airbnb blocked him not because of his refusal of candy. isn‚Äôt that clear!

hkvngep,amyg2g,2021-11-16 11:47:26,1,20,That I dont know. I know that their marketing stresses that they want to help you make as much money as possible. I have never personally managed my rental property since I bought it in 2007 and the pricing technology has improved exponentially since then. Evolve sets the rates for individual dates so weeknights cost less than weekends and holidays.  Fall is a big tourist time in the Smoky Mountains because the leaves change colors. Evolve keeps track of supply and demand and competitions prices and sets prices accordingly.

hkvreqb,JL_Westside,2021-11-16 12:12:32,1,20,The equation isn‚Äôt always as simple as ‚Äúwhat is cheaper‚Äù‚Ä¶ it has to do with the amount of time you have available to be a def manager.   Can you make more money self managing? YES.   I‚Äôd you‚Äôre rich‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt make sense to self manage. Your time is worth more than one you pay for a manager to handle everything. Also if you have more than 1-2(or 5-10) homes self managing becomes almost impossible. Hire a professional and concentrate your energy elsewhere.   Vacasa and Turnkey are solid options depending on your market.   Btw Evolve is essentially self managing. They just handle the marketing/yield management. And if you ever want to leave all your reviews/listings on 3rd party sites are theirs to keep.

hkvx5va,FightThePowersThatBe,2021-11-16 12:49:55,2,20,My experiences with property management companies has been awful.  They treat it like a long term rental and don‚Äôt give a fuck about the property.  Never check on properties never make repairs and shave off the top from guests don‚Äôt adjust pricing to maximize the stay nor do they weed out shit guest.  No one will ever care for your property like you do‚Ä¶.remember that.
hkw056a,thatcbcb,2021-11-16 13:09:31,2,32,Here‚Äôs a finance lesson. I‚Äôm making enough money with POSITIVE CASH FLOW to support my family and retire AND my properties have doubled in value in the past two years. Multiple properties. You are admittedly LOSING money on a monthly basis in the hopes that you‚Äôll get your return somewhere down the line. I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs pretty material and relevant. Particularly if someone is asking for advice on how to get return on investment.  But hey I simply follow the basic rules of real estate investing and you‚Äôre apparently building the new Tesla! Obviously you‚Äôre much smarter than me!  Something tells me the OP isn‚Äôt interested in losing money AND trying to force his paying guests to give out candy on Halloween to the point that they leave before their reservation is up. Fantastic business you‚Äôre doing!  Calling people who are turning a profit ignorant isn‚Äôt making you money either but hey you do you! I‚Äôll be hitting that block button so I don‚Äôt have to see your terrible advice anymore. Have a great day!

hkw2pc3,real_heathenly,2021-11-16 13:26:24,2,8,Thank you!
hkw3o2h,NerdClubAllDay,2021-11-16 13:32:46,1,20,I‚Äôm a host and a property manager in my local market here in Atlanta and I advise you to do lots of research on who you pick to manage your property. Ask to speak to current clients and get the scoop from them. All of my clients would recommend me and that speaks for itself. I know that I treat these homes like my own and my work speaks for itself.  If you find a company who wont let you speak to clients isn‚Äôt clear about their terms and wont be super communicative about your property run!

Your place would/could still be great for visiting family who will enjoy Thanksgiving Dinner somewhere else. Maybe your price is too high? (Even if it is you could keep it high for the last minute booker who‚Äôs stuck).   Good luck!
hkw4fiy,kp547,2021-11-16 13:37:49,2,5,Thank you. That‚Äôs helpful!
hkw4ork,hopefaithcourage,2021-11-16 13:39:31,1,10,How does paying the service fee change your tax liability? In either case none of the service fee counts as income for your business. What am I missing?

hkw6nik,prince-of-dweebs,2021-11-16 13:52:35,2,8,Just one guy‚Äôs story but I booked Thanksgiving and Xmas about a month ago.
hkw8cqy,Gumbeaux_,2021-11-16 14:03:43,5,20,if you‚Äôd like to eliminate the key risk I‚Äôd highly recommend spending the couple hundred bucks on a Schlage Encode. You can set up unique codes for each guests that only work for a specified amount of time.   I live 6 hours from my airbnb and when a guest books I set up a code in the app using the last four of their cell that activates 30 minutes before their check in and ends 30 minutes after their check out. it can store 100 codes but i periodically go in and delete old guests. it was one of the best investments i made when setting up our home
hkw945y,MysteriousStaff3388,2021-11-16 14:08:43,1,22,I think this is a brilliant idea. I wouldn‚Äôt think twice. Also ftr I hate individually plastic wrapped anything because of the waste so your idea is doubly clever.
hkw9apt,Fuzzy_mulberry,2021-11-16 14:09:56,3,22,Right the last thing I want to do is create a bunch of single use waste.
hkw9p9y,payyourbillstoday,2021-11-16 14:12:38,0,8,Most likely your price. Lower it a little.
hkwc2sh,hopefaithcourage,2021-11-16 14:28:16,2,10,No need to be snide. Im trying to learn. Right money that doesnt go in your pocket is an expense. So in the case where you charge 100/night and eat 3% of the fee or charge 116/night and eat 15% the guest in both cases pays about the same  and your taxable revenue is 97$. No?
hkwcuw9,OakIsland2015,2021-11-16 14:33:23,2,15,Everybody has a ‚Äúfirst day on the job.‚Äù  Gotta start somewhere.  It is impossible to know everything that will come up between guests and hosts so the best policy is to remember they are a booking and payment platform.  We have to manage our own businesses as help is not readily available.
hkwh3z3,IamtheHuntress,2021-11-16 15:00:51,2,8,I would say not having the things needed for Thanksgiving could be an issue.  I have had Thanksgiving booked for over a month
hkwi5j1,ButchDeal,2021-11-16 15:07:45,9,10,> lowers tax liability  Tax liability is exactly the same.
hkwiksl,ButchDeal,2021-11-16 15:10:32,7,10,The tax liability is exactly the same.   you pay tax on the money you receive from AIRBnB.     You never paid tax on the fee that the guest paid as you never received it.  You do not pay on the higher tax fee you pay to AirBnB either and your price is proportionally higher such that you receive the same amount after the fee is removed thus the same tax.
hkwinpc,ButchDeal,2021-11-16 15:11:05,2,10,exactly.
hkwn7tu,hopefaithcourage,2021-11-16 15:41:10,4,10,lmao yet Im the one he rudely says doesnt understand how expenses work. classic reddit.
hkwn9sr,Hefty-Excitement-239,2021-11-16 15:41:31,7,10,The only way I can imagine the OP is misunderstanding his tax situation is if he is using the paperwork from Airbnb to fill it in.  Like if Airbnb doesnt say it it isnt true...  Regardless I dont think Ive met someone more in need of an accountant.
hkwr4v5,Hefty-Excitement-239,2021-11-16 16:07:22,1,15,Kinda both.  Its a digital company that should know whos who it should also have a more scientific approach to rental data in an area or postcode.  If you were in charge of digitial marketing you should be sacked.
hkws9pf,beaconpropmgmt,2021-11-16 16:15:04,5,8,How about a new temporary title?    Going to Moms for Thanksgiving but dont want to stay there? We have availability NOW.   As a long term host we have learned to avoid most holiday guests since they tend to cause the most issues.  If they book for a week plus they are generally stellar.  You may be dodging a bullet so dont worry too much if its not a big deal to ya.  Id push for those 3 day visiting Thurs- Sun guests to get the ideal folks for your home.  P.S.  Loving your SN.   Its my office door moniker.
hkwwbvf,beaconpropmgmt,2021-11-16 16:42:44,2,5,Going forward...  Dear Guest  Thank you for your interest in our property. Please note that we will ONLY be able to accept requests from the verified guest that will be staying. To avoid being charged for a request that cannot be accommodated at arrival we suggest cancelling your request immediately and then having the staying guest submit their request through the platform.   https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/427/booking-for-friends-and-family
hkx2rly,bmos309,2021-11-16 17:28:39,2,8,Are other listings in your area booked for Thanksgiving? Or is there still a lot of supply? Im in Atlanta and we are finding that many guests are booking much closer to their check-in date since guests concerned about Covid-19 are opting to travel by car instead of flying. When traveling by car guests book accommodations later since they have more flexibility on their travel dates and do not have to purchase plane tickets in advance. We are usually 100% booked for Thanksgiving by now but we are currently only 80% booked.   I think its smart to be upfront that your home is not equipped to host Thanksgiving so your guests know what to expect but make sure you promote what your home IS equipped to do so you can entice guests to book :) For example while our home is not large enough to host a full-on Thanksgiving it is the perfect place to rest and relax in between visits to family.  In order to attract the ideal guest for Thanksgiving I would suggest setting your minimum stay to 3 days and not to lower your price just to get booked. In my experience dropping the price to be below what I normally charge has led to nightmare guests.
hkx3vst,artist_sans_medium,2021-11-16 17:36:43,2,15,As a tech guy I can tell you that once these companies get big the left hand no longer talks to the right. You were probably in the guest-mode of the app not the host-mode and the marketing department that is in charge of displaying that advert and ‚Äúhost analysis‚Äù probably doesn‚Äôt even have access to detect that you are a host let alone access your host data. There might even be privacy issues with it (you might not want your cohost seeing a financial analysis of your property.) All the host data probably locked up in a totally separate department that doesn‚Äôt share data with the marketing dept.  Not excusing airbnb at all it‚Äôs just what happens with big companies and it‚Äôs one of the reasons why the smaller startups can sometimes overtake them once they get bloated and they start being stupid with their features.
hkx5fla,OilSlickRickRubin,2021-11-16 17:47:51,2,8,I booked my Thnaksgiving trip in August.

hkx8f7h,No_Gas_All_Ass,2021-11-16 18:09:43,2,15,Often I inform the support person that their support is unsatisfactory and to close my case immediately.   I then wait for a bit.. maybe make a sammich. Then I call back.   I do this until I get the person who wants to do their job today.
hkx9h22,No_Gas_All_Ass,2021-11-16 18:17:25,0,15,Yea see.. This is all true.   And wouldnt it be nice if they actually stuck to being that instead of presenting themselves as something else and tricking people into getting into business that have no business doing bitness to begin with.   Half the time I scroll and see hosts on here that aint got the proper minerals to bitch slap their guest the moment they step outta line. Most of the hosts on here will take injury after injury because Airbnb told them the world is great and nice and nobody would ever do you wrong in Cheskys world.   Ol Chesky.. This stupid ass dude-bro... stumbled on a way to lead the lambs to the slaughter and make all the monies doing it..

hkxtfps,Hyde4Me,2021-11-16 20:43:49,1,5,Sorry Im just seeing this.  Heres my thoughts for possible issues:   \* Their reservation request didnt meet the minimum night stay   \* They were under 21 and live local (AirBNB thought it was a party - they are prohibiting parties still.)   \* You are not at the top of the search engine optimization.  (Sometimes you have to really zoom in to that specific area of town and tell it to search this area to see more options appear.)
hkxxayy,payyourbillstoday,2021-11-16 21:12:49,0,2,I like airdna it‚Äôs just pricey.
hkxxjil,kp547,2021-11-16 21:14:41,2,8,I just finished setting up my new Airbnb with furniture from all different places. I was in a bit of a rush to get things set up so I tried some local furniture shops first asking what they had in stock and what I could take home now or max in two weeks.... Nothing. They have a 6-8 week order time because of covid and sometimes even longer.   So I ordered mostly online. Here are a few places I like that I ordered from and why.  Wayfair-yes they can be more expensive sometimes but you can also find good deals. I bought a couch chairs and large rug. My shipping was quick and easy. They hired local company to deliver the couch and two guys showed up with the couch and asked where I wanted it. The thing I like best about wayfair is the return policy and discounts if something arrives damaged.   Walmart-online- they actually have almost all the same stuff as other online furniture stores at way better prices. Everything I ordered was shipped right to my door very quickly. I could also return things back to the store. Of course Walmart is also good for all the smaller house hold items as well.   My favourite places to buy stuff is Kijji or Facebook Market Place. You can always score great deals. I have also negotiated most large items be delivered. I bought a bed and a dresser and they were both brought right inside.   I have picked up some other smaller items as well from other stores that didnt offer delivery because I couldnt pass up some great clearance items if I could get them in my SUV.   Smaller items:  I have purchased only my towels and curtains from Ikea. I to am not a fan of cookie cutter Ikea places.   Pillows and sheet sets from Costco(bit expense for the sheets but they are really nice)  AMAZON!!!! It is my absolute favourite place for last minute items that you forgot. I might not be getting the best price but I can buy it as soon as I think of it and know exactly when it will be at my door before I even order it. Saves time running around ten different stores.     Value village or Salvation Army any and all second hand stores. I found a lot of great things here. Lots of glasswear dishes pots and pans decor they have everything.   Oh I should also mention Winners has lots of great stuff but no delivery.   And best of all anything that you have in storage your not using or extras you have at home. I happen to have a brand new kettle and knife block set (Christmas gifts I never opened)   I definitely probably spent more money then I thought I would setting up my Airbnb but for my next one I know where I will be shopping/ordering from right and keep an eye out for great deals to collect items in advance for the next one.
hky3w0s,seniortwat,2021-11-16 22:05:11,1,15,Thinking about possibly getting into airbnb and now I am feeling silly but what *is* the difference
hky4huf,DrDalekFortyTwo,2021-11-16 22:10:09,3,17,What theyre referring to is your previous post about this guest where you discuss their unwillingness to pass out candy on Halloween. No one thinks giving out candy is a big deal they feel it is strange that giving out candy is something youd ask a guest to do. And hold against them when they didnt want to.
hky4ugt,DrDalekFortyTwo,2021-11-16 22:13:07,2,17,Whats not clear is why youd discuss asking the guest to hand out candy if you say that it wasnt relevant to you making him leave early. Absolutely no one thinks Airbnb would support kicking out a guest because they didnt hand out candy at your request. Its a weird detail to include whether relevant to the reason (which was questionable all on its own) you kicked them out.
hky602s,ChristinaWSalemOR,2021-11-16 22:22:56,4,8,Wow! Are you me??? I did exactly the same! Also Homegoods and World Market.
hky8qrl,marglobal,2021-11-16 22:47:38,1,17,I know how people would assume. people would assume i push something too weird to the guest. truth is guest was very uncorporative on every house rule and he declined to do candy is another example of being enemy. he said ‚Äúi‚Äôm not interested in socializing with stupid american kids and i have diabetes‚Äú. Even though there‚Äôs nothing wrong with his refusal but his behavior is weird in the context. plus he had his constant requests. And he had curses like people is low quality. your time isn‚Äôt as precious as mine. etc.  As a host and an experienced one i have a good hunch for weird scammer behavior. it proves to be right. guest imbedded the ‚Äúdiabetes heart disease hyper blood pressure coughing too little towels ‚Äú theme to set up his later 4 figure extortion. People here can‚Äôt see the context so it‚Äôs fine to assume. I was too busy to explain. Tonight I was checked ID when checking out wine at supermarket. And i‚Äôm in my fifties. It made my day so i don‚Äôt mind explaining a little more. Btw when you see airbnb blocks the account every one shall have a good idea who‚Äôs really crazy/wrong. Good luck to every hard working host on airbnb. It‚Äôs worth a fight if you have demanding crazy scamming guests.
hky905h,marglobal,2021-11-16 22:50:02,-1,17,see my other comment and good luck
hkyahfp,troutscockholster,2021-11-16 23:03:52,2,15,Dont feel silly your job isnt to help people with the website. An inquiry is just a way to contact the host and ask question with no obligation to book. A booking request is you submitting payment in order to book the airbnb upon owner approval.
hkyay2d,SnooApples8929,2021-11-16 23:08:16,1,8,I had my house unavailable for Wednesday to Sunday (hoping to get some home improvements done). Once I realized there was almost zero availability in my resort town I jacked up the price to 150% of normal and opened the calendar. Less than 4 hours later a family booked it no clue what their plans were if mine wasn‚Äôt available as almost nothing else is open. However if you want it booked you need to address the issue with it being not set up for Thanksgiving meals.
hkyb1am,seniortwat,2021-11-16 23:09:07,1,15,Thank you! That makes a lot of sense now (:
hkydb5p,Specialist-codpiece,2021-11-16 23:31:22,1,20,Thanks for the recommendation.  Ive considered getting one of these but I wasnt sure if theyre 100% reliable.  So Ill have a look into that.   Do you have any issues running your airbnb from that far away?   I try to do all my maintenance etc when I visit the property  which is once a fortnight.   I am getting a smart thermostat installed next week which will allow me to control the temperature from an app on my phone  so I can turn it down when guests leave.  I have tradesmen in place to attend if anything should go wrong like boiler break down.   But Ive never had an emergency so far thankfully.
hkydgnj,Specialist-codpiece,2021-11-16 23:32:53,1,20,My thoughts exactly
hkyim6a,pupperplanet,2021-11-17 00:27:29,1,13,Not sure if youve found something youre happy with but in case you are still exploring - I work with the founding team at [Claver](https://www.claver.app/business/claver-for-smb). It does digital agreements which has a built-in eSignature tool.     Interestingly when I was trying out the digital nomad work style for a bit I asked my Thai Airbnb host to use Claver to extend my lease. Went very smoothly.     Anyway send me a DM if you are looking for a cheap simple no BS tool for signing digital agreements. I can connect you directly with the right people with answers.
hkylnb1,No_Gas_All_Ass,2021-11-17 01:02:58,1,5,You are being adequately cautious.  I also tend to check the moons phase prior to accepting a booking. Be sure to also consult the star chart on their arrival date too.  Sometimes you get a complete weirdo in your box. They say some dumb shit. Got a weirdo ass name. No Profile.  When that happens youve got to pull out all the stops. Im talking tea leaves Ouija board burn sage smoke the finest OG kush stretch out with the force AND HIT THAT DECLINE BUTTON... Dont look back.

hkyu83w,zulu1239,2021-11-17 02:57:01,0,32,Because from your other posts you are a terrible host and a belligerent asshat.
hkyxuhi,CeePee1,2021-11-17 03:48:08,1,22,Leaving tea and coffee is standard. The local farm delivers eggs in trays of 30 once per week ¬£4 per tray. I take 6 downstairs to the apartment absolutely no skin off my nose and guests like it. The bread is shelf stable for a couple of weeks so I buy a couple at a time when Im in town. Its led to guests asking where they can buy it so Im helping local businesses by buying from them myself and driving additional customers their way.   Why are you so negative about small touches that improve the hospitality experience?
hkz4xog,Callipeartree,2021-11-17 05:24:57,9,21,Get the place ready but don‚Äôt provide access (i.e. don‚Äôt leave the keys until he answers these questions and follows your instructions). Assuming signing the form and providing proof of vaccination are in your listing rules somewhere you can hold firm.   Make sure to let him know on the app. State that he won‚Äôt be able to check in until he complies. If the guest doesn‚Äôt comply with your rules you should theoretically still be paid for the reservation. So it‚Äôs important to have this down in writing just in case the guests disputes.   Or if you really just want nothing to do with this guest and don‚Äôt care about the money call Airbnb and tell them that you are uncomfortable hosting them. Airbnb should cancel no fault to you.
hkz6cz4,Angryceo,2021-11-17 05:42:16,1,10,I eat the service fee but increased Airbnb rates by 12% making my net better.   My host fee says 14% and I‚Äôm booked about 90%.
hkz6zea,RedBanana99,2021-11-17 05:49:27,-2,21,I would contact support the quickes way I have found is to tweet them. Ive done this a dozen times and had a response in 2 hours or under
hkzai2y,castle_mastle,2021-11-17 06:27:46,11,62,Thatd be a no from me. They need to book the night before if they want to come that early. I usually tell them early check-in depends on whether there is a previous guest and how long it takes cleaners to prepare the space. And I will let them know if the cleaners finish early and.if theyre in the area they can check in early. I usually will let them in about 2-3 hours early. A whole 8 hours though is them bring cheap. If they insist I would charge them a fee for early check-in.
hkzanjd,OilSlickRickRubin,2021-11-17 06:29:20,23,62,That is not an early check-in. An early check-in is a couple hours maybe 3 hours before the normal check-in. If they want to check-in at 8am they would need to book the night before or find something to do until an acceptable early check-in time.
hkzbd1x,Unlikely-Collar4088,2021-11-17 06:36:30,3,62,If its available I always offer to let them purchase another night so they can have their check in at 8 am. That is if they buy the night before their check in time is 4 pm the previous day so an 8 am arrival the day after is no problem. Theyre trying to steal an entire day from you by requesting such an early check in time so this is a fair deal.  &#x200B  Full disclosure I never honor early check ins or late check outs and the policy is stated a half dozen times sometimes in all caps in multiple places on my web site my booking site through airbnb and my initial message to a booking. I respect theres plenty of room for different opinions here but to me requesting early check ins and late check outs is stealing like requesting extra miles on your lease or two steaks at your meal.
hkzbiju,thatcbcb,2021-11-17 06:38:00,1,62,Tell them the property will be prepared for a 4pm check in. If they want the property prior to that they‚Äôll need to book the night prior to their current check in day at which point the property will be prepared for them by 4pm on THAT day.  If we don‚Äôt have a same day turnover sometimes our cleaners will let the property sit for a day or two so they aren‚Äôt overworked on a day when there are a lot of same day turnovers. So I can‚Äôt guarantee a property will be ready until check in time for an actual reservation anyway (or until I see that the cleaners have been there.)
hkzbp56,Crystalcelery,2021-11-17 06:39:49,1,62,Yes I thought I can smell little cheap. üòÖ I‚Äôm not sure if this is important. my bnb is located in metropolitan area in US and they are coming from Europe. And it‚Äôs more acceptable there? Lol.

hkzck3w,Unlikely-Collar4088,2021-11-17 06:48:10,6,8,Its important to remember that tools like AirDNA can provide some data and maybe even some insight but at the end of the day theyll never know your business as well as you do.  AirDNA wont be able to tell you how the uniqueness of your property the amenities you offer your interior design skills or the cleanliness of your unit can change what prices you can command all of these are more important imo than comparable units available in your area.  &#x200B  The one thing I do sort of use as a rule of thumb is occupancy rate.  Once you hit an occupancy rate that represents the best balance of work required to money earned I think youll be comfortable with your pricing.  &#x200B  Best of luck!
hkzclgp,flightgirl78,2021-11-17 06:48:32,1,20,What percentage of revenues do you charge? One company that I am thinking of hiring charges 25%. This seems high to me. But they do almost everything.
hkzcrlt,Crystalcelery,2021-11-17 06:50:11,9,62,Yup. That‚Äôs what I would do drive around or go get something to eat. üòã since it‚Äôs like 8 hours yes they shoulda booked the prior day. I texted them that that they could check in 2 as earliest and earlier than that require 30 Bucks. Haha. Not a lot but I think it‚Äôs worth getting the feeling from them. If they say it‚Äôs too much. Maybe I don‚Äôt want them üòÖ
hkzd4i6,Jpruitt10,2021-11-17 06:53:35,2,62,Ask why - I had a couple driving over night for a wedding and wanted to get in early to change and get back out again for the rehearsal and festivities. I had no problem letting them Check-in about 4 hours early. Of course yours is like 8 hrs early so it‚Äôs a little different.
hkzfni0,stevebradss,2021-11-17 07:17:10,6,21,You accepted a reservation.  Now you are asking for personal medical information on your first message.   Keep it to business.  He will show up.  And his medical information is not your business.
hkzhgyf,DrDalekFortyTwo,2021-11-17 07:33:50,2,17,I saw it. Your initial post and this post plus all your comments are not clear and none of this make sense. Good luck back
hkzhvab,HeyUKidsGetOffMyLine,2021-11-17 07:37:13,3,8,Excellent answer.  AirDNA is generic.  Your property is unique.
hkzigzp,NerdClubAllDay,2021-11-17 07:42:19,1,20,I charge 20% of gross. I‚Äôm also a full service property manager with eight years experience as a host myself. I‚Äôm good at what I do and I‚Äôm not willing to take on new clients unless they are comfortable with my price.
hkzikyb,IamtheHuntress,2021-11-17 07:43:14,-1,21,When it comes to covid yes it is.  If he had diabetes thats a nobodys business issue.  Add some municipalities make it a have to kind of thing since this is a public transmitable health crisis.
hkzimea,ButchDeal,2021-11-17 07:43:33,3,62,Just tell the guest how much it will be and that you can send the guest a modification if they would like an early check in.  Then if they agree you can send a change request to add the previous day.
hkzipww,IamtheHuntress,2021-11-17 07:44:21,0,2,Pricelabs had a more accurate market for me and is cheaper.
hkzje9f,payyourbillstoday,2021-11-17 07:49:57,2,21,Most likely he will leave you on read if there is an issue. I had a guy like this about 2 months ago stay at our place with 3 of his buddies. Caught one of his friends urinating on our front lawn (on camera). They also got into some sort of altercation with an Uber driver at 2am outside the house (all on camera). I notified him right away however he never responded back. . He did leave a 5 star review and left the place spotless.
hkzjktd,ParaDescartar123,2021-11-17 07:51:26,6,62,Not acceptable there unless you pay or have some sort of exclusive relationship with host/hotel.   The problem is that they are probably traveling overnight and need to crash or store their stuff while they do first day stuff.   It‚Äôs totally fair to charge them a nominal fee for this extra. They should be prepared to pay for it.   You should frame it properly.   ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt normally allow for this due to the extra work and scheduling we must request from our team. I can check for you and may be able to schedule it but there would be a $x charge for it. If that works I can check team availability.‚Äù  Something like that frames it as it‚Äôs an extra. We can help but it‚Äôs a little extra is it worth it to you.   I know I‚Äôd gladly pay $40 extra to accomplish both the reasons I cited: crash after a long journey or drop all gear and enjoy the day unencumbered.
hkzk5yd,cloudyflowers2,2021-11-17 07:56:13,3,21,It is stated in listing i only accepted vaccinated guests and every guest has to show proof of vax   Surprisingly that was the only thing he complied to
hkzkcaq,wtfie,2021-11-17 07:57:38,2,8,I would check your booking rate (in a desktop browser) -> insights -> views.  Seems like high 2%/low 3% is a decent click/book ratio. Could help you see how many people are actually booking after seeing your listing vs not seeing the listing vs seeing it and deciding on a different place.  Personally our bookings go in waves. Well get a few reservations one week nothing the next.  How is your smart rate set up? Is it prioritizing revenue or occupation? You could look at the difference in pricing when prioritizing one vs the other compare to Airbnbs smart rate and go from there.
hkzm6e5,Comfortable_Entry140,2021-11-17 08:12:14,4,62,If the property is empty the night before then why not?  If theyve just taken an overnight then at least let them store their bags while you make them walk around until check in time
hkzmckd,CLockhart22,2021-11-17 08:13:35,3,62,I would also give yourself a buffer and tell them that if you do get booked they wont be able to access until x time. Otherwise you could lose an entire nights pay to accomodate them if you happen to get a booking for that night. Definitely worth considering that in the equation.  Its a big ask im sure they will understand. Luggage drop off is one thing. But checking in that early... thats alot.   I get where youre coming from. I always try to accomodate but... and I say this because I fall victim to this... dont do it to your detriment. Or in a way that puts you in the losing position if possible. I.e. dont sacrifice a booking to do them a solid. Atleast IMO.
hkzn7u6,Terrible_Objective_5,2021-11-17 08:20:25,2,62,You‚Äôll hear bout that in the review forsure lol
hkzno6p,Terrible_Objective_5,2021-11-17 08:23:56,4,62,Lol even hotels will let you store your bags lol walking around town with two suitcases because you could only get a early flight !
hkzoil0,superduperhosts,2021-11-17 08:30:26,2,62,Tell them they need to book the night before.  EZPZ
hkzpnpt,Angryceo,2021-11-17 08:39:04,5,21,Did they not follow your booking rules/house rules?  if they did not and its an instant booking cancel it.   Also stop being emotional about guests.  This is a business.  calm down have a drink and slow down.  it will be ok.
hkzqfnf,Gumbeaux_,2021-11-17 08:44:46,2,20,It‚Äôs been super reliable so far and the smart thermostat has also been great to keep energy costs down when the home is vacant.  as for issues being so far away: I haven‚Äôt had any yet but I know it‚Äôs a ticking time bomb when something major does go wrong. If you‚Äôre going to manage from a far it‚Äôs imperative you have very reliable cleaners and a handy man you can call to run by and do anything you need. Just yesterday I had a leak in the kitchen sink I needed fixed before a guest arrived so I had to scramble to get my guy there before they checked in. Something I could have fixed in 10 minutes I have to pay for.   But I get to live in the city that I want so the small added stress of being far is worth it. and i‚Äôm close enough i can get in my car and be there in half a day if I need to luckily that hasn‚Äôt happened yet
hkzqofi,cloudyflowers2,2021-11-17 08:46:32,-1,21,Everything was listed pretty clear at time of booking and it‚Äôs simple too. I didn‚Äôt make small talk or ask anything too personal. Btw if we took more than a few hours to respond to a guest they‚Äôll throw a hissy fit.   I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really emotional to the point where i‚Äôm like.. whyyyy isn‚Äôt he texting me.. it‚Äôs more so inconvenient. I just need him to respond with ETA or confirm if he sent the agreement form (or if he had questions he can ask). There are logistics i need to do to plan on which doorman to leave keys with (they work different shifts).   Anyway he is checking in in about 6 hours.. still not a peep. Most human beings would just shoot a message and be like: flight is delayed updated ETA is 2 hours later. Easy as that.   Probably going to call airbnb in 1 hour. If he can‚Äôt be bothered to communicate he can talk to a hotel concierge and they can charge him $8400 for 3 weeks.
hkzr27y,nygibs,2021-11-17 08:49:19,6,62,We charge $25/hr for early check-in and do occasionally have requests to check in this early. At a few hundred dollars its worth it for us so long as we dont have another reservation back to back. We only confirm such availability 3 days ahead of time.
hkzrit3,EarlVanDorn,2021-11-17 08:52:34,2,21,When they dont respond to my in-app messages I call them. Usually works.
hkzsbbl,JelloBrickRoad,2021-11-17 08:58:31,1,62,Use automated messages to send a message after booking that any and all early check-ins (if possible) need to be arranged approved and paid id advance.  When it comes to the day before sorry that window has closed.
hkzt5zq,curved_D,2021-11-17 09:04:36,1,22,Weird.
hkzvj1v,DivingRightIntoWork,2021-11-17 09:21:16,2,62,Youre welcome to book the day before if you need that kind of wiggle time but also some hosts will just accommodate it or otherwise make some sort of special pricing.
hkzvs8f,hopefaithcourage,2021-11-17 09:23:00,3,10,He thinks since AirBNB would charge him 18% its an advantage because hed pay less taxes. Everyone knows making less money is the best way to reduce your tax liability.
hkzwi7u,ChristinaWSalemOR,2021-11-17 09:28:01,1,21,If he doesnt sign your agreement or respond with critical info (COVID vax which he did) then cancel him per you listing rules. Other than that why does he need to contact you?  About 50% of my guests dont reply to messages beyond the original communication unless the need something or have a question.
hkzxiye,Angryceo,2021-11-17 09:34:56,7,21,you seem to think that the guest will care he will just find another airbnb.  Im guessing you are probably not supposed to be renting a condo or an apartment and trying to avoid some issues too it seems.
hkzyiw4,Potential_Dream_6409,2021-11-17 09:41:43,1,3,I havent experienced this personally but in reading all the STR boards Im on this seems to be a common occurrence. The guest just needs to say they have Covid and I would question that they provided proof. Regarding it being a rampant issue I havent had a single guest cancel due to Covid.
hkzyo7p,cloudyflowers2,2021-11-17 09:42:44,-5,21,Actually it‚Äôs my own place so why would you assume that? Before airbnb i did vacation rentals and asked for ID security deposit sign small contract etc.   I also like to have the agreement to vacate form to gauge how difficult a guest can be. If he throws a tantrum at having to sign a simple form confirming he will vacate on said date‚Ä¶ then.. yea no.
hkzzqa5,Angryceo,2021-11-17 09:49:53,3,21,why? because most condos and apartments have door people without the ability to add guests so people walk them through the process for keys etc.  It is simple if they arent responding to your rules then they need to be canceled. Your place your rules.  Or maybe the guy died/got hurt?  Ive had people attempt to respond to the airbnb text thinking they are responding to me before.  Contact airbnb and ask them to reach out.  Might be a little late for that though
hl00xx0,cloudyflowers2,2021-11-17 09:58:00,0,21,There is a guest list I used to add people on there but there was a limited amount of space. My maid has access my brother (who manages the apartment because we bought it together) and then my dog walker. Everytime i needed to add a guest on i‚Äôd have to remove someone then re-add.   But if i knew which doorman was downstairs working i‚Äôd just leave him a note and keys to leave in drawer. If they change shift they hardly relay the message and the keys stay in the drawer while the next doorman fumbles around. They aren‚Äôt always the brightest. Everything i do is due to prior experiences so I know which areas can have hiccups. It‚Äôs not to make things difficult for one or the other.  Edit: Airbnb is in process of cancellation
hl021kp,advokatethis,2021-11-17 10:05:25,1,8,Thank you! Yeah I havent set my prices yet based on it just by looking at similar properties in the area. I was just shocked at the price difference in their recommendations!
hl02s13,IamtheHuntress,2021-11-17 10:10:20,0,3,I have.  They apparently showed proof to airbnb. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è i got another booking for that time at least
hl0324g,advokatethis,2021-11-17 10:12:13,1,8,So my booking rate currently is 1.3%. Maybe my prices are too high?  I am not where to see the revenue vs occupation but I set it to conservative for the rates on the low end. On the other hand airbnb smart pricing is wanting to drop my price way down (from $99 a night to $73). I did not let them do smart pricing since I read on here they tend to undercut hosts. Perhaps since I am new in the interest of getting bookings in the off season I should let them set it for a while?
hl038vv,hopefaithcourage,2021-11-17 10:13:29,2,8,My advice is to not do this. I also had the same thought when I started and researched copywriters. After reviewing the options I realized that these guys just dont know my home and my market. Each AirBNB is a unique snowflake. Theres no way some person who lives in a different state would be able to describe the homes unique locale as good as you. Even if you found someone in the same city they wouldnt know all the unique features of your home. Its specific location amenities etc.. Dont overcomplicate it. Simple listings sell. Look at your neighbors on AirBNB to get some ideas. Tweak and refine it over time.
hl03lww,hopefaithcourage,2021-11-17 10:15:54,5,10,Yes they will have the ability to leave a review. That being said they cant really review the property since they didnt stay there  so if they did leave a review you should be able to get it removed. I have no idea why ABB allows you to review if they canceled before check in time. My guess is because hosts allow early checkins sometimes.
hl047o4,iatek,2021-11-17 10:19:54,1,10,Ok thanks for the info
hl04knw,ParkSloperator,2021-11-17 10:22:15,3,62,You dont want to give up a potential night of revenue to do someone a favor.  Its a business. Just explain to them that in order to guarantee early arrival they need to pay for the previous night. This is standard practice with hotels.
hl04n34,Knapplebloom,2021-11-17 10:22:42,3,10,Yep 100% agreed it is such a weird feature of Airbnb that I really think they should get rid of
hl0b37e,ChavaElChingon1,2021-11-17 11:04:57,2,62,Tell them that that 4pm check-in is to allow the cleaning crew enough time to clean. In the past Ive told guests we cant guarantee an early check in but will let them know when the cleaning crew is done. You can then decide how early youre willing to allow them to come in.
hl0c6sj,nygibs,2021-11-17 11:12:07,0,4,Im not sure but if I had to guess Id say yes. AirDNA seems to be gross rental revenue inclusive of all fees but not necessarily inclusive of taxes. In my experience my gross revenue comes out to be 10-20% higher or so but we also collect and remit taxes ourselves (not a lot of hosts do so) so thats included in our gross. If it wasnt wed be fairly on par with AirDNA or marginally above inclusive of cleaning fees.   Also offhand your cleaning fee seems wildly high by comparison to your other numbers. Like wildly high.  Im in a low cost of living area so take this with a grain of salt but I pay $50 for a two bedroom $100 for a 4-5 bedroom (I am increasing everyone to $125 in 2022 even though theyre not asking). Big cities are maybe $225 where I am paying $100. On average I spend $5000 a year per property on cleaning.
hl0djhs,36in36,2021-11-17 11:20:59,6,21,>I also like to have the agreement to vacate form to gauge how difficult a guest can be.  The guest clearly knows how difficult a host you will be sending them this kind of crap.  People book you host.  Stop with all the drama.
hl0el1c,redgreenapple,2021-11-17 11:27:37,0,4,How do I calculate it if it costs $120 in this area?   I would have to estimate how many bookings but I have no data on that.
hl0fhis,beaconpropmgmt,2021-11-17 11:33:25,2,21,Never cancel on a guest unless youre willing to take the penalty for that cancellation.  If its an Instant Booking you have a little more leeway if they arent responsive.   https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/2022/how-do-penaltyfree-cancellations-work-for-instant-book-hosts   Remember to keep all communication on the app.  Send another message and call.  Dear Guest  If you havent downloaded the AirBnB app yet please do so since that is how we will maintain clear and prompt communication.  I have been trying to reach you without success regarding your upcoming stay and will need to have you complete the neccessary steps promptly to ensure youre able to access the apartment without issue at arrival.  I will be reaching out via phone shortly if I dont hear back within the hour.  Thank you.
hl0grpv,Specialist-codpiece,2021-11-17 11:41:41,-1,62,Any guest that ever requested early check in was a nightmare.  Boundary pushers basically.
hl0gyh0,Specialist-codpiece,2021-11-17 11:42:55,3,62,Well Im in UK and I dont think its acceptable at all and I would be embarrassed to even ask.  Guests who have requested it from me have been the worst guests Ive had.
hl0hcgm,nygibs,2021-11-17 11:45:27,1,4,You call around and ask other cleaners and other hosts - thats really the only way to know for sure.
hl0iaik,glcorso,2021-11-17 11:51:31,0,32,Look up what belligerent means.
hl0idua,Crystalcelery,2021-11-17 11:52:06,1,62,Good to know!

hl0ovfv,cloudyflowers2,2021-11-17 12:34:13,0,21,Sure if you don‚Äôt want to protect your place from squatters
hl0pmsm,36in36,2021-11-17 12:39:07,5,21,All of us want to protect our place from squatters Id imagine less than 1 in 10000 of us send out such a document.  There are legal remedies to squatting that would come into play far before attempting to enforce the document you are having them sign.    Extra crap like this turns people off to the platform which isnt good for any of us.
hl0qo21,Fit_Communication426,2021-11-17 12:45:47,1,62,Bro 8 am check in is like extra extra early check in. If you are able to accommodate just charge triple what ur actual early/late check in is so that way you are okay with the situation
hl0r162,Fit_Communication426,2021-11-17 12:48:09,2,10,Yes exactly  You can technically write a review but the review would go against Airbnb‚Äôs own review policy and guidelines.  After they have written you a review call Airbnb and ask for some help  My tip would be to wait out the entire 14 days first to make sure you don‚Äôt write a review for something you know will go against the review policy
hl0tyft,Enough_Insurance,2021-11-17 13:07:20,2,5,Guest is going to demand FULL refund AND $6000 in emotional damage. Right u/marglobal?

hl0vd2o,Audrin,2021-11-17 13:16:51,4,62,Offer to book the night before. Maybe offer it half price.
hl0xlac,marglobal,2021-11-17 13:31:39,1,5,wrong. he has demanded
hl0ygwq,Enough_Insurance,2021-11-17 13:37:28,2,8,PM me. Ill do it for $600
hl0zcmj,jrossetti,2021-11-17 13:43:18,3,62,I feel like so many of these host responses are just...wrong create a lot of assumptions(always negative mind you) or are often based on how someone personally feels about the audacity of someone asking a short term housing provider standard short term housing provider requests.  Yall doing that need to take your damn feelings out of business decisions like this.    I would be glad to book the night before to you and you will have a guaranteed spot at 8am otherwise you can message me the day prior to see if the ad has been booked to someone else and if not you are welcome to check in early.  If it has been booked check in time starts at 4pm and Ill Airbnb message you if the space is ready sooner.  This puts the ball in their court and accommodates my end of things. At the end of the day I would still not check someone in at 8am as im never up and we check in via appointment only but I would offer 10am and no extra cost as that means my work for the day is done and im not waiting for them until later. My co-hosts very well might do 8am though as one of the two is up at 6am.  If you are a morning person or do remote check in then you dont even have to get up early and you can do 8am.  But its not rude it lets them know its free if no one books but if they want it guaranteed they gotta pay like everyone else.  This almost certainly has nothing to do with being too cheap.   It often has more to do with flight times flight prices (and opting for a red eye instead of a triple cost prime time does not make someone cheap) or just availability as a whole.  This is part and parcel we get these requests a lot from international guests because their flights land in the early AM hours.    Never commit to a yes until the night before though.  Im just honest.  Im not going to give a night for free when theres a chance I can book it to a paying customer.  If someone books it the check in time will be at 4pm if no one books it you can arrive at 8am.  (I also doubt they will be there at 8am.  People who ask for this are often late so if you do appointment check in make sure you bring up if they are not there at 8 for any reason including a long time at customers traffic or whatever that they have to pay you for your time.  We charge $20 an hour for people showing up late and its aggressively enforced on all people we agree to check in early as we are upending our day and system to meet them at their requested time.  We also tell guests this up front.   For good measure we also include the same verbiage that says if WE show up late we will pay the guest for their time.  (we dont bother for a few minutes late or even 15 minutes.)    We  enforce this rule on a case by case basis for all others.
hl0zutx,jolla92126,2021-11-17 13:46:38,6,5,From now on make the door code the last 4 digits of the guests phone number.
hl1070y,jrossetti,2021-11-17 13:48:52,4,62,Sure is early check in.  My last trip to Puerto Rico this year involved a red eye flight that landed at 7am.  YOu could tell hotels get this often because I showed up at 8am to my hotel and they checked me in fully early despite me not having status with them.  8am check in with a 4pm stated time and mariott locations are often notorious for only letting you do this if you pay them those $$$$.  This is the difference between a place enforcing a rule just because its there and accommodating because they are able.  Soho Houses have this as standard policy at ALL of their locations.  Its also their standard policy that if you show up early no matter what if they do not have a room for you within 2 hours that you get a free upgrade on top of it.  This happened to us in Istanbul when we arrived at 10am for a 4pm check in.  The overall point I am making is sure it is more than 3 hours but this is not even remotely unheard of and happens quite a bit.  If its not going to actually make more work for you or super inconvenience you why not?  Because it doesnt fit in a box of what someone thinks an early check in is?  Eww.  Hell weve given a free night to folks who were in chicago but were staying at another airbnb or hotel.  We may want someone to check in sooner as we already have check ins at that time or day and consolidating them is a huge benefit.  In those cases we flat out offer them a day early check in on the house.  Care to take a guess what our 5* rating is on guests who get a free night?   :P  If you can acommodate do it.  If not then dont.  Lets be real if you can check your guests in and be done at 8am and you were gonna be up then anyway its a lot nicer to have that whole day free then to have to wait until that guest does check in.  (lots of variables here but we check in by appointment so we definitely prefer knocking that out earlier if we can).
hl10kv1,jrossetti,2021-11-17 13:51:21,4,62,I think you misplayed this personally. Too many hosts in this sub are misers for $$ or rules lawyers for no real good reason other than thats what the rules are or thats what the contract says.   Real question when are you normally up for the day?  Do you meet your guests for check in or is it remote check in?
hl10rzv,jrossetti,2021-11-17 13:52:40,3,62,I feel like assuming presumptous with this little data is no good.    But your advice about not confirming until the day before is a great way to sell the benefits to them paying for an extra day AND offering them the 8am check in if it doesnt book to someone else.
hl10wcd,jrossetti,2021-11-17 13:53:28,1,62,I am in the third largest city in the united states and its quite common for international guests to arrive during the wee hours.  When youre paying 500-1k less for your flight you go when the flight is and thats a red eye.
hl116s2,jrossetti,2021-11-17 13:55:23,5,62,I showed up at a Mariotte at 8am a few months back in the US and went to the front desk.  I said sorry to ask but our flight just arrived and our check in isnt until 4pm.  What are the odds we can leave our luggage or even get a room right now?  We got fully checked in at 8am no questions asked.  No status with them either. Hilton did it for us a week later and Holiday Inn did the same thing right after that.    (Hilton was 10am at a 4pm and IHG was an 11am check in at a 4pm normally)
hl11at1,jrossetti,2021-11-17 13:56:07,3,62,This is super ridiculous.   From the assumption that these people are nightmares to assuming boundary pushers when the vast majority of folks who ask for this are doing it for no other reason than the timing of their travel and hoping for the best.
hl11nhr,castle_mastle,2021-11-17 13:58:24,2,62,Thats cool but my place isnt a Marriott or Hilton. Every minute someone is in there is a minute of risk Im taking on.
hl11ti4,Farrell_Pool_Jack,2021-11-17 13:59:29,2,5,Agree
hl12h0l,Farrell_Pool_Jack,2021-11-17 14:03:50,1,62,That‚Äôs not an early checkin that‚Äôs an extra day.  Don‚Äôt do it.  If you want to be nice let them in at 2pm. I‚Äôd also tell them if you haven‚Äôt accepted the reservation that I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt give you that early a checkin and you might be happier booking elsewhere.
hl13nh5,ChristinaWSalemOR,2021-11-17 14:11:49,4,62,Id say yes assuming my cleaners were done. They have until 12pm check-in day to finish (check in is 1pm which is already fairly generous). But if the house got cleaned the day before and was vacant and ready to go Id let them have at it. I would never promise it however and it would be a last minute approval.
hl15z1z,wtfie,2021-11-17 14:27:15,2,8,I actually do use Airbnbs smart pricing but I ignore their suggested rates and use my own min based on what Im seeing on airdna/competitors. It does still fluctuate the price even with my manually set minimum more or less in line with Airdna.  I recommend taking a look at your listing and really try to put yourself in the shoes of a guest looking for accommodations in your area including putting dates into the search and see where your listing comes up check out other similar ones etc.   What sets yours apart? would make sure to highlight that in the first line of the description everything else probably wont be looked at. Most bookings are made based on photos so thats really the most important part IMHO.  Youll probably get more bookings once theres 3 reviews and itll display the average star rating.
hl17b2j,jrossetti,2021-11-17 14:36:04,1,62,They aint in Europe anymore.  I wasnt replying to you about your place.  I was replying to you about Europe.  Im a host too lets not pretend theres a functional difference in risk if someone arrives after midnight on a 4pm check in or arrives that morning on a 4pm check in though.  There may be a random outlier person who has an actual legitimate difference in risk but for the vast vast majority of hosts this kind of change to check in time is functionally the same risk wise as any other normal booking.
hl18hmf,castle_mastle,2021-11-17 14:43:58,1,62,Oh I misunderstood. In regards to the risk comment there is absolutely risk every moment someone is on the property. I agree the vast majority of the guests wont change the risk profile but I dont want to find out which guest is which. I let people check in early all the time but an entire day is too much. Aside from risk it interferes with cleaning schedules or last minute things that need to happen like lawn care. As hosts we gain nothing but potential downside.
hl19p9i,advokatethis,2021-11-17 14:52:01,1,8,Thank you for the tips! Yeah I took some really nice pictures so that should give people a good idea. I hope after these first few guests the reviews will continue to be good. I will try your method of turning on smart pricing and see how that goes!
hl1cuv1,beaconpropmgmt,2021-11-17 15:14:03,2,8,Eh Ive written listings for people all over the world.  Many folks dont know how to protect themselves with clear concise descriptive listings and rules. Thats when its vital to reach out to someone with experience and a background in navigating guest expectations Terms and policies.  Its nice to have a copy writer who can walk through to get a good feel for the property but Ive written them with a phone consultation & video walk through of the property and neighborhood.  The good attentive hosts have had success with their listings.
hl1egq7,superduperhosts,2021-11-17 15:24:56,2,21,Call him.  Like on the phone.
hl1fbxs,eveningtrain,2021-11-17 15:30:46,3,62,Yeah but if you called far in advance ahead of your trip and asked for that check in time the hotel would likely tell you they can‚Äôt guarantee it and you‚Äôd just have to come in and ask that morning. They were able to offer you a room that early because it was not occupied the night before. If they were 100% booked it would not have been possible (though most hotels in my experience have a baggage hold for you to leave your luggage and go enjoy yourself in the area while you wait for your room to be ready for early check-in).  That‚Äôs why I like the reply about saying they would have to wait and see and ask again the day before arrival and if they want it guaranteed for them that early book it for the night before.
hl1j4ey,kp547,2021-11-17 15:56:43,1,5,Yes thank you I will definitely do that from now on
hl1kobz,Effective_Variation4,2021-11-17 16:07:24,1,21,Clearly you are not providing enough detail. /s
hl1l81w,DivingRightIntoWork,2021-11-17 16:11:16,2,20,For my listing I allow up to 10 and I say something like If youre looking for a place to crash and youre going to be out and about all day this will do...   I think thats a good way of going about it. Like You can fit this many people in here but yall gonna be cozy and it aint going to be full service/amenities.
hl1oxf9,arcticqueer,2021-11-17 16:37:20,1,20,Thats a great idea. Since most people come up here to get outside Im hoping theyll spend most of their time out there. I assume you havent had any complaints?
hl1p636,DivingRightIntoWork,2021-11-17 16:39:04,3,20,Nope! I think I usually try to emphasize in my conversations before accepting the booking that you know its going to be cozy. Better to be very clear rather than not clear enough
hl1r0z4,Enough_Insurance,2021-11-17 16:52:23,1,8,Whats your going rate?
hl1w7vj,jpnoa,2021-11-17 17:30:06,3,20,12 adults is a lot unless the place is very large. How close are the neighbors? Would the place command a lot less if you limit it to 8 adults?
hl1zye1,orangeboxlibrarian,2021-11-17 17:57:58,4,20,I think nice outdoor dining seating would be a good addition.
hl212k4,sensicalanalogys,2021-11-17 18:06:30,2,8,It‚Äôs hard to compare booking rates between markets.  One of my properties has a 0.67% listing to booking rate over the last year and it‚Äôs been booked at 97% occupancy. However it‚Äôs a very desirable property and gets WAY more views than the avg listing.

hl244z6,arcticqueer,2021-11-17 18:30:14,1,20,Neighbors are somewhere between 50-100 ft. away. House is about 2500 sq. ft. I know 12 people is pushing it for sure maybe Ill drop it to 8. I think the real value is having the fourth bedroom since something like 2/3rds of the rentals up there have 3 or less. A lot of the communities have the same occupancy rule which is 2 per bedroom + 4 additional. If I drop my maximum to 8 someone with 3 bedrooms could advertise that their place sleeps 10. I dont think it would be a death sentences for the listing since it has a lot of other great stuff going for it but that was my thinking on saying that it sleeps 12. I was going to do a queen or king in the first three bedrooms two bunks in the fourth and a futon in the loft.  Im reconsidering though.
hl24b7x,jen-and-tonic-,2021-11-17 18:31:34,2,20,My place can sleep up to 8 legally and our table only seats four. It still books so... I dont think it as big of a problem to travelers as it is to us hosts.
hl24w2r,arcticqueer,2021-11-17 18:36:02,1,20,Definitely going to do that the place has a big deck and patio with lake views.  Thank you!
hl299yc,superduperhosts,2021-11-17 19:09:48,1,20,12 people is 8-10 too many
hl2a4k2,1bug1,2021-11-17 19:16:10,5,10,They could use them after hours be loud swim naked or cause damage. But pools are a popular amenity in the summer and could get you more bookings.
hl2b1xw,chwilliaruns,2021-11-17 19:23:05,2,62,My check in is 4.  I do not typically guarantee an early arrival until the day of.  In this case if the afternoon before it was still available then I would allow them to with no issues.  Why do I care if they come at 8 AM or 4 PM?  I just want them to have a great trip.  Bottom line...if I can accommodate it I would but I usually cannot.
hl2bj5z,arcticqueer,2021-11-17 19:26:45,0,20,Believe me Im with you. I just probably cant get 2-4 people to pay the nightly rate Id like to get.
hl2bo9i,superduperhosts,2021-11-17 19:27:48,2,20,You‚Äôll find out.
hl2bu9p,arcticqueer,2021-11-17 19:29:03,1,20,Thats good to know thank you.  I probably wouldnt sweat it too much as a guest either as long as everyone had some place to sit even if its not all at the same table.
hl2cier,trufus_for_youfus,2021-11-17 19:34:05,2,10,So all in all a good time. Got it.
hl2cy68,beaconpropmgmt,2021-11-17 19:37:18,1,8,Enough to make it worth my while while being reasonable enough to help a new host get started on the road to success.üòâ
hl2d4hf,BorisLtd,2021-11-17 19:38:37,9,10,Swimming naked ‚Äì the horror!
hl2eo0t,gardenofthought,2021-11-17 19:50:13,3,10,The main issue Ive had at my listing with a pool is guests taking white bath towels to the pool. Yes pool towels are provided. Extras are also always available.
hl2gpz6,heybrahbrahh,2021-11-17 20:05:38,1,62,This is how you do it! Make them buy the time.
hl2jkit,Enough_Insurance,2021-11-17 20:26:52,1,8,$500 too low? It has to be worth it with all the time going into investigating and scoping out the area.
hl2k0vz,skyrunner15,2021-11-17 20:30:18,2,1,Ive got a property in Kissimmee too and live full time in NJ - near the Wal-Mart off Vine. DM me if interested in our setup with a local cleaner/local light management co.
hl2lggq,superduperhosts,2021-11-17 20:41:24,-5,10,Besides the obvious liability.....   Well if you can put that to the side the biggest drawback is when a body has been floating awhile they bloat up and could stink.  Neighbors wont care for that.   Blood from drunks slipping and falling could stain the concrete not a good look.  Screaming yelling drunk guests are always a problem.  I could go on and on.
hl2lpvh,real_heathenly,2021-11-17 20:43:25,1,10,Yeah if you could come up with more of the least plausible scenarios that would be GREAT.
hl2tm15,joypeddler,2021-11-17 21:45:27,1,25,the worst. 4 star reviews basically ruin my day maybe even my week. im ashamed to admit it but its true. even more annoying though is the ratings creep. Why *shouldnt* people be able to give 4 star reviews? it would actually be more helpful than rating everything a 5.
hl2vd5k,Bob_12_Pack,2021-11-17 22:00:05,4,3,How long was pizza left in the oven? It would have had to be in there a really long time to attract fruit flies you probably have another source somewhere perhaps actual fruit.
hl2yq21,Callipeartree,2021-11-17 22:29:04,6,20,Set your max at 8 or 10. Twelve is a lot of wear and tear on your property and most certainly will encourage parties. Set your normal rate for up to 4 or 6 guests and then charge extra for each additional person.   So for example $250/base rate for 4 then $25 per person per night with a max of 8 people. That‚Äôs on the conservative side but conservative is a good way to start your STR. If you feel like you can handle more later then by all means give 12 a try.
hl2zc5v,Callipeartree,2021-11-17 22:34:30,11,10,I have a pool and hot tub. So far so good. Guests love it and book specifically for the pool. I monitor the filter remotely and have a pressure cleaner which can stay in the pool 24/7.   Make sure your pool has a security fence with locking gate and get some good STR insurance that cover pool liability.   I have my guests sign a pool liability waiver via Docusign. So I‚Äôd recommend doing something similar.
hl2zgk6,real_heathenly,2021-11-17 22:35:35,5,10,Yes waiver! Good call ty.
hl349re,arcticqueer,2021-11-17 23:20:03,3,20,That makes a lot of sense I think Ill start with 8 for the first year while Im figuring things out and only increase it if there arent any issues with 8.  Thank you!
hl36qly,Specialist-codpiece,2021-11-17 23:44:37,0,62,Well my experience is that theyve all been pushy nightmares
hl3cgg9,the-og-tee,2021-11-18 00:48:41,1,62,i let them know that if no ones booked the night before they can check in that early. and if they want to guarantee they get that check in time theyll have to book the night before themselves. i clean usually after check out so the space is available for the morning.
hl3fntz,ZealousidealGap7,2021-11-18 01:27:57,1,5,Hello Im curious are short term rentals passive rental income? Is that why you used Schedule E instead of Schedule C? I was under the impression that because if youre hands-on then you must be active and therefore must file Schedule C.  I think Im beginning to understand what you meant.
hl3gwb6,JPhase,2021-11-18 01:43:36,-2,18,Both.  Contact a real estate agent specializing in STR‚Äôs and have them recommend a lawyer.
hl3jrg6,Lit-Up,2021-11-18 02:21:02,3,18,What do you want to know? Estate agents are salesmen. They will tell you what you want to hear and sign you up. They dont get in trouble if you break the terms of your lease. Lawyers will tell you the situation although they will most likely tell you that its not 100% legal. Airbnb exists in the legal grey areas or is usually illegal. If your neighbours are cool with what you are doing you will have no problems. The biggest threat to your STR business is your neighbours and not the law.
hl3mcam,jrossetti,2021-11-18 02:56:32,2,10,Its in the help files why they do this.  Been there a long while now too.
hl3mhir,pnegs512,2021-11-18 02:58:39,3,62,Coming from Europe? Probably when their flight gets in
hl3qo9j,thatcbcb,2021-11-18 03:58:43,18,18,If the property is in a city call the city and ask. If it‚Äôs in an unincorporated area call the county and ask.
hl3r2jc,thatcbcb,2021-11-18 04:04:24,3,10,Guests complaining about the pool temperature and noise would be the most obvious potential issues in my opinion.   I am one of those people who hates going to shared pools at hotels because of other people making noise swimming too close/bumping into me in the pool and other people‚Äôs children splashing screaming running around. So the noise factor in my own backyard would make that a downside for me but that‚Äôs just me. If you‚Äôre okay with that noise then that isn‚Äôt a downside for you.
hl3r5e6,thatcbcb,2021-11-18 04:05:29,0,3,Get sticky fly tape to hang up. It‚Äôs horribly ugly but it does the job.
hl3znf7,CaptainObvious,2021-11-18 05:55:24,3,18,Call the local government and ask them directly. Few real estate agents know anything about STR laws and few attorneys do either.
hl403bn,fernallyhere,2021-11-18 06:00:29,8,18,I find local real estate agents in our area do not know enough about short term rentals in terms of regulations management etc to be able to properly advise someone on short term rentals. As others have mentioned they are sales people and they will say what they need to in order close a deal.   The best route is to call the local city and county  government offices and check on their short term regulations. You also want to check with any HOA and their rules for any neighborhood you may be looking into. You could also call a local short term property manager. They will be able to advise you about regulations in your area. I am a short term property manager and we are willing to chat with people and work with real estate agents to educate them on short term rentals. We offer this service regardless of whether a homeowner decides to work with us or not. Lots of short term rentals managers are very helpful and a wealth of knowledge and are willing to chat if you give them a call. Good luck!
hl427q5,WynterRaynne,2021-11-18 06:23:19,2,20,We found great deals on twin over double bunk beds. We are getting our 4 bedroom ready to go as well and felt that these were a good compromise to 2 sets of bunks in each room.
hl434f5,Unlikely-Collar4088,2021-11-18 06:32:35,1,18,^^^ this is the golden advice. Def check with a lawyer if you can afford it and it doesn‚Äôt hurt to talk to a real estate agent AS LONG AS you take everything they say with a grain of salt ‚Äî but your local government is your best resource here.
hl47ak7,Crystalcelery,2021-11-18 07:11:45,1,62,Probably. Now he said he will check in 7:30am.Lol. It‚Äôs ok.
hl47fzf,keithcstone,2021-11-18 07:13:03,1,62,I have allowed but not guaranteed early check-ins quite a few times. Only once was one that early though and he ended up checking in even earlier without approval. Fortunately there was no one in the unit at the time and Id disabled the alarm the night before.  I normally dont accept last minute bookings so I usually know about 24 hours in advance. I inform the guests of this and tell them Ill let them know at that point. Most guests are going to be fine with it as long as youre clear on the odds of being able to accommodate them and the reason for the only 24 hour notice.  That said after my previous experience I probably wouldnt allow one that early without getting the night before booked. I had a fairly early (10:00 am) request but the guy was staying for a month so whos going to quibble over a couple hours.
hl47oe5,pnegs512,2021-11-18 07:15:08,1,62,Id charge like half rate for that check in time but thats just me
hl49612,Crystalcelery,2021-11-18 07:28:15,2,62,Yes. I said I‚Äôd charge extra $30 for that early. My nightly is $85. He says ok. I think everything is wonderful in the world again. üòÖ
hl499oh,ButchDeal,2021-11-18 07:29:07,1,18,Contact a local host club first.   Then you could try town or county Council Health department     You will also need to find out if AirBnB collects and remits local and/or state taxes for the state and or county/city.  Generally sales tax is due to the state with optional additional sales tax to a municipality AND occupancy tax is also due to the county or municipality.  AirBnB sometimes collects and remits one or both of these.   You may have to have it collect others so that you can remit if it is not doing all of them.    You can contact the county treasurer or municipal council on the local tax and look up the state for sales tax.
hl49w4n,believeitifyouneedit,2021-11-18 07:34:32,2,3,Yeah like u/Bob_12_Pack said you may have another source somewhere in that house.  Ive never heard of fruit flies biting anyone so it may be something else. We have biting sand gnats here (Savannah) but only at certain times of the year and only outside. . .   Last year I had a guest here on a long stay leave a ton of half empty wine bottles sitting around. The unit got completely infested with fruit flies. They were even in the fridge! Who knew they could breed in the fridge? Ack. Dealing with the various stages of development of millions of fruit flies was a nightmare. The eggs were in the cracks in the floorboards and under the sink was a hazmat situation. They were in the drain in the kitchen and dishwasher too -- anywhere there is a water and food source.   You can buy fruit fly traps or make your own but if you dont remove ALL of the food sources they will keep breeding.   In your situation I would probably call an exterminator. For one thing it demonstrates you are proactively addressing the situation. And they will certainly have means at their disposal you arent aware of.   Sucks.
hl4eyjf,arcticqueer,2021-11-18 08:16:06,1,20,I was looking at those too! Would you mind sending me where you got yours?
hl4f7uv,ButchDeal,2021-11-18 08:18:08,7,6,It really doesnt matter you need to be declaring the income regardless of the 1099 from AirBnB.
hl4ff2d,Farrell_Pool_Jack,2021-11-18 08:19:39,0,6,I report all earnings but file separately from my wife that‚Äôs why I need to know when it starts.
hl4fwna,WynterRaynne,2021-11-18 08:23:25,2,20,I should have been more clear sorry. We got them on Craigslist which is where the good deal part comes in. We only bought the higher end ones we saw and we ended up paying a couple hundred or so for each one. We were hoping that the double on the bottom with a great mattress might be a little more appealing if an adult ends up with that room.
hl4h1ms,bbbh1409,2021-11-18 08:32:05,1,10,They allow this because guests can sometimes show up and have an issue with the property or neighborhood and cancel without checking in.  Unfortunately the review form doesnt allow for dynamic questions/review details.  Some of these reviews would be helpful but should not count toward the overall score so that other guests would know of issues like road work out front construction or abandoned buildings next door issues with public transportation in the area (like a closed subway stop) a broken elevator power outage etc.  None of which are in the control of the host but could be important information for other guests - especially if there are multiple complaints about the same issue that results in guests not showing up to check in.
hl4jl8g,caem123,2021-11-18 08:50:34,1,18,I rarely find a real estate agent knowledgeable about STR laws.  Many times they have wrong information or just a plain disdain for anything STR related.
hl4ng36,DegaussedMixtape,2021-11-18 09:17:58,2,18,This is the most succinct answer.  We ended up getting the best information from the zoning department with our county. If you are in a major metropolitan you would likely have to talk to the zoning department with the city instead.
hl4ou2x,flightgirl78,2021-11-18 09:27:37,1,20,The person gunning for my business wants to charge 25%. My friends say it‚Äôs wrong to nickel and dime her by negotiating a lower percentage but 25% seems really high when I‚Äôm shouldering all of the risk.
hl4pphm,NerdClubAllDay,2021-11-18 09:33:36,1,20,What market are you in? Is this your first short term rental? Rates vary WIDELY by market. I‚Äôll also would not take on a client who was trying to get me to lower my rate. The amount of work that it takes to set up and run a short term rental is a lot. If the person that you were considering working with doesn‚Äôt seem trustworthy you should just not work with them rather than try to negotiate a lower rate. I would not personally negotiate a lower rate for anyone.
hl4ub4w,chopsui101,2021-11-18 10:04:21,1,18,lol...your own research and all the things you listed.....i talked pretty much everyone none of them knew anything about it.....
hl4wtf6,ChristinaWSalemOR,2021-11-18 10:21:01,1,18,Get on the google (or search engine of choice) and type STR rules \*insert city/county and state\*  Municipalities have notoriously sloppy and disorganized websites so you may need to call/email someone. That is THE BEST RESOURCE. Find the person who administrates the STR program (land use planning dept permits etc) and ask all the questions.   Your agent should be finding out specific HOA rules for everything she shows you.
hl4x6kw,Comfortable_Entry140,2021-11-18 10:23:25,2,62,Thats because you are a decent person. Like you say who cares how early they get there  it creates no extra work for the host at all.
hl4ywz1,jrossetti,2021-11-18 10:34:56,1,10,This isnt at all accurate as a blanket statement.   Guests are allowed to review hosts but are only to negative or lower stars for things we can validly review.  So I can review a host on communication for sure and others based on what happened.
hl565i9,AustynCunningham,2021-11-18 11:22:13,2,20,Personally I have found it doesn‚Äôt matter that much. At my house in town (2bed 1bath) I have max occupancy of 6 people (3beds) my dining room seats 4 people my living room has a couch and love seat so very squishy to try and fit 6 people..  Lake house rental (5bedrooms with 9 beds total) max occupancy of 12 people dining room table seats 6 4 barstools at the island. Living room has 2 couches outdoor dining can seat up to 8.. usually 10-12 people in every booking sure they can‚Äôt all sit and eat in the same room but nobody has seemed to care. 5-star rated at $550+/night. Just make sure you have comfy beds for your maximum occupancy and pics of every room so they know what to expect..
hl57921,chinaisasshole,2021-11-18 11:29:21,1,18,Go on Airbnb look up properties in the area.  Some will be hosted by some preoperty management companies.  Call said company and tell them you are buying a house in the area and are looking for property managers.  ‚ÄúInterview‚Äù them and get all your answers.  It‚Äôs what I did.
hl5bz66,ButchDeal,2021-11-18 11:59:51,15,10,It depends on how accurate your listing is and the temperature of the support techs coffee.
hl5c7j9,ExpensiveAd4496,2021-11-18 12:01:20,1,6,Freelancer for more than 30 years here. You‚Äôd be shocked how many companies put these out late. I‚Äôd report as though they issued it not just the amount which of course you‚Äôre already doing but also the person it will eventually go to.
hl5eyrd,marglobal,2021-11-18 12:19:20,0,10,i had a similar scenario  answer is no. airbnb didn‚Äôt take down the review
hl5fuzx,36in36,2021-11-18 12:25:06,2,10,Its unlikely.  Depends a bit how they worded the complaint about the noise.  You could argue that you are not in control of noises outside the unit (even if it is you making the noise).
hl5iay1,36in36,2021-11-18 12:41:07,2,6,Youre not getting a straight answer because your question is too broad.  Airbnb sends out different types of 1099s (1099-NEC 1099-K) depending on how you earned the money.  The limits at least prior to this year have differed based on service provider ($600 limit) or host ($20000 or 200 visits).
hl5la7x,skyrunner15,2021-11-18 13:00:37,12,53,Oh I would have remotely locked the door and cancelled this one. Sounds like a total bitch.
hl5m9j6,Automatic_Lemon1069,2021-11-18 13:07:13,5,53,My co-host was furious and didnt even want to check her in. Shes the one who insisted on lodging it with Airbnb which said that they would tell her that she does have to follow the house rule.   Weve only had one prior guest insist on not using Airbnb messenger but they told us that in advance and we simply got Airbnb to cancel their reservation. This time the guest just thought shed get away with it and was very pissy about it.
hl5me7v,Hefty-Excitement-239,2021-11-18 13:08:05,1,15,Yes.  I made an edit to my OP to answer this.  As I am a reference point on the junction of Possible Vs legal I have some insight to this stuff.  Thank you for your co.ment and I agree.
hl5mixr,skyrunner15,2021-11-18 13:08:58,5,53,We had someone refuse to use Airbnb messenger unplugged our network gear and it took a police threat to get them to comply. It was for religious reasons and the same crew asked us if our electronic lock had a workaround. Needless they complied and left a negative review later that we expected :)
hl5mk5k,Enough_Insurance,2021-11-18 13:09:11,40,53,>would be easier for us and for your rating if you would just let me in.  Wow. I would not have let her in for extortion told her to cancel and immediately contact Airbnb for breach of TOC.  &#x200B  That message alone is enough to get the review removed even if she did write a review.
hl5nda2,jrossetti,2021-11-18 13:14:34,1,10,Did you check the box marking it as an attached suite?
hl5nplr,seattle_architect,2021-11-18 13:16:53,-10,53,Some of my guests don‚Äôt use Airbnb app to communicate.  If you are in hospitality business you need creatively to accommodate communication method. You got upset and your guest got angry and result is negative reviews. I usually send the same message to guest text and Airbnb. You can‚Äôt force people to use app.
hl5p3z5,Automatic_Lemon1069,2021-11-18 13:26:08,16,53,Actually I dont. Im entitled to have house rules and if a guest doesnt like them or they dont work for their situation they can simply book elsewhere. Its no different from having a policy against pets. You dont have to accommodate every guest whim.   Theres always one of these annoying the guest is always right even if theyre clearly wrong comments in these threads. It feels like trolling frankly. A guest could burn my house down and somebody would chime in yammering about how I should have had commercial fire sprinklers.
hl5pd5y,Automatic_Lemon1069,2021-11-18 13:27:48,6,53,Im hoping so but it may depend on what they write. If shes clever she wont even mention the messaging issue perhaps make some other things up that I cant prove are false. I definitely dont trust her.

hl5rvfq,IncaThink,2021-11-18 13:44:14,11,53,If you treat the customer like a king they quickly become a tyrant. It is our place of business and it will be a better business if we make and enforce rules.  Some people are just unreasonable. Absolute refusal to communicate through the app is unreasonable. A threat to leave a bad review BEFORE THEY EVEN ENTER THE PREMISES is a pretty big red flag.
hl5s3w0,Automatic_Lemon1069,2021-11-18 13:45:48,8,53,I didnt get pissed or my panties in a bunch over her texting. I just politely reminded her to communicate through Airbnb messenger (which you can also do through a web browser not just the app) as this was a house rule. She then contacted Airbnb lied about not having check-in instructions and started threatening a bad review. She then argued the issue of my house rule with me at length during check-in to the point that it made me uncomfortable.  I really hope she does write the review youre describing though because I can get that pulled. You cant downrate a host for having legitimate house rules.
hl5sdk7,Automatic_Lemon1069,2021-11-18 13:47:35,2,53,So what? You dont think hosts are entitled to have house rules? You prohibit dogs and somebody shows up with one anyway and then its unreasonable for you to complain to Airbnb if theyre argumentative about it and threatening a poor review?
hl5t0mf,IncaThink,2021-11-18 13:51:43,2,10,There are plenty of downsides. Aside from the liability anything extra really gives people something extra to complain about. Ive said it here before- When we stopped providing breakfast complaints about breakfast went away.   However since the pool and hot tub are there if you dont allow access you should expect a never ending stream of complaints about not allowing access. Which sounds like a bummer.  Adjust your prices accordingly allow access and see how it goes. Good luck
hl5ub49,rfgrunt,2021-11-18 14:00:07,1,18,Find the Facebook group in your area for hosts and ask for recommendations. Assuming you live in an urban area you‚Äôll have one.  Otherwise look at the gov committee that monitors STRs and see who regularly attends or sits as a citizen. There‚Äôs typically a lawyer.  Finally see if there have been any high publicity prosecutions and see who the lawyer who represents the defendants.   Generally speaking the attorneys that specialize are tenant law attorneys who represent landlords in evictions.
hl5uo2l,IncaThink,2021-11-18 14:02:26,2,62,Even if it looks like the night before will be empty our booking window closes at 7pm and (of course) Im hoping someone will book even if we are empty at 6pm. And hey it happens.  So I never promise an early booking. Not even if a current guest tells me they are leaving early. After all the room belongs to them until 11am and if their plans change I am in no position to make them leave before then.  So I always under promise and (if possible) over deliver. I would say something like Ill do my best but 8am is very early so its doubtful. Please use paid luggage storage at (X location).  Then at 7pm the night before if the room is empty send them the good news. In which case I wouldnt charge them extra as getting done working early for me is always better.
hl5uyrv,ZealousidealGap7,2021-11-18 14:04:22,1,5,Hi again. I wanted to follow up with your other comment about  >Unless you have an LLC just claim as a sole proprietorship and use your SSN.  Then your other comment said   >As someone who‚Äôs done their own schedule e for their Airbnb for 8 years now I‚Äôll tell you it‚Äôs pretty easy once you have a system down.  I was researching some more and noticed some contradictory information.

hl5y1tw,Automatic_Lemon1069,2021-11-18 14:24:40,6,53,Youre not showing good reading comprehension skills here. I was never hostile and I never penalized them. I just politely repeated on my house rule and insisted she use Airbnb messenger in the future. She then became threatening and argumentative. Youre just mischaracterizing what happened to suit this ridiculous argument if yours.  Airbnb definitely encourages all communications to take place through their platform. They only strictly require it before booking but they do advise that they cant directly review off-platform messages. And they do allow hosts to require that all communications (aside from emergencies)  be through the platform.  The dog analogy is apt. Some people just dont want to allow pets because they just dont like them. They dont need to explain themselves or provide some health or safety explanation. As Ive explained I have good reason to want communications to be limited to the Airbnb messenger system but regardless I dont need to justify not allowing people to text about routine issues anymore than another host needs to explain themselves for not allowing pets or having capacity restrictions or not providing a certain amenity.   You seem like a pretty inhospitable person. Maybe you should take your own advice.
hl5yg1b,Automatic_Lemon1069,2021-11-18 14:27:15,2,53,Yeah but of course some commenters here dont think hosts should he able to create rules unless theyre rules that THEY think are reasonable. I have no idea why a rule that all communications should he through Airbnb would be considered unreasonable anyway but here we are.
hl5z49s,WhyDozTheKniferKnife,2021-11-18 14:31:41,-8,53,Go to photoshop requests and have them make some racist and safety threats from the persons WhatsApp submit it to Airbnb and get all this shit removed  Don‚Äôt contact Airbnb to get things removed until you have falsified or legit threats and or Racist remarks. That‚Äôs the corner we‚Äôre painted in and that‚Äôs how it works since they want to believe we live in a one-size-fits-all world  I also leave a one star review for any guest that I am not sure beyond a shadow of a doubt will leave 5 stars I will claim they smoked and shat on the floor but not damage. Again that‚Äôs the way Airbnb made us do things now  Also in house rules write C19 neg tst req inconspicuously written to get cancellations written off of your record as well as have falsified plumbing and electrical issues with your town/building on hand to get legit cancellations   This is what they wanted.
hl60497,monkeykicker,2021-11-18 14:38:14,2,53,I use Whats App to send a message on the morning of arrival giving the keybox code & WiFi details. Its amazing how many guests have previously been given these details but choose to ignore them.  After that I only respond to contact through the app. Im afraid that youve set a precedent by texting back. Id be inclined to ignore any further texts  & hopefully any further questions will be via Air BNB.
hl60bc3,pacman098706,2021-11-18 14:39:32,8,53,I only communicate through airbnb messenger. I only respond to airbnb messages. Ive had zero guest not communicate through airbnb. Yes you can force people to use airbnb to communicate.
hl62i7d,seattle_architect,2021-11-18 14:53:58,-9,53,Host should draw a line but in your situation it was stupid to create hostile environment from the beginning. You have more to loose.
hl6344s,WolfDen06,2021-11-18 14:58:01,4,53,Yes you can

hl65vvr,Automatic_Lemon1069,2021-11-18 15:16:34,6,53,I didnt create a hostile environment by merely repeating on my house rules. Youre victim-blaming and reversing what actually happened and I dont appreciate it.
hl66z22,jrossetti,2021-11-18 15:23:51,1,10,Literally the first three questions youre asked when you create a new listing is where its at!  Choose secondary unit.  Then check guest suite.  Then entire place.
hl6afks,Automatic_Lemon1069,2021-11-18 15:47:01,2,53,I was replying just to make sure Id get her checked in (I cant offer self-check-in). She had been contacting me via messenger before and had never declared previously that she just wasnt going to download the app.
hl6bqaj,thatcbcb,2021-11-18 15:55:44,3,53,This. I would have been on the phone with Airbnb immediately.
hl6c3jm,jrossetti,2021-11-18 15:58:09,1,62,I mean. I said the same thing so Im not sure we are disagreeing at all.
hl6c9rt,thatcbcb,2021-11-18 15:59:17,4,53,The Airbnb website literally says ‚ÄúYour space your rules.‚Äù So you can make all the rules you want including where you‚Äôre willing to communicate.

hl6gmre,bturnip,2021-11-18 16:29:26,9,53,Simple answer is that when it is in the Airbnb app there is no he-said-she-said when it comes to issue resolution.  No brainer for the hosts.
hl6gmuo,heybrahbrahh,2021-11-18 16:29:27,2,18,I dont understand why this is getting downvoted. Contact the city for local laws and contact a RE agent for a good recommendation for RE lawyer for state laws.

Airbnb only wants us in the app to keep host and guests afraid of each other so they keep future bookings Treat your guests like adults and the review will show it
hl6l2es,rfyoung,2021-11-18 17:00:45,-2,10,Yeah its considered the entire place of the guest suite
hl6l68r,rfyoung,2021-11-18 17:01:32,1,10,I think they were mad about it not being an actual apartment more than anything? Noise is going to travel in any attached room I think

hl6td84,WhyDozTheKniferKnife,2021-11-18 18:01:53,1,53,You may be right some of it sounds ridiculous and might not be needed.  The problem is that just one 1 star review will destroy OPs listing forever especially in a competitive area. The algorithm simply will put her at the bottom of the list until there are literally no other listings available or someone with two one star reviews is the only other option. There are a lot of attempts to understand the algorithm and no one knows but we do know certain things.  For example you might notice that if you get one inquiry you get many at the same time even a declined request will ghost a listing for months almost as bad as a cancellation but not quite.  If I don‚Äôt like the way the guest sounds I make them withdraw the request or I‚Äôm forced to call Airbnb and have them Withdraw it manually for the C19 reason or plumbing etc.   It wasn‚Äôt always like this it used to be a reply was enough and if I didn‚Äôt accept in 24 hours  the request expired without punitive effects to the listing now I‚Äôm forced to determine the fitness of the guest within 24 hours or decline and ruin the listing or accept whoever the hell it is even if they have no reviews and is a group of six teenagers looking to use the entire home as a toilet and move on.  I think we all know now that the platform protects guests at the expense of the hosts now.  So now this is what is needed
hl6xer5,heybrahbrahh,2021-11-18 18:32:40,0,4,Try cold calling and asking if they allow subleasing - maybe you can offer them more per month to make the deal more enticing. You can also search airbnb find pockets of apartments that look the same and try to find out the complex name.

We had told her to use Airbnb messenger and she didnt even download the app. She gave no reasons for why she couldnt use it.   Why is it crazy to simply tell somebody to obey a house rule? The only thing crazy is this bizarre sense of entitlement.
hl70sai,Automatic_Lemon1069,2021-11-18 18:58:40,6,53,Perhaps but Id rather quit Airbnb than be a slave to it anyway. As things are I have an average 4.9 review and am a Superhost. I accomplish that in part by being up front about my expectations and not bending rules that Ive implemented to make Airbnb manageable for me. If somebody doesnt understand that I dont want them as a guest anyway.
hl71ank,skyharborrunway,2021-11-18 19:02:37,1,62,Agreed. I have made one exception where I allowed the guest to check out 7 hours later and only charged a specific amount - opposed to them having to book two nights entirely. They loved the option.   I only did this because the odds of that second night getting booked were slim/last minute and it also saved me from having to clean/prep the room if a new guest were to book.

It takes some enormous gall for you to turn this around on me.   You dont get to dictate to me what I should and shouldnt care about. I have another professional job and I cant have my phone gummed up with random phone numbers texting me. I also want the resolution process to work smoothly with Airbnb for guests to be identified without entering them as contacts and for my co-host to receive all communications simultaneously. Allowing people to call and text me personally as a matter of course is not how I want to run my listings.  But ultimately I dont even owe you that explanation and your absurd histrionics about how its insane for people to want to restrict Airbnb communications to Airbnb messenger is simply projection for your own fixations. Youre acting bizarrely unreasonable about this.   I wasnt jacking anyone around. The rule was in the house rules when the guest booked and it was repeated to her 36 hours before she arrived. Yet when she just ignores that rule and threatens and berates me you incredibly call *me* an asshole and a jerk. Your moral compass is so skewed I dont think anything out of your foul mouth would shock me. Go crawl back under whatever rock you came from.

hl7aa5c,EssentialTwerker2020,2021-11-18 20:12:00,3,53,Good luck.  I had a nightmare guest (another host)  that specifically told me via the app that although there were a lot of great things about my place if I didnt play nice about her breaking multiple rules then she would air a list of complaints. She was in my place for less than 12 hours.  I was on the phone with AirBnB through her whole check out process and they even escalated it to a manager while on the phone then we got disconnected as soon as I let them know she was driving away.  No follow up despite me reaching out multiple times and she gave me straight 1s across the board.  AirBnB refused to pull the review. Her complaints were that the check out time was too early (11am she missed check out and a gratuitous extended check out so I finally had to knock on the door turns out she wasnt there but out hiking she left 2 hrs late) and that we took pictures of her (she brought a dog without alerting me) and that we upset her guest by knocking (she registered as one person) and that I didnt like her name (she booked under another name) and that she couldnt find my place (but also admitted that her phone died on the way so she couldnt access gps nor photo instructions for check in). Soooooo best wishes!
hl7c6tp,FanyWest23,2021-11-18 20:26:20,5,53,Nope I had a review pulled because they texted me (outside of AirBnb) that they would give me a bad review if I did not refund them money.  That proved extortion despite their 3 star review not saying anything bad in itself.  I did have to take it to Twitter to have a competent person look at the evidence (I screenshot the text) but it was removed eventually.
hl7cf2y,FanyWest23,2021-11-18 20:28:03,4,53,Take it to Twitter they will get someone more competent to look at the issue. I created a Twitter account just for this issue and it was finally taken care of.
hl7gm3d,keithcstone,2021-11-18 20:59:58,2,18,Someone with money on the table (i.e. Real Estate Agents Brokers etc) should be the LAST people to talk to. Their job is not to know the STR rules it is to sell or lease property. Contact the local authority in question be it city county etc and double check there isnt a neighborhood authority involved. A local lawyer may or may not know that but if you specify what youre looking for they should either say thats not what we do say someone else does that or blow a huge smoke cloud up your butt cheeks. My recommendation would be to inquire yourself with the local authorities then obtain an attorney telling them what you know and have them research any covenants or other zoning issues for surprises. That said you should be aware there are a LOT of localities where there is an anti-STR movement afoot. Much of it is parking (and party) related so prepared so that vibe.

hl7vqb0,Automatic_Lemon1069,2021-11-18 23:04:14,2,53,Ive heard its gotten better more recently but that kind of nonsense is my general experience. It used to take basically harassing them to get a bogus review pulled. Not sure if anything has really changed.
hl7x9r2,EssentialTwerker2020,2021-11-18 23:18:53,3,53,That was in June.  I doubt much has changed.  I waited till the final 5-10 minutes before the review period was over to submit my review of her so she had to rush her review and it was almost gibberish. It didnt help me get the review removed but her review seems obviously irrational and emotional so I wrote a very thorough review reply addressing each of her concerns.  I made sure to use the name she preferred to be called instead of the name she booked under... Karen

hl8b208,Hyde4Me,2021-11-19 01:51:54,1,53,I only earn about 11% of my income on Vrbo.  Im a Premier Host there & a Super Host with Airbnb but I just left Vrbo because of their lack of customer service.  I found a glitch in their software (note:  they are a software company!) ... it changes your cancellation policy rules.  They called me trying to get me to switch off of firm to relaxed.  I told them no.  I didnt realize all the guests were already getting relaxed!!!When I noticed an issue and started looking back its been flip flopping back & forth from relaxed to moderate since the account started.  Their history log doesnt show any person on their end or my end changing it.  Yet they arent investigating why that happened.  I opened the account in March.  Every single booking has been affected by this glitch.  Every Vrbo host might be affected yet they dont see it as an issue. :(  I prefer Airbnb.  Ive had one nighmare host & they were amazing and backed me.  And a guest whos child ruined the TV.  The guest paid 1/2 Airbnb picked up the other 1/2.  So far they are doing much better than Vrbo in my experience.
hl8cc2b,Hyde4Me,2021-11-19 02:08:00,3,53,I agree take screen shots & send them to Airbnb.  Its a violation of their Terms of Service to make threats like that.  I had a nighmare guest (also a Host) who has been my worst guest thus far.  She started off askign for a discount which should have been my red flag! She changed her arrival date.  She needed me to console her about being a female traveing alone.  When she arrived she was scared to be there.  She found a broken lock and wanted it replaced immediately.  I told her that window is painted shut but went the next day and replaced the lock.  She left early upset that she couldnt find the carbon monoxide detector (which is integrated with the smoke detector on the wall) that it was a fire hazard that she couldnt open the window (the day before she was afraid a bad guy would come in and get her through that same window) that there were shady people hanging out in front of the house (its our vacation home thats a new one to me ... weve never experienced that or had another guest mention it).  And she threatened that if I didnt give her a large refund (she was seriously asking me to take under $5 per night) that she would leave a bad review.  AirBNB told me how to report her threat on the message thread then called her & tried to get her to release the booking (she was holding my calendar hostage).  One of their employees screwed up & gave her a refund.  The supervisor apologized & reimbursed me from Airbnb funds.  That same supervisor went & read her review (it had not yet posted & I had not yet seen it) and said it also violated their TOS.  She removed it & encouraged me to still leave an honest review so that other hosts would know what to expect.  When I did leave a review the guest lost it & started messaging me & threatening me again.  I had to make yet another call to AirBNB.  They showed showed me how to block her so that she can no longer contact me or book my home.  And they sent me an e-mail to pick a free gift ... for being such a fabulous host.  (I remained calm with their employees through the whole ordeal and did my best to not take out my frustrations on them.  I was frustrated with the guest not them.)  Moral:  Its okay to be frustrated with the guest but be polite to AirBNB.  It will get you much further. )
hl8cmg6,Hyde4Me,2021-11-19 02:11:38,3,6,It starts with the tax year where you started earning income. )
hl8dfxw,Hyde4Me,2021-11-19 02:22:14,2,62,This is what Ive done in the past as well.  If they are asking last minute and its already clean & ready to go Im happy to sign into the lock system & change their start time.  But Im not willing to block off that night (days or weeks in advance) to accomodate their request unless they are paying for that night.  )
hl8dn7d,Hyde4Me,2021-11-19 02:24:52,1,62,And utilities )
hl8dqim,Hyde4Me,2021-11-19 02:26:06,2,62,*This is how you do it!*  I sang that.  LOL
hl8f6wy,IncaThink,2021-11-19 02:46:10,2,53,We ran a restaurant for 17 years and before that I did painting contracting. I figured out long ago that not every customer is worth the trouble.
hl938nc,superduperhosts,2021-11-19 07:29:34,0,53,Guests don‚Äôt care about your rules.  It‚Äôs not 3rd grade.  Treat your guests like adults you will earn better reviews
hl97d0x,trizkit995,2021-11-19 08:03:34,0,2,Resolution center
hl9g5ud,troutscockholster,2021-11-19 09:09:51,1,35,I do 25/night
hl9gero,Peanutbutternbaconn,2021-11-19 09:11:37,2,35,Ohhhh it‚Äôs per night. Weird don‚Äôt know why they wouldn‚Äôt just do it as a set fee.
hl9gm2x,jaminty317,2021-11-19 09:13:04,-2,35,I just dont charge for it am still booked 29/30 nights a month and almost all my guests have a pet lol
hl9gxu0,troutscockholster,2021-11-19 09:15:25,1,35,You can do that as well. Its up to the host. I charge through the resolution center
hl9hna5,ChristinaWSalemOR,2021-11-19 09:20:25,1,62,Agreed!
hl9i5fk,Peanutbutternbaconn,2021-11-19 09:23:57,1,35,They just added the pet fee into the booking process so if you don‚Äôt have it set up in there and the max you can change is $50 it says that pets are free also it‚Äôs not per night it is a total fee
hl9jhy3,troutscockholster,2021-11-19 09:33:25,1,35,Yea no bueno I would just charge through the resolution center.
hl9jn9i,Peanutbutternbaconn,2021-11-19 09:34:26,2,35,Yeah but the issue with that is that if you don‚Äôt use their booking process pet fee when they go to book it says pets are free. I just ran into an issue last night with a guest who didn‚Äôt read my house rules and acted like I tried to pull one over on them when I sent them the request for the pet fee
hl9k1se,troutscockholster,2021-11-19 09:37:11,2,35,oh interesting i had no idea
hl9m3gp,ChristinaWSalemOR,2021-11-19 09:50:53,1,20,A large sectional may work for seating along with a few extra comfy chairs. Maybe an expandable table with bench seating.
hl9ov08,36in36,2021-11-19 10:09:21,1,35,Appears the fee cant be more than the one night stay rate for that unit.
hl9p0ds,Peanutbutternbaconn,2021-11-19 10:10:20,1,35,But my nightly rate is 109
hl9t7j0,superduperhosts,2021-11-19 10:38:13,1,35,it is not per night it is per stay.  Fuck that I will keep collecting it in cash
hl9w1xm,36in36,2021-11-19 10:56:43,1,35,Good point.
hl9wp5f,whysnow,2021-11-19 11:00:50,4,35,Just collect cash at arrival.   Put in your listing that pets are possible but MUST contact host with details before booking.  Then let them know when they contact your terms.  $10 per night per pet is typical in my experience as a renter.
hl9wt26,36in36,2021-11-19 11:01:33,2,35,What are you seeing as a message?  Just under the edit box is where I received the message I mentioned above.
hl9wyuw,Peanutbutternbaconn,2021-11-19 11:02:37,5,35,I was planning on not accepting pets in 2022 as the back yard will now be shared with another unit and I don‚Äôt want the Liability of one units pets hurting someone
hl9x102,Peanutbutternbaconn,2021-11-19 11:03:00,4,35,So Airbnb just forced me to go ahead and implement that now instead of waiting till January
hl9x80w,Peanutbutternbaconn,2021-11-19 11:04:17,1,35,It said that same thing it can‚Äôt be more than the nightly rate but it‚Äôs acting like my nightly rate is $50
hl9xeen,Enough_Insurance,2021-11-19 11:05:25,3,35,$50 for the entire stay? HA!
hl9xjmz,Peanutbutternbaconn,2021-11-19 11:06:22,1,35,I even went night by night to make sure there wasn‚Äôt a night set to $50 for some reason and theirs not
hl9yqua,36in36,2021-11-19 11:14:13,1,35,Its not clear to me where its getting the nightly rate.  The number its showing is a bit higher than the normal rate but within the smart price range.
hla04ks,Logical_Radio2866,2021-11-19 11:23:14,1,6,If you read up on the American Rescue Plan Act it says it starts January 1 2022. Everything before January 1 2022 is subject to the tax laws currently in place. The American Rescue Plan Act amends the $20000 and 200 transactions threshold to a meager $600. If you feel this is not ideal to your beliefs I highly encourage you to run for Congress and get rid of all the old hags in there too.
hla1f4g,troutscockholster,2021-11-19 11:31:42,1,35,Yes with shared space its not worth the liability.
hla48uh,trizkit995,2021-11-19 11:49:51,0,2,Obviously you dont either.
hlab7lm,Fit_Communication426,2021-11-19 12:34:36,2,10,I disagree.  Airbnb policy states that guest must have actually attended the listing the be allowed to write a review .  So if the guest cancels on day of check in and never came to listing. Means that the review would go against the review policy
hlag21o,jrossetti,2021-11-19 13:03:37,0,10,Sorry mate but youre wrong.  I sincerely hope your view changes after this because you are now being given irrefutable proof that your opinion is in fact wrong.  There is only one section in all of the airbnb help files that talks about not being able to leave a review for a guest who did not stay and its explicitly for review manipulation.  Meaning you have a friend or family book they dont stay they leave a review.  Its only found in that section in the context of review manipulation.   No where else.     Moderating for canceled reservations  Airbnb allows you to post reviews for any reservation canceled after 12:00 AM on the day of check-in. We do this to collect feedback on the most crucial moments of a travel experience whether that means feedback about communication house rule violations issues with listing at the time of check-in etc.  If you decide to leave a review for a canceled reservation we do ask that you keep your feedback relevant to what you have personally experienced. In cases where Airbnb can confirm that a review was left for a canceled reservation and the review contains information irrelevant to our community (for example frustrations about a flight cancellation etc.) the review may be removed.   https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/548/airbnbs-dispute-moderation-for-reviews
hlalbi6,EssentialTwerker2020,2021-11-19 13:35:39,4,35,When I first opened I never charged a fee but I quickly learned this was a problem. Bumped it to $10/ visit/ animal still problems. Now its $25/ visit/ animal and people seem to respect it more. I keep a specific color towel and blanket for pet use only and indicate they will be charged for any staining on other linens (the blanket is for the couch). Its a country home with a spring in the front yard LOTS of muddy footprints with careless owners in the beginning. Not so bad now.
hlao2i3,Logical_Radio2866,2021-11-19 13:52:49,12,18,Ask your insurance agent ask your lawyer ask your accountant.
hlas5no,Automatic_Lemon1069,2021-11-19 14:18:38,0,53,I am treating them like adults and adults are supposed to care about rules. Its children that dont care about rules. Maybe you need to grow up.   And I earn great reviews while not sacrificing my entire life to the platform by treating people like adults who are capable of following and understanding rules.
hlat5x8,Dabblinginthevoid,2021-11-19 14:25:01,-1,18,Seems Logical
hlat9wd,secretlyloaded,2021-11-19 14:25:45,3,18,Yeah this is definitely not the question to take to reddit. Yours is a special case and insurance and liability laws vary widely from state to state.
hlax4i7,Enough_Insurance,2021-11-19 14:50:21,1,18,This and your question has nothing to do with the hosting or traveling.
hlay5xe,beaconpropmgmt,2021-11-19 14:57:06,0,18,You really need that umbrella to cover YOU and your assets.  Reach out to a few local brokers and your attorney to help guide you with an LLC and STR insurance.   Honestly not too many captive agents are that well versed in STRs.  You generally dont need an LLC unless you have multiple investment properties.  There are multiple schools of thought on it.  An attorney will be your best resource based on your needs and assets.
hlb4vu2,jpnoa,2021-11-19 15:41:50,0,18,Make sure your umbrella covers business activities and specifically home rentals. Most personal umbrellas wont so it might be useless in the event of a lawsuit. You probably need a specific homeowners policy that includes STR with 1-2M+ liability. As others said insurance agent lawyer accountant.  Also take any legal advice from Reddit with a grain of salt.
hlb9dho,Sickforthesun,2021-11-19 16:12:28,0,18,Is your home UNDER the LLC? You said you formed the LLC after you bought the home. Check with a lawyer but I believe your LLC and your property are two different entities if the LLC isn‚Äôt on the title.
hlbdyq1,Dabblinginthevoid,2021-11-19 16:44:31,-1,18,We planned on quit claim deed-ing it over.
hlbffs5,Dabblinginthevoid,2021-11-19 16:54:41,1,18,Understood and understood
hlbfjpw,Dabblinginthevoid,2021-11-19 16:55:26,1,18,Thx
hlbh2rq,jpnoa,2021-11-19 17:05:57,-1,18,Do you have a mortgage in your personal name? Not sure if a quitclaim is possible if with a mortgage might depend on your state. Either way your bank probably wont allow this and could call the loan.
hlbkpc0,Dabblinginthevoid,2021-11-19 17:31:30,-1,18,Mortgage is in our personal name we are going to call and work to have us left personally as the guarantor but have the real estate title under our LLC.
hlblkgy,jpnoa,2021-11-19 17:37:38,0,18,Good call. Let me know if this works out and if the bank allows it. Didnt know that was an option might try to try the same if it is. Typically a bank wants you to pay an LLC interest rate which is much higher.
hlbnpsp,Dabblinginthevoid,2021-11-19 17:53:05,1,18,Will do thx
hlbnzob,artist_sans_medium,2021-11-19 17:55:04,-2,18,Allstate worked well for us for both umbrella policy as well as homeowners policy with hosting addendum but I‚Äôm not sure if their host advantage policies are offered in Georgia.
hlbobzw,artist_sans_medium,2021-11-19 17:57:36,3,35,$75 / stay is what we charge. Sounds high but we are in a premium market here in Scottsdale Arizona. We collect it separately via resolution center.
hlbpan8,36in36,2021-11-19 18:04:34,1,35,I added it this afternoon to a few units.  Just had a booking come across ... that looks too high for that unit?.  Ahhhh first pet fee was successfully charged.  Instant book no muss no fuss.
hlbq75n,Dabblinginthevoid,2021-11-19 18:11:13,1,18,Great they are our personal provider so will ask.
hlbrct0,Angryceo,2021-11-19 18:19:45,2,19,Schlage encode and use RemoteLock.com to syncs everything up. The automation only fully works with Airbnb. Vrbo you still need to manually create with RemoteLock unless you use yet another company that integrates with RemoteLock and your booking platform
hlbrv57,explain_like_im_10,2021-11-19 18:23:34,5,19,I use all Wyze products. Cheap works well and available at micro center and home Depot. No issues so far.
hlbtcaw,jaminty317,2021-11-19 18:34:43,1,35,I‚Äôve hosted somewhere over 1000 dogs at this point.   Have had one bad owner thus far.   Zero issues otherwise
hlbv98i,Peanutbutternbaconn,2021-11-19 18:49:01,1,35,Be aware that if you don‚Äôt use the pet fee that‚Äôs incorporated into the booking process it appears that it will tell guest pets are free
hlbvs3h,payyourbillstoday,2021-11-19 18:52:55,-2,18,From what my attorney told me. If the home is not under the llc name then someone can sue you directly. If your mortgage company allows you to switch (most don‚Äôt) to the llc then your good. For the most part good umbrella insurance should be fine.
hlc1jv4,Zmyslinski,2021-11-19 19:36:59,1,19,I second Schlange encode.  Regarding Remote Lock I am not familiar with this service. Their website wasnt so clear on what was provided or pricing. How much is the service to automate things?
hlc1yy7,Zmyslinski,2021-11-19 19:40:13,1,19,Also recommend Wyze cameras in particular Wyze Cam V3.   I also have a ring doorbell. A bit redundant but I like the idea of having a back up with a different brand in case things ever fail with Wyze at an inconvenient time.
hlc47ma,themanofchicago,2021-11-19 19:57:43,1,19,I use Google Nest Camera and Doorbell. U-Tec Ultraloq U-Bolt for our digital lock.  Ecobee Thermostat with additional temperature and motion sensors. We are happy with all our choices.
hlc63t9,Angryceo,2021-11-19 20:12:54,1,19,6/month per lock
hlc9kab,STR_Guy,2021-11-19 20:40:55,0,6,I strongly advise using a PMS like OwnerRez. I actually freelance as an integration tech to get people setup as the initial config has a pretty steep learning curve. It has everything baked in from api integration to multiple OTAs like AirBNB and Vrbo to automated messaging digital rental agreements hosted website etc.   https://www.ownerreservations.com?referredBy=oru5b14b4d105x  Feel free to dm if you want more specifics.
hlcayud,agordonwsu,2021-11-19 20:52:55,1,19,I second this.  I have the Wyze lock doorbell and camera at my ABNB and all work well.  I have to manual set a lock code but Im not willing to pay more.
hlcbx18,Trif55,2021-11-19 21:00:58,1,6,What does PMS stand for? OwnerRes looks a lot like BedBooking that has an airbnb channel manager as well I think?
hlcc05b,GrandCorn,2021-11-19 21:01:43,5,35,Allowing pets is an unnecessary headache.
hlccocd,Angryceo,2021-11-19 21:07:31,1,5,why would you want to discount?  are you normally booked up?  if so discounting will just hurt your bottom line.    are you a LTR or STR?  your tax situation differs greatly with most counties on this.    go look at pricelabs for the nightly rate..it will show you what each day is rated for..
hlccvt0,STR_Guy,2021-11-19 21:09:17,1,6,Property management software
hlchj0l,Zmyslinski,2021-11-19 21:50:28,1,19,Thanks!
hlckde7,T-rex_with_a_gun,2021-11-19 22:16:33,1,19,wyze cams and august locks. no need to pay extra for anything. august auto connects to airbnb and creates codes for guests AND messages them automatically w/ code
hlcmri6,Trif55,2021-11-19 22:39:17,1,6,Ahh ok so do you think BedBooking.com is also PMS?
hlctum9,awkwardtriangles,2021-11-19 23:52:25,1,53,I mean this also could be some Jews on the sabbath.
hlcvu9k,artist_sans_medium,2021-11-20 00:15:22,1,35,Yes I‚Äôm curious to see how they set that up. But it does not appear to be available yet.
hlcvyoe,Peanutbutternbaconn,2021-11-20 00:16:51,1,35,I‚Äôm very curious as well because it Became available to me today . So it seems that they‚Äôre introducing it in waves.
hlcwyxn,artist_sans_medium,2021-11-20 00:28:58,1,35,You said there is a $50 limit? Per night or per stay?
hlcz0dk,Peanutbutternbaconn,2021-11-20 00:54:13,2,35,For me it only allowed me to set it to a max of $50 per stay. My pet fee is $80 per stay and because of this I decided I would go ahead and go not pet friendly which was my plan in 2022 because my back yard was going to be shared because I have a tiny home unit that is going live in the beginning of 2022. But it said it needed to be under my max per night but my per night say min is 109
hlcz41j,Peanutbutternbaconn,2021-11-20 00:55:31,1,,I‚Äôm unsure if this is a glitch or if this is the max pet fee they allow per stay
hlczvki,artist_sans_medium,2021-11-20 01:05:26,1,35,Interesting. I guess I will see what limits they put in place for me. Thanks for the info.
hld00wn,Peanutbutternbaconn,2021-11-20 01:07:20,1,35,If you don‚Äôt mind let me know what it lets you do cause I‚Äôm interested to know if it‚Äôs $50 for everyone or if I‚Äôm getting a glitch
hld108j,thepensivemacaron,2021-11-20 01:20:24,1,19,Have heard good things about Yale + nest locks. We are going to put them on our primary residence this week in preparation for our Airbnb this spring (we‚Äôre building). I think if you search ‚ÄòYale‚Äô you‚Äôll find some more info potentially. I‚Äôd be happy to Pm you in a few weeks with our experience/perspective. We will be managing our Airbnb remotely so this aspect is critical to the operating function.
hld9ow7,Luebe,2021-11-20 03:23:33,1,19,We have Nuki-locks. Working perfectly with Airbnb. It creates and sends the codes for guests about 3 days before booking or if short notice guests immediately after booking. We have 3 doors in our property guests are using two of those doors third is our private main door. We get notification when guests use the code first time. Because the code is only valid from our check-in time  if we allow early check-in we change to starting time accordingly. We have keypad on the doors but you can use the locks via App as well.  House temperature is controlled and monitored with Tado turns off the heating if patio door or windows are open. We have also created routines for our lighting turns on the hallway lights when door is opened etc.  With all the automation we have about 25-30% savings in our heating (gas) and electricity bills. We are in Germany Airbnb is separate  basement studio apartment in our house half of the time for our private use  half for paying guests.
hldgpti,PAUL_D74,2021-11-20 05:05:46,2,5,You can see it on pricelabs but you would need to manually work back any monthly discounts or other discounts you have to get their nightly price.
hldj5ya,compuryan,2021-11-20 05:38:45,1,5,Explain that they are paying by the day despite if they booked for 5 months.  Its not a lease.  Days are priced differently from each other and different months have different numbers of days.  Would work the same in a hotel.
hldl2t1,shazbholla,2021-11-20 06:03:50,2,19,Just wanted to comment that all these items are excellent if you are doing the STR yourself or w. property managers and gives you pieces of mind and bit of control.  The one item I would like to add is a temperature gauge that will turns off heat and AC when doors or windows are open.  I see this regularly that guests are cranking AC mostly and the sliding doors are open in 100 degree desert weather. I dont want my unit to burn out quickly because of this behavior. I will investigate the system mentioned below from someone in Germany--hope it is available in US.  For cameras you cant install in a private back yard (had to take those down). Best of luck!
hldov4z,Dabblinginthevoid,2021-11-20 06:49:15,2,18,Thx
hldruyc,Buffett_Goes_OTM,2021-11-20 07:21:10,3,6,I use IGMS and it does just what you‚Äôre talking about. It also automates all the messages to the guests my cleaner and syncs all my calendars across all sites. It‚Äôs only a $1 per booked night.
hldt5r5,redgreenapple,2021-11-20 07:34:19,0,5,Be careful after a certain amount of time local tenant laws kick in and you may be limited in eviction options if things go south
hldtbbj,Trif55,2021-11-20 07:35:50,1,6,Does it have a widget you could add to other websites? Or does it include a dedicated website in that price?  Also I see it has a $12 minimum so at least $144 per property per year or $864+ overall thats a lot more than BedBooking or Lodgify!
hldynv1,yourheynis,2021-11-20 08:25:02,1,35,I charge a $100 pet fee.  Guests bring a dog on about half my bookings. I havent even had anyone question it yet.   Curious to see how this new system works out.   If they bundle it in to the nightly rate we are probably now going to be paying the hotel tax on it?
hle3aq2,Knapplebloom,2021-11-20 09:03:29,1,5,yeah this can get confusing because months have different day counts and can throw off nightly rates.  i usually just offer flat monthly pricing
hle9lcz,troutscockholster,2021-11-20 09:50:58,4,2,If you are asking us how to help you violate the terms of the visa you probably aren‚Äôt going to get a lot of answers
hlec5hk,jrossetti,2021-11-20 10:09:42,1,2,Youre not just asking someone to claim income youre asking someone to be responsible for all of the taxes and actually have to pay money on top of that.  Not to mention what we report and make as income determines how much we have to pay for things like social security.   Make an fein and look up the rules for rental income.  Generally speaking rental income doesnt count as real income or at least it didnt a few years ago when I did an Airbnb with somebody on a Visa.  This is also one of those times when you may want to just consider talking to an attorney that deals with taxes or at the very least an accountant whos familiar.
hlegwr9,artist_sans_medium,2021-11-20 10:44:07,0,2,From what I am reading on the forums only the listing host gets credit regarding super host status. The cohost does not receive any recognition which has generated quite a bit of controversy‚Ä¶ https://community.withairbnb.com/t5/Help/Co-host-Primary-host-Reviews-amp-Superhost/td-p/262992
hleh9v8,artist_sans_medium,2021-11-20 10:46:43,1,19,Another vote for Schlage encode! We use that plus ring cameras. Go for the wired ones not the battery (also interested in remotelock.com. I will look into it thanks!)
hlejf3v,troutscockholster,2021-11-20 11:01:18,0,2,Yes I think either host can respond and that will keep your response metrics the same
hlejkjr,artist_sans_medium,2021-11-20 11:02:22,2,18,Yes I would second this approach. In my market you would have to call the state the county and then the city in order to understand the local laws. And you might still come away thinking you could do a short term rental and then have the homeowners association stop you (and homeowners associations are best avoided if possible). I find that real estate agents in my market are the place to start then follow up with doing your own research and then contacting the local gov‚Äôt. If you‚Äôre in an area with complex laws then you can consult an attorney but otherwise not necessary in my experience if you‚Äôve done your own research. If you Google ‚Äúshort term rental ordinance‚Äù and then the name of your city you will start to find out what laws are on the books.  Where I find a real estate agent helps and maybe an attorney if you have some complex situation is they can tell you if there is already another ordinances that might be coming down the line or if there‚Äôs a lot of conversation at City Hall about putting something new in place. But as others have said whether a real estate agent knows this or not is very market dependent. I usually ask on local STR Facebook forums for referrals to real estate agents who are experienced with short term rentals specifically. Some people will always say that real estate agents are useless for this. My response is: you haven‚Äôt found the right real estate agent yet. But never take with the real estate agent says at face value. Ultimately you are responsible for due diligence.
hleot2s,jrossetti,2021-11-20 11:39:09,2,13,You keep saying they canceled within your cancellation policy. Can you explain to me what you mean by that when you say it?
hlepxib,yourheynis,2021-11-20 11:47:03,2,13,I have a firm cancelation policy so 50% refund if canceled within 14 days no refund if canceled within 7 days.  They canceled within 7 days.
hleuttl,beaconpropmgmt,2021-11-20 12:20:49,1,10,YOU ARE CORRECT and jrossetti is WRONG.  You CAN get a review removed if they never showed.  The poster  who is rebutting you deals with people who walk in and walk right out once they scan his accommodations.  Those people can in fact rightfully review.
hlevnww,horsegrrl,2021-11-20 12:26:37,7,13,Just contact Airbnb and ask them to return the fee.
hlf47ox,Soyl3ntR3d,2021-11-20 13:27:30,1,19,Thanks all for the awesome recommendations.  We are just getting started is there a wiki or some good blogs we should check out?
hlf4yab,Gold-Comfortable-453,2021-11-20 13:32:51,0,53,I am a host and I allow guests to contact me in whatever way works best for them. Not everyone understands all the tech. If its something of concern I follow up on the app to confirm the conversation. I truly dont understand causing bad feelings with a guest over how they contact me.
hlf62j0,1bug1,2021-11-20 13:41:05,1,13,Just send them money through the resolution center
hlf7w03,Knapplebloom,2021-11-20 13:54:25,1,6,never use(d) the today page.
hlfd49p,Logical_Radio2866,2021-11-20 14:33:42,1,6,The Today page is your then-dashboard. Its the homepage of your hosting account on both the app and browser.
hlfebz7,jrossetti,2021-11-20 14:42:45,2,13,You cant if a guest had already been refunded in full.  Theres no option
hlfev21,jrossetti,2021-11-20 14:46:42,4,13,Its my understanding that theyre supposed to show actual proof but I dont know if thats something that they follow religiously.  I also think there might be a slight misunderstanding with terminology because when you say someone canceled within your policy that generally means they canceled within the bounds of what you allow.   These guys canceled outside of your cancellation policy using the extenuating circumstance Airbnb rule.    And Airbnb sent you a message saying the guests canceled because someone in the party had covid and refunded them in full?   (The answer to your specific question is really just reach out to Airbnb Im just trying to find out more about the situation as a whole to understand)
hlffj07,yourheynis,2021-11-20 14:51:42,4,13,Ah youre right the wording i used is confusing.  I should have just said I have a firm cancelation policy and they canceled within 7 days.
hlfge27,Automatic_Lemon1069,2021-11-20 14:58:02,1,53,I dont cause bad feelings by having a house rule that works for me and makes it easier for me to be a host. The guest who rudely refuses to comply with a simple commonsense rule is the person who is causing the bad feelings. I dont know why people like you have difficulty understanding this.  And you know what? Youre causing bad feelings with me. Ive explained my reasons for having the rule repeatedly in this thread. I dont care that you may have a different situation or different feelings. I seriously doubt you are of the belief that hosts arent entitled to have house rules and insist that they be followed. This guest was trying to deny me that. Thats the end of the analysis.
hlfik32,Gold-Comfortable-453,2021-11-20 15:14:23,0,53,In my opinion they arent being rude by calling or texting you as they are a guest and on vacation. If I have a guest that is actually doing something wrong I correct it immediately! My advice would be to pick your battles and dont sweat the small stuff. Best of luck to you in your business.
hlfkrq2,jrossetti,2021-11-20 15:31:05,1,13,Its all good lol.  You probably know two + languages anyway.
hlfmqee,T-rex_with_a_gun,2021-11-20 15:45:59,1,13,they canceled they are not your guest. and not your problem. tell them to reach out to airbnb
hlft0uy,marglobal,2021-11-20 16:33:37,1,3,you don‚Äôt have any options since airbnb documents the proof
hlgakk8,36in36,2021-11-20 18:49:09,3,6,Today for me says Currently Hosting: 1.  We had six departures six arrivals.  Ive never seen the today page be accurate.
hlgjngz,robanywhere,2021-11-20 20:02:55,5,6,It‚Äôs so incomplete/inaccurate to be almost useless. But if you click on All reservations it provides some marginally useful info.
hlgjnl1,Automatic_Lemon1069,2021-11-20 20:02:56,1,53,They are being rude by calling or texting when I have a house rule limiting communications to Airbnb messenger. You dont think it is wrong for a guest to violate one of your house rules? You think that its ok for guests to book rooms with certain rules and then violate those rules because they believe that the rule shouldnt exist or that violating it just isnt a big deal?  If your answer to those questions is in the affirmative your position is unreasonable uncalled for and hypocritical. Im sure that you tell guests to obey certain house rules as well and politely remind them to do so when they do not. I did nothing more than that.
hlgkwgs,Gold-Comfortable-453,2021-11-20 20:13:26,0,53,I dont think you understand the definition of rude. Im simply suggesting that you not get so upset ( your words) that someone contacted outside of an app. Life is to short it is truly a small thing. To be blunt I think your house rule to only contact you on the app is unreasonable. How many time does that app stop working - alot from my experience. Again this is just my opinion and you posted looking for opinions. If you only want people to agree with you thats not very productive.
hlgmlp8,Automatic_Lemon1069,2021-11-20 20:27:46,1,53,My rule is not unreasonable. Im not even going to get into all the personal details with you but Id have to quit Airbnb entirely if I were opening myself up to being called or texted all the time from multiple guests. This is a side business and it would interfere excessively with my daily life. And whether it is reasonable or not is something that concerns my needs not yours and not theirs. I am not forcing anybody to book with me and Im very up front about my house rules. It is rude for a person to book my rooms with no intention of obeying my house rules.  I definitely understand the definition of rude. You are being rude by defending people who break house rules and saying that it is not impolite for them to do so. Its also presumptuous to say that it is unreasonable to set such a rule. Your needs are not mine. Stop presuming they are.   In my experience Airbnbs servers very rarely go down entirely and if there is a true emergency my policy still allows guests to call me. I just dont want routine communications going through my cell phone line. By your logic though I shouldnt get to set that rule and other people know better than I do what rules I need to set. By your logic a guest should be able move bring pets or extra occupants because barring them is unreasonable to them and you shouldnt sweat the small stuff.  I saw elsewhere where you said that a guest allowing a person not on the booking come in and take a shower was stealing. Thats actually something that wouldnt especially bother me despite being against my house rules. However Im not going to gainsay that it would bother you more than me and since it violates a house rules you should certainly be able to politely enforce it. Youre not affording me the same courtesy.  I dont expect everyone to agree with me but I expect them not to be hypocritical and misrepresent the situation. Youre doing a good job of both.
hlgn7by,Gold-Comfortable-453,2021-11-20 20:32:53,0,53,Again I wish you all the best. Im starting to think you are just messing with me as I havent said anything to upset you. All good and thanks for the laugh :).
hlgnapn,FanyWest23,2021-11-20 20:33:40,2,13,Yep that‚Äôs what I did the fee was refunded quickly and all was well.
hlgob79,FanyWest23,2021-11-20 20:42:14,2,13,I didn‚Äôt find it confusing at all. I‚Äôve had this exact situation happen I contacted AirBnb help and asked them to refund the fee and they did it for me.
hlgoj7t,superduperhosts,2021-11-20 20:44:09,1,13,Tell the guests to request the money through resolution center
hlgpbtn,FanyWest23,2021-11-20 20:50:58,6,6,Yeah I just use the calendar page. I hate the today page and I miss the easier to access listing link. I do not understand why AirBnb keeps spending money to frig around with bullshit like this rather than fix the actual problems.
hlgpiyo,Automatic_Lemon1069,2021-11-20 20:52:40,1,53,Ah and now you resort to plain mockery. I dont find this funny Im sick and tired of hosts like yourself who pull this holier-than-thou attitude by defending bad guests. Im not sure why satisfaction you get from it.
hlh3yjq,Aprioribox,2021-11-20 23:06:58,4,11,Most people dont read so I wouldnt do that.
hlhcaav,richardtallent,2021-11-21 00:38:44,1,11,Im from a warmer climate (the hot humid armpit of Texas) and while 75 is perfectly comfy during the day I dont sleep well unless the temp is 72 or lower. Dont lie about amenities.  I also get pinged about amenities they want me to add -- allowing pets and allowing long-term stays (> 1 month). I dont want to do either so I just ignore those recommendations.
hlhhhlf,orob222,2021-11-21 01:42:02,2,11,I hear you. I live near you full time (DFW). I love my AC. To be clear at the rental it‚Äôs a high of 75 and dry in August. Normally the highs at that altitude in the summer spans from 60‚Äôs to low 70‚Äôs. 75 is a ‚Äúwarm‚Äù day. Lows at night in the 50‚Äôs in the summer.  Just struggling with all the competition that claims to have AC that I know damn well doesn‚Äôt snd the bookings that may be passing me up. But I hear you.
hlhsd29,WynterRaynne,2021-11-21 04:03:46,3,11,Dont be misleading in your listing. I think you have a good point about people just not truly understanding the climate up there and putting a small A/C unit in your place will likely be enough to entice anyone you might be missing now.
hli1tp5,Angryceo,2021-11-21 06:04:55,3,7, I have 3 homes there is a 20% swing up and down across my properties from what airdna thinks.   They cannot tell a booked night vs a blocked night.   Data is skewed
hli3csg,Zmyslinski,2021-11-21 06:22:50,4,11,A basic window AC unit is like $150. Buy it and install in the summer or else make arrangements to have it installed if the high temperature gets above X. You could then specify these details within your listing and still be able to justify AC as an amenity. You dont need to offer central AC or window units throughout the property but trying to claim passive AC will set you up for trouble at some point.  If your place is still booking at a reasonable rate I wouldnt bother but it would be a relatively cheap piece of mind solution for guests worried about baking due to a heatwave that may or may not come during their vacation.
hli5wwl,heybrahbrahh,2021-11-21 06:51:19,2,16,Make it a requirement for guests to send you a pet fee in the resolution center before check in. Just make sure this is in your house rules. That should help avoiding the limit.
hli6aou,Mayor_of_BBQ,2021-11-21 06:55:16,5,11,similar situation where the unit is in the mountains. We‚Äôre at much lower elevation and it is hot enough for AC a couple months out of the year (just July and August). My solution is this list AC as an amenity and purchase a window unit. The window unit stays sitting in the floor of the locked owners closet 10 out of 12 months a year. I‚Äôll install it in July and take it out after the first week of September. In May/June/September I include in the check instructions that I have a window AC available  if they want it i can stick it in the window when I‚Äôm doing the changeover.
hli7cn1,zulu1239,2021-11-21 07:06:16,1,16,It does and this is the way it‚Äôs set up now. The frustrating part is that Airbnb made a big deal about this update and how it‚Äôs better and easier for everyone when in reality it‚Äôs just another way that Airbnb is trying to coerce hosts to lower our prices.
hlic8yw,OilSlickRickRubin,2021-11-21 07:53:42,4,16,So if your nightly rate is $100 (taking a guess) you charge $400 for a pet fee? Am I reading that correctly?
hlicpi2,HeyUKidsGetOffMyLine,2021-11-21 07:57:49,1,7,I‚Äôm not sure anything is an actual value on AirDNA.  I consider this program more of a novelty than investment tool.
hlid5bk,wtfie,2021-11-21 08:01:52,2,16,Because a pet fee isnt usually a deep cleaning fee. It seems like collecting a security deposit would make more sense in your situation.
hlid899,wtfie,2021-11-21 08:02:38,9,16,Yeah what the heck? Who on Earth agrees to that?
hlidxoa,DerelictDingus,2021-11-21 08:08:59,1,11,Silly question but we get a lot of guests from your area and most seem to have the same AC preferences you have. Its difficult because I rent out a guest suite and when they turn the AC down to the low 70s or high 60s I think its too cold. Im comfortable at 80 and Im from Southern Arizona. So Im confused by your statement that you like it colder even though you live in a hot and humid place. Wouldnt you acclimate at some point and like it warm? Obviously thats not the case but I dont get it. Anyway Im just wondering why folks from your area like it so cold.
hlieofh,sloth-mode,2021-11-21 08:15:34,1,14,Uh red flag. Birth tourism is not entirely legal. Please read up a bit on this and protect yourself. It really sounds like this lady is slightly taking advantage of your kindness.  It‚Äôs usually done under the table where the tourists pay the hosts $20-$50000 to keep it under wraps.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-12-16/birth-tourism-company-owner-prison%3F_amp%3Dtrue  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/20-charged-in-crackdown-on-birth-tourism-to-u-s-by-chinese-women/  There was a movie about this: Finding Mr Right
hlifeof,OilSlickRickRubin,2021-11-21 08:21:49,-1,16,That is not a pet fee. Its just a money grab if that is what is being charged.   We allow pets but do not charge a pet fee. We have a $500 security deposit and we also deep clean if there was a pet or not.
hlifqx1,wtfie,2021-11-21 08:24:44,5,16,Im trying to give OP the benefit of the doubt but yeah Im confused how anyone would ever agree to that pricing...   Ive been looking forward to a pet fee option personally - makes *no* sense that I could add an automatic fee for an extra person but not pets...?! Airbnb is so backwards sometimes.  ETA - and the people with pets often leave the place cleaner than those without anyway...
hlifxbo,sloth-mode,2021-11-21 08:26:16,1,14,Yeah. Massive red flags. Why is no one in this thread flagging this. Paid birth tourism is illegal.
hligcr5,wtfie,2021-11-21 08:29:57,1,7,I disagree with the other comments. Its been very accurate for our listing and the next market over from us is very different. But our market is unusually tiny so ymmv.  They are also a newer company so the customer service is very good and I know they are developing new features based on feedback.
hlighxl,Cloud_Gnash,2021-11-21 08:31:10,2,7,I think they key is cross validation. Alone Airdna wont tell you all you need or be that accurate. But combined with other sources (pricelabs anecdotal host info from a market Airbnb platform research) it can help paint a full picture
hlihodj,richardtallent,2021-11-21 08:40:39,3,11,Its a fair question! I can only answer for me of course. And for me humidity at night (that clammy feeling especially with no air moving around) is unbearable.  So while were acclimated to warm weather during the day (today well have a high of 79F) at night we run the AC to control humidity and keep air moving. So thats why were accustomed to a lower night temperature (and used to the weight of a blanket year-round).  Ceiling fans in bedrooms are also very common here since it keeps the air moving and allows us to not run the AC quite so hard. But in my case for example the ceiling fan was installed in 1925 and its low setting feels like youre standing under a helicopter (its *wonderful* if the AC is out of service).  I suppose if more of us here had whole-house dehumidifiers we might have a wider temperature comfort zone for sleeping like folks do who live in dryer climates. But thats almost unheard of here probably because 8-9 months out of the year were running the AC anyway.
hlii569,richardtallent,2021-11-21 08:44:27,1,11,Yeah it would be sweet if AirBnB had smarter default filters. Maybe something where the user has a default search for AC but when searching in a naturally-cool area it could loosen that filter and give them a clear notice at the top of the listing. Maybe something like This listing does not have an AC but the location and dates you are searching are unlikely to have temperatures exceeding 70-75F and the average humidity is __%.
hlil9fr,DerelictDingus,2021-11-21 09:08:23,2,11,Ha thanks for answering. That would also explain the fans. Even though it was cold I thought our AC wasnt working well enough because a couple times the ceiling fans were running and both of the little counter top fans were moved into the bedroom. It was a wind tunnel.
hlino60,zulu1239,2021-11-21 09:26:03,8,16,By deep clean I mean shampoo all the carpets and the upholstery etc. to ensure all pet dander is out of the house to make it safe for future guests with allergies. Our cleaners charge $600 for this for our 4000 sf house. So if people really want to bring their pets we can accommodate but it costs that extra amount to make it allergy safe again. No money grab here as we don‚Äôt see a cent of it - it all goes to our cleaners.
hlio92r,HeyUKidsGetOffMyLine,2021-11-21 09:30:11,1,7,You hit it you want as full of a picture as possible.  AirDNA can be part of it but I would never invest based on AirDNA.
hlip071,superduperhosts,2021-11-21 09:35:31,8,16,I charge per pet per night the way I read it AirBnb is trying to force hosts to charge a flat rate per stay.  There is also no way I see to limit the number of pets or the species.  I allow one dog with approval I may allow two.  I think this is going to backfire when hosts just stop allowing pets.
hlip4ka,superduperhosts,2021-11-21 09:36:21,7,16,**Why on earth would Airbnb cap the amount I can charge as a pet fee?**  They want to force us into the race to the bottom.
hliro3i,Kooky_Bus503,2021-11-21 09:53:58,0,39,You said you changed hosting to a two night minimum. That goes a long way to prevent a party atmosphere.  I host in a city that‚Äôs next to two intersecting interstates. It‚Äôs a prime spot for stopping for the night if you‚Äôre traveling. It‚Äôs a bit more work but I‚Äôm keeping the one night minimum to help these travelers out.
hlis240,Kooky_Bus503,2021-11-21 09:56:41,1,42,Amen
hliwx62,Billy_Osteen,2021-11-21 10:29:57,0,16,Lower your nightly rate now. Also you worry about allergies and stuff like that if people are reading your listing you shouldn‚Äôt have to spend an arm and a leg every time. If they knowingly rent a place that is pet friendly and they don‚Äôt have pets and have allergies it‚Äôs on them. Maybe do it once a month or after a certain amount of times having a pet. Or another option is just not to allow pets unless your market is just that big on pets.
hlix2bh,wtfie,2021-11-21 10:30:58,7,16,> shampoo all the carpets and the upholstery etc. to ensure all pet dander is out  That is... so much overkill. The carpets dont need to be shampooed every time if your cleaners know how to use a vacuum and a duster lol. Sure maybe once or twice a year its called for but thats going to be the case with any rental unit pets or not.  That much intense cleaning is a great way to wear everything out prematurely too...  >make it safe for future guests with allergies  So why even bother to list it as pet friendly if your priority is obviously on keeping it hypoallergenic? I imagine people with allergies THAT severe would rather not take the risk anyway and skip over your listing if they believe anyones ever had a pet in it.  I still think it would be more appropriate to charge a security deposit for the chance it really does get fucked up and only get it deep cleaned when necessary or routine. Seems a bit unfair to me to make the pet owners essentially pony up 100% for routine wear and tear from *all* users.
hlj8afs,orob222,2021-11-21 11:47:52,2,11,Brilliant. I have the answer. Thanks.
hljb4wp,ChristinaWSalemOR,2021-11-21 12:07:06,1,18,Agree! My agent in CA was able to inform me about rules for the HOAs that she was showing us but she did not know all cities or unincorporated county STR rules. Really need to check that out before even looking so know what youre allowed to do and if you are looking in an area that has recently banned or placed a moratorium on STRs you may want to try another area.
hljcouz,GorillaKhan,2021-11-21 12:17:35,1,7,Combine that with how they include cleaning fees into the rent and their data is very rosy.
hljd12g,Sandvik95,2021-11-21 12:19:48,1,16,If guests send money through the resolution center does Airbnb add their fee and tax to it?  I‚Äôve simply revise the reservations with a pet with the guests approval but it adds about 25% on top of my $40 due to the added fees.
hljeh8b,Sandvik95,2021-11-21 12:29:04,2,16,Quoting from Airbnb‚Äôs description of their new policy:  ‚ÄúThis fee is designed to cover the cost of the expected cleaning you‚Äôd do after hosting four-legged guests.‚Äù
hljgz2s,Angryceo,2021-11-21 12:45:08,3,7,I‚Äôm just happy more people are realizing how crappy airdna is
hljy9i8,HeyUKidsGetOffMyLine,2021-11-21 14:39:08,1,7,It could be flawed.  Next step is to do more market research and try to verify AirDNAs numbers by finding the actual comps and looking at real numbers.  If the comps don‚Äôt exist and you don‚Äôt see income in their future calendars then the AirDNA data is most likely wrong.
hljz5u1,Melly5234,2021-11-21 14:45:10,1,7,When you say income in their future calendars you mean like if I were to click their profile and there aren‚Äôt any bookings or if there are whole months blocked off it‚Äôs likely a flaw?
hljzd4c,HeyUKidsGetOffMyLine,2021-11-21 14:46:31,1,7,Yeah look and see if they are actually operating a rental or just have it blocked for months at a time.

hlkengz,Hellsbells247a,2021-11-21 16:32:19,1,8,As I mentioned earlier you should estimate based on the work involved. Each project is different. Get a brief for the client to understand the project scope and quote based on that.  Obviously hosts will look for those who are professional writers/who understand the STR market.
hlkf370,Hellsbells247a,2021-11-21 16:35:29,1,17,Wow you are full of human kindness arent you.
hlkfi49,Hellsbells247a,2021-11-21 16:38:32,1,17,Cant believe all the comments here....and they say guests dont read. Jeez.  Airbnb are offering to cover the costs of host accommodation (not sure what the cap is for this) for Afghan refugees coming in the recent wave after the US pulled out with no notice and left millions vulnerable.   Having said that I wouldnt offer my accommodation to refugees through Airbnb . I offer accommodation through a local refugee charity that properly vets refugees and hosts and offers a package of support to help refugees settle.
hlkfm8a,Hellsbells247a,2021-11-21 16:39:22,1,17,Yes you are both missing something Airbnb is offering to subsidise the cost.

hlkl3f9,jrossetti,2021-11-21 17:19:53,6,9,Shared yards do not matter in terms of how you list your property.    Your listing is accurate assuming all the amenities kitchenette and such are properly disclosed and labeled and that the entrance to each individual room is on the EXTERIOR of the building.  If they have to go into your house in the bottom floor to gain access those are private rooms at that point due to the necessity to go into the house to gain access through the living room or whatever.  That cant be an entire place as they have to walk through your home to access a bedroom in your home.    Private room ads share common spaces like living room kitchen maybe a bathroom if it isnt an ensuite etc.  It doesnt look at yard and driveway.
hlkpmmb,eeek1970,2021-11-21 17:53:38,7,9,You have exactly what I have and I‚Äôm listed as entire place. I‚Äôm very clear that it is a mother in law type apartment and not the whole house in my listing. So many people assume they are getting the whole house because they don‚Äôt read the listing all the way through.
hlkrnc7,jrossetti,2021-11-21 18:08:54,-3,9,Someone has to enter your home walk through your living room/kitchen/dining room or other room of your house to access it?    Or is there an external entry that allows them to gain access without entering your home though the entire suite is in your home.    The first one is a private room the second one is an attached guest suite.  No one should have to read through the entire listing to know what they are getting insofar as entire place or private room as a host should be selecting the appropriate markers and the guest should know instantly based on what it says there.
hlksc7w,Melly5234,2021-11-21 18:14:10,4,7,I did - I realized my question wasnt concise and I didnt explain myself properly. Or perhaps I just didnt understand everyones answers. This thread was more helpful. thanks.
hlksh90,zulu1239,2021-11-21 18:15:17,1,16,Exactly. So why would they cap it? Everyone has different expected cleaning costs after hosting pets.
hlkwzkf,OakIsland2015,2021-11-21 18:49:53,2,8,Hosted over 10000 guests  Are you affiliated with Super 8 Motel?  Holy cow.
hlkxvwl,IncaThink,2021-11-21 18:56:53,1,6,Ive only got two rooms and its rarely accurate.
hlky3pl,Maybe_Black_Mesa,2021-11-21 18:58:38,1,8,Seriously! Also if theyre at the 10000 guest mark why the fuck are they asking these questions here? At this point if that number is true they should have all the ins outs ups downs procedures solutions expectations and reality dialed in. What could us non-hoteliers possibly offer?
hlky82u,OakIsland2015,2021-11-21 18:59:35,2,8,Glad it wasn‚Äôt just me. Lol
hlkygtu,zultan8888,2021-11-21 19:01:32,1,8,Ha! Feels like it sometimes. We have a management company and take care of several large homes. Not 10000 reservations though. About 2500 but our avg reservation is 7 people. So definitely over 10000 guests.
hlkyt33,robanywhere,2021-11-21 19:04:16,1,19,I have Wyze doorbells on my three STRs and have repeated connection failures on ALL of them. After analyzing the problem using RouteThis (their app) they say there is too much signal interference (all my other remote locks thermostats switches etc have no issues). Their solution: Cycle the circuit breaker when this happens.... Finally installed a WiFi remote kill switch to cut the power remotely when the doorbells become disconnected. Would not recommend Wyze for STRs (doorbell cams locks  work fine for my house though).
hlkz5cs,robanywhere,2021-11-21 19:06:59,1,19,Wyze video products need CamPlus subscription to be useful for playback and person detection.
hlkzrfw,T-rex_with_a_gun,2021-11-21 19:11:52,1,19,false? (not 100% sure) but afaik mine works to local without issue (right to sd card)
hll04h1,eeek1970,2021-11-21 19:14:45,4,9,My space is set up like op‚Äôs private entrance and completely separate. Not sure how you got that anyone is going through my part of the home. Also it‚Äôs the very first thing in my listing. And yes people should read the listing to know what they are getting along with the house rules. If you want basic they can stay at motel 6.
hll0nbh,zultan8888,2021-11-21 19:18:51,0,8,Thanks for your thoughtful insight.
hll10p2,robanywhere,2021-11-21 19:21:43,1,19,Schlage Encode locks are very good. Using Nest Sensi and Wyze thermostats - Nest is easily the best Wyze the worst. Tried various video doorbells (RemoBell+ MECO Wyze) and not entirely happy with any of them.
hll1ikq,robanywhere,2021-11-21 19:25:39,1,19,Recording to SD card for cams v1 to v3  but need to pay for person detection or be grandfathered in to their previously free detection. For cloud storage need CamPlus esp for doorbells with no SD card.
hll2smv,mygyg1975,2021-11-21 19:35:41,2,9,Yes everything is properly disclosed and the private entrance is on the exterior of the house. The space is entirely the guest‚Äôs. Thank you for your input!
hll40tf,Maybe_Black_Mesa,2021-11-21 19:45:19,0,8,Always happy to let a hotelier know that this isnt the place to piss and moan over $23.54 they should have been prepared to contact CS over.
hll7271,Tenesmus83,2021-11-21 20:08:44,1,3,Is their a go to place to find this info or I just have to keep googling until I find the answer
hll7v7u,OakIsland2015,2021-11-21 20:15:03,1,8,Oh man. Why did you take your post down.  This was going to be a fun thread.  Lol.
hll8och,zultan8888,2021-11-21 20:21:31,2,8,Got answer I needed. Someone who used to work CS is DM‚Äông with me.
hllsla6,RoomHostingSystem,2021-11-21 23:09:22,1,9,As long as it has its own entrance which it does and you are not accessing any part of the bedroom and bathroom then an entire place is the accurate listing type.   It kinda sounds like the guest was especially a suite to have more rooms. If that‚Äôs the case that is entirely on them since they could clearly see in advance what was included and if the description was unclear the picture should have made it abundantly clear.
hlluv7s,ExpensiveAd4496,2021-11-21 23:32:44,2,9,You checked all the correct boxes for a studio apt with Sep entrance in a multi unit building. It‚Äôs just that AirBnB has everything under either ‚Äúentire place‚Äù or a ‚Äúshared space‚Äù so an apt connected to a home can seem confusing. I‚Äôve dealt with it in my title: ‚ÄúBsmt apt in charming Renovated 1923 bungalow.‚Äù Or something like that. One of my photos shows the exterior of the house because it‚Äôs cuteness is a selling point but I added a prominent arrow pointing to the apartment entrance door clearly a side entrance that is 4 steps down.
hlm6wt2,Specialist-codpiece,2021-11-22 01:56:06,1,17,Go away
hlmebi5,danthemaninacan2,2021-11-22 03:42:42,1,7,Yeah it‚Äôs not reliable. Shocking really considering how expensive it is for data that‚Äôs not reliable.
hlmf3kj,GiGoVX,2021-11-22 03:54:22,13,12,So.... you dont send your guests a goodbye message? This would stop this kind of issue in the future. Something along the lines of Thank you for staying with us please can you ensure rubbish is put in the bins and the keys are placed back in the keysafe etc.... and checkout time is 11am  Also an external camera would be useful so you can see when guests come and go. We noticed one of our guests check out a day early which was a bonus.  I would respond in the Airbnb app saying something like Thank you for your message via WhatsApp (attach a screenshot of it in the message thread) saying you are checking out today. Please note that I will have to request an additional nights stay as check out was yesterday Im sure its an oversight and you didnt realise that your booking ended yesterday fortunatly I didnt have any guests checking in today Im so glad you found the place so comfy and were happy with your stay.  Hopefully they will be happy with stumping up the additional nights fee however I would say its on you not to check they were leaving on the correct day.
hlmijcs,TheJudgyMcJudgeFace,2021-11-22 04:44:52,0,3,I‚Äôm in the process of doing this.   Check hosttool blog who wrote at length about what you need to setup a Airbnb from management to ‚Äúadvertising‚Äù via cleaning and amenities must have.   PS: I‚Äôm not affiliated with them and chose a different PMS / channel manager but their blog is fantastic
hlml1wd,Unlikely-Collar4088,2021-11-22 05:20:01,8,12,This has happened to me but because I live on the property and actually do my own cleaning I was able to politely inform the guests of their mistake on their second day. They quickly paid for a third day and no harm done.   There are risks involved with being an absentee host.
hlmv67x,eeek1970,2021-11-22 07:15:22,1,9,I‚Äôve done similar but the arrow is a great touch I‚Äôm going to do that too.
hlmwaq5,firstmf,2021-11-22 07:26:07,6,12,They agreed to pay the extra night after politely informing them that they stayed longer. Thanks for the answers ^^
hlmwnen,NicRC,2021-11-22 07:29:23,1,12,Are they a new user? I dont know what messages Airbnb sends to guests before check-out (if any) but I am sure they must have gotten the email to review their stay right after check-out time on the 21st. That should have been a clue to them but if they are older and dont check their email they could have missed it.   I would send them a request for an additional night through airbnb (with a slight discount). If you are polite and if they are honest people and dont want a bad review they will probably accept it.
hlmx2p6,firstmf,2021-11-22 07:33:20,2,12,Sorted it they sent me the extra night fee as they agreed they were in the wrong. I was thinking the same about the review e-mail maybe they were not used to airbnb and considered it a reminder to leave the review after their stay ended.
hln0ruh,OakIsland2015,2021-11-22 08:06:02,-2,12,bUT iF TheY arE OLdER aND DON‚Äôt chECK TheiR EMaIL  Why in the world would age be a factor in this?  Old people spend more time on phones Facebook and computers than any other generation.  It‚Äôs simply someone who was most likely new and didn‚Äôt understand how the bookings work.  I‚Äôve had more 20 something‚Äôs think this way than ‚Äúold people.‚Äù
hln4ra2,NicRC,2021-11-22 08:38:29,2,12,Ive had problems with older (70+) guests not seeing my airbnb messages because they only check their email once or twice a week. They sometimes have older phones which do not support the airbnb app. Sometimes they dont even use email on their phones. When the booking is made they think thats that and only want to communicate via phone and text before arrival and during their stay. Extremely pleasant and respectful guests most of the time.   But I have two different listings in different cities and that only happens at one of them because of the type of guests that it attracts.
hln5mrt,Gbcan11,2021-11-22 08:45:14,1,12,Every time I have a guest that doesnt have the airbnb app and is absurdly confused by using the platform its always an older individual.
hln8alo,Angryceo,2021-11-22 09:05:17,4,14,your geocoding is probably jacked reach out to support.  Happened to me on new construction.
hln91iw,advokatethis,2021-11-22 09:10:50,1,14,Thanks I will contact them!
hlna579,gortiz86,2021-11-22 09:18:55,2,12,Two times has it occurred that a guest makes a reservation for let‚Äôs say 22-23 and they think that‚Äôs two whole days when it‚Äôs only one night. Ever since automated messages came up I make sure that in my confirmation message I inform them the check-in and check-out dates and times. A message on the night before check-out thanking them also helps.
hlnfoii,elblakay,2021-11-22 09:58:02,3,12,Yes this same thing happened to me!   We had a guest stay with us for 1 night but on the second day when we went to flip it we saw all his stuff.   He was also a superhost and was very confused when we called him and subsequently changed his reservation to 2 nights.
hlngu3e,BodybuilderVarious51,2021-11-22 10:05:55,1,3,My husband handled all that stuff I did the decorations.  Buy all your stuff from value village and the dollar store. I spent 1000s of dollars on stuff and almost everything has been broken or damaged.   Buy cheap use faux greenery to fill up and warm up the place. Facebook marketplace has lots of free stuff.  We have a cottage and I find that people prefer a warm modern look vs a rustic cottage look.   I did a modern eclectic boho-ish look and it‚Äôs been LOVED and all off of of fb marketplace. Mix pcs up find things you love and it just works. Make it your own.    Good luck
hlnj8e8,TokyBoi,2021-11-22 10:22:14,5,14,I have 9 listings all on the same street and this has happened to me. Airbnb told me it‚Äôs just how the algorithm works and that there‚Äôs nothing they can do to change that. I‚Äôve brought this to their attention twice but nothing changed. Oddly enough it hasn‚Äôt affected my bookings at all.
hlnjqx8,advokatethis,2021-11-22 10:25:42,3,14,Yeah I contacted support and they escalated it to *someone*. They said theyd get back to me so they at least agreed it was a problem. I have had a few bookings so I cant tell if its been affecting me getting booked. Im not sure when the problem started.
hlnk5y6,lAltroUomo,2021-11-22 10:28:32,5,14,Happened to me.  I reached out to support and they gave me some bullsh.  I escalated bugged the crap out of them for two days and it was magically fixed.
hlnkecn,advokatethis,2021-11-22 10:30:06,3,14,Good to know! They have supposedly escalated and said someone would be in touch...
hlnlori,lAltroUomo,2021-11-22 10:38:53,4,14,They tried to tell me I didnt have any bookings because it was slow season. I kept on them explaining I had two friends looking for my listing on open dates and it was not showing up in any search and I was very upset with theor team being dismissive of my concern.  Poof two days later I get three bookings in an hour - Id lowered pricing thinking that was the problem - and my listing was back up on the search.
hlnm5os,advokatethis,2021-11-22 10:42:03,3,14,Yeah I dropped my prices too thinking maybe it was some shady blacklisting for not using their suggested prices. But that still didnt fix it yet. I will stay on top of them if it isnt back up by tomorrow morning.
hlnqrw2,vagimite2000,2021-11-22 11:12:54,2,7,Huh? I dont understand.
hlnsezl,Mayor_of_BBQ,2021-11-22 11:23:52,3,12,why are you communicating with guest through WhatsApp? I don‚Äôt know how many times it has to be sad but you should only be communicating with your guest through the app. No text no signal no WhatsApp no Snapchat no Facebook messenger. Use the Airbnb app they are taking your money! that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre paying them for
hlnuxjk,pacman098706,2021-11-22 11:40:27,4,7,You do if you want to stay at my place in the very least.
hlnv0lb,Antique_Champion_147,2021-11-22 11:41:00,-2,7,You want the acc?
hlnv64y,Antique_Champion_147,2021-11-22 11:42:00,-2,7,I‚Äôm selling my Airbnb account do you want it?
hlnvbs4,vagimite2000,2021-11-22 11:43:01,1,7,No. Isnt that against TOS?
hlnvbue,OakIsland2015,2021-11-22 11:43:02,2,12,Well I‚Äôm an ‚Äúolder person‚Äù and am more tech savvy than a lot of my guests.  Also many people young and old do not download the Airbnb app so they don‚Äôt get messages.  If the guest contacted through WhatsApp I would tend to think they were younger as many ‚Äúold folks‚Äù don‚Äôt even know what WhatsApp is!    If I need to reach guests prior to during or after checkin and they don‚Äôt respond to a message on the app just text or call them on the phone number Airbnb has provided you for contact purposes.  It is provided for a reason.
hlnvbux,IamtheHuntress,2021-11-22 11:43:02,1,7,Yeah thats kind of against TOS and not many hosts or guests would be willing to be shut down over it
hlnxx3l,HeyUKidsGetOffMyLine,2021-11-22 11:59:48,0,7,AirDNA isn‚Äôt their core business AirBNB is.  They are just selling the data because they have it.  If it was truly valuable someone would have bought exclusive rights to the data or they would be hording it for themselves.  Just look Zillow to see how trusting an algorithm to buy property can go wrong.  At the end of it all you are paying more for a dashboard than the data inside because the data is technically free on the platforms that sells the STR directly to the consumer.
hlo1uxo,Gbcan11,2021-11-22 12:25:44,1,7,This person was also selling a dash account. Degenerate.
hlo2xel,AlienPearl,2021-11-22 12:32:45,1,12,Only have your own website if you can charge damage deposit upfront or have a house rental insurance. Most people will be ok paying a refundable damage deposit than paying the Airbnb extra fees.
hlo4tsd,DegaussedMixtape,2021-11-22 12:45:22,14,12,If your savings were truly 3% it may not be worth it to run your own website for private booking.  Unfortunately the real number that the guest pay is 14%.  [https://www.airbnb.com/resources/hosting-homes/a/how-much-does-airbnb-charge-hosts-288](https://www.airbnb.com/resources/hosting-homes/a/how-much-does-airbnb-charge-hosts-288)  If your guest has a subtotal of $700 after their rent+cleaning fee they have to pay \~$100 to airbnb in fees which really can add up.    Use a tool to sync up your calendar between Airbnb VRBO and your private listing.  Continue to let Airbnb take their cut if people are finding you on their platform but leave business cards in your property with your direct booking site.  If a guest wants to come back a second time they can direct book you through your site and their rates can be slightly lower while your cut is also higher.    Do not under any circumstance try to direct people from your Airbnb listing or messages to your private listing or you could get perma-banned and tank your business.

hloauq0,Routine_Echo_186,2021-11-22 13:25:36,3,12,Wow thank you for the insight. I didnt see the point but i think i understand now this is mostly for the guests not the hosts.
hloazxy,Routine_Echo_186,2021-11-22 13:26:36,-1,12,Okay i see Thank You!
hloco53,STR_Guy,2021-11-22 13:37:46,2,12,Thats all about your own personal perspective. For me it all depends on my perception of the company or individual running the rental. I have no issue with hosts trying to convert to direct booking. Both parties save on fees & commissions. Ive been booking direct for years. I know where to look and it hasnt caused any issues yet. I assure you that when the rubber actually meets the road and some sort of serious issue arises with a host or property AirBNB is quite worthless. AirBNB is good for marketing reach and thats about where the buck stops. And the host guarantee is useless too.      As in any business you want to look into the ways you can maximize your revenue and reduce unnecessary costs. Repeat guests via direct book is part of the secret sauce to really maximize your earnings as an STR operator. I hope that was helpful. Just remember AirBNB is not the end all be all of STR. Dont put all your eggs in one basket or youll be in major trouble if you somehow run afoul of the platform. It is well known that AirBNB has wrongfully suspended accounts for no good reason because a bot flagged something.
hloicvo,DegaussedMixtape,2021-11-22 14:16:01,7,12,With 14% total fees.  If you charge 100$/night on airbnb you make $97 and your guest pays $110.  With \~3% fees from stripe or other payment processor.  If you charge $105/night on your private listing website you make $102  and the guest pays $105.  This is beneficial for the guest and the host.
hloketx,troutscockholster,2021-11-22 14:29:49,11,7,Make sure you have outside security cameras. You still need to send someone to spotcheck the unit occasionally. Things go missing/ get broken and no one reports it.
hlomop3,seattle_architect,2021-11-22 14:45:14,2,8,Ask them to cancel and promise refund your payout if place will be rebook.
hlomyjx,richdrifter,2021-11-22 14:47:06,1,14,Yeah. Try being a guest searching for a flat and Airbnb fakes scarcity. Its such shit. How often Ill move the map a touch and BAM! so many listings suddenly appear where there were none 30 seconds ago.
hlon69p,ExtraGuacAM,2021-11-22 14:48:31,2,8,I was thinking about doing this - thanks for the advice!
hlonb3m,Logical_Radio2866,2021-11-22 14:49:25,6,8,Why is it sooooo hard to read? I just dont understand why this world has so many stupid people in it!!!!
hlonrxj,ExtraGuacAM,2021-11-22 14:52:31,1,8,THIS lol.     The extra annoying thing is we arent an instant book listing. He had to go through the entire request process as well without reading the listing or looking at photos.
hloppx7,Daves_Not_Here_OK,2021-11-22 15:05:30,1,12,Who owns your customer? You or Airbnb?  We keep in touch with our guests after their stay and are OK whichever platform they prefer to book on. Some prefer paying the extra fees for the piece of mind.  However what if Airbnb goes away or decided your listing is no longer worthy? You need to have a relationship if you want repeat bookings which (for us) is the best.
hloql1x,beaconpropmgmt,2021-11-22 15:11:17,14,8,Non refundable?  They need to cancel and move on.  Dear Guest  Thank you for letting us know our guest suite no longer suits your needs.  We hope you find the perfect stay elsewhere.  Unfortunately we are unable to offer any refunds outside of the agreed upon policy.  We do our best to clearly disclose all important property info house rules and cancellation policy before a guest confirms their booking request to avoid any concerns. Please follow the instructions below to process your cancellation and your insurance provider will then be able to assist with any claims.  https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/169/how-do-i-cancel-my-reservation-for-a-place-to-stay  Ill get downvoted but when someone agrees to request a booking they have to agree to everything.  https://imgur.com/a/TMAMRzv
hlot5kg,ChristinaWSalemOR,2021-11-22 15:28:32,3,12,If youre processing credit cards youll pay about 3% in fees plus whatever youre spending on your website.   Many hosts offer a direct book to guests who have already stayed so there is a relationship & trust. Back in the day when Airbnb was a yurt in a dirty hippies backyard I was mailing checks to vacation homeowners who advertised on Homeaway. If you have the guest sign an agreement they have legal recourse as does the host.   Im working on this myself-- just reactivated my VRBO listing and already have 2 bookings from there with a 3rd pending in just a few weeks. Im for not putting all my eggs in the Airbnb basket.
hlour6h,bigmike1877,2021-11-22 15:39:18,1,12,This. You could get some bs safety claim from a neighbor and poof your listing is gone.
hloz11m,bigmike1877,2021-11-22 16:09:07,1,48,What are some tools you use for contract signing and ID verification? I live about an hour from my rental
hlp03kq,beaconpropmgmt,2021-11-22 16:16:43,2,48,We ID and have contracts signed in person since it keeps people more honest when they have a face to put with the contract and the identification process but there are many online services available for signing contracts.  Some hosts require guests submit IDs over the platform. Guests can black out personal info and prove they are who they say they are with ID at arrival when in front of doorbell cameras. Hiring great neighbors is a huge benefit to your business.
hlp0iq8,picardoverkirk,2021-11-22 16:19:46,1,48,Hi  /u/beaconpropmgmt  Very well said as usual! Would you mind expanding on your statement can you give us an example of how they have saved you money and how the interactions go with Airbnb.   Also if you wouldnt mind could you link me to your contract in DMs  I would love to see what you wrote!
hlp0y0u,bigmike1877,2021-11-22 16:22:46,1,48,I do require them to have Id confirmed through Airbnb. I‚Äôm new at this any other tips that you hold as very important?
hlp2omc,beaconpropmgmt,2021-11-22 16:35:24,4,48,Hey there my wonderful friend!  Hope you are well!  To elaborate when guests tried to sue us that contract was readily available to nip it in the bud with their attorney before it ever reached a court.  Its also helped us avoid parties rule violations disrespectful guests etc. When they meet us and sign a contract they realize they cant get away with destroying our property or disturbing the community.  They realize that we care about our property and neighbors and they cancel with penalties if they dont like the rules agreed to at booking.   They realize we use security equipment and sweet neighbors who care to ensure we maintain the integrity of our home and the community.  When that kid drowned in the pool cameras and the contract protected us from the liability that would have been on our shoulders.  When guests ripped out our security system that contract protected us and allowed us to take them to court over a poor review and damages.  When we had bodily injuries on property it helped us cover their injuries and protected us from losing our business.  Those are only a few examples but its just so dangerous to allow strangers on your property without a written contract.
hlp2sbz,jpnoa,2021-11-22 16:36:09,4,9,You can setup an online store pretty cheaply and easily with Shopify or Square that also has a POS system for in-person transactions. You could then fulfill online sales with shipping pickup-only leave in rental or all of the above. A Gift Shop would probably be a lot of work though if you dont expect a decent amount of revenue and/or good margins.
hlp348s,mindfulestdude,2021-11-22 16:38:31,4,48,Been doing this a year fully booked screen guests and have higher than avg rates your good. Install ring doorbells and monitor them and I haven‚Äôt had a issue ever.
hlp3mny,beaconpropmgmt,2021-11-22 16:42:11,1,48,Thats so vital!  Thank you for being a responsible host.  The contract is an added layer of legal protection.  People dont realize the importance of screening and monitoring.  One would think we are protected by these sites but we arent completely covered.:-(
hlp3qn5,mindfulestdude,2021-11-22 16:42:58,-1,48,Yes I am fully prepared to be 100% responsible for costs with no Airbnb help just gotta attract good people with good energy into listing.
hlp40j8,Dondondadda,2021-11-22 16:44:59,0,48,Do you take a copy of the guests Id or do you just look at it?
hlp4lsi,beaconpropmgmt,2021-11-22 16:49:17,4,48,I am not required to keep a copy so I just view them to ensure they match the faces & names they provide at booking.  I try to treat guests the way I want to be treated and would be a bit weirded out by a host who wants a physical copy of all sensitive info. I treat it like an ABC store employee.  I just want to see they are who they say they are and that they are of the appropriate age to stay.
hlp7shb,beaconpropmgmt,2021-11-22 17:12:41,2,48,Honestly.... great screening IDing utilizing good surveillance and good rental contracts are a hosts best friend.   I have pretty great guests but as Ive mentioned before it takes a bit of screening and hand holding to deal with the new breed of guests we are dealt with.  I think we are all more honest when we know we can and will be held accountable.  These vacation rental sites have drawn out the worst since the pandemic.  The only one who will truly protect you is yourself.
hlp945g,ciruj,2021-11-22 17:22:40,1,48,DocuSign is a good one to use if you cant be there when someone is checking in. A picture of their ID too. Obviously they could still have someone else show up to stay but I feel like most people wont sign a contract if they wont be staying there since theyre putting themselves out there further with a contract.
hlp9lpm,beaconpropmgmt,2021-11-22 17:26:14,2,48,Do you do the free or paid docusign?
hlp9wz8,ciruj,2021-11-22 17:28:33,2,48,My company has the paid version. I just use that with their permission. Ive never used it outside of that so I dont know what the free option gives you.   It has been very convenient since we travel for work and we cant always be there.
hlpa84e,beaconpropmgmt,2021-11-22 17:30:54,2,48,I use the paid for other docs but the free has seemed to work well for others too.  Thanks so much for your reply!
hlpajs5,ciruj,2021-11-22 17:33:20,1,48,Happy to help!
hlpaoz3,ThatsMrRemyToYou,2021-11-22 17:34:25,1,9,Thanks for the tip! Do you have things for sale for your guests? I‚Äôm not interested in doing it if it doesn‚Äôt bring in a good side revenue stream obviously. But the beauty of the bath products is that they have a very long shelf life and I‚Äôm already using them. Plus I get them at wholesale.
hlpdcor,pakot22,2021-11-22 17:54:49,0,48,Would you mind DMing me the contract? Would love to implement this
hlpf284,jpnoa,2021-11-22 18:08:05,1,9,No problem! I do not and Im new to hosting but I develop and manage ecommerce websites for a living. I know what goes into the online portion and its a lot. Add in brick & mortar and it would be a gigantic time suck but potentially worth it depending on margins/revenue.
hlpfi3e,bigmike1877,2021-11-22 18:11:36,2,48,What are you doing for screening? Asking about why they are traveling etc??
hlpford,bigmike1877,2021-11-22 18:13:04,-1,48,Thanks!!  Is there a template str contract all you guys are using?  Also when do you prompt the guest to sign? What if they don‚Äôt respond or refuse?
hlpfx6t,jpnoa,2021-11-22 18:14:56,1,9,Another way could be hotel style and put them up for sale with pricing in the units. If they take them figure out payment separately or possibly deduct it from the security deposit if everyones in agreement.
hlphxhb,ciruj,2021-11-22 18:30:49,2,48,We do it at booking then the day before we send a copy again. My g/f found one and modified it to fit our situation. She handles that end of things sending and receiving. If no answer or refusal we decline them. They know before we accept that were going to require a signed agreement and ID verification.
hlpkjjj,chwilliaruns,2021-11-22 18:51:29,10,48,Well over 1000 guests and Ive been perfectly happy with Airbnb verifying their ID and the guest agreeing to my contact when they book.  No need to do it in person or have an actual signed copy.
hlpnbqw,36in36,2021-11-22 19:13:30,9,48,Same.  My average stay is a day and a half.  I cant imagine having a guest sign an additional contract.  Seems like the platform should be a simple alternative to a hotel.  These extra layers probably confuse the average guest and turn them off to Airbnb.
hlpo8ci,troutscockholster,2021-11-22 19:20:47,-1,48,I think it depends what type of Airbnb you run. For my casita it seems like overkill. For a more expensive property it seems like it‚Äôs best to CYA
hlppihd,chwilliaruns,2021-11-22 19:30:50,2,48,Why would it matter?  The platform handles custom contracts for you and their ID validation is better than anything you can do on your own.  The only thing you can do better is actually check their ID on arrival but making copies of it makes no sense since the platform already has.
hlpq1du,payyourbillstoday,2021-11-22 19:34:56,-1,48,Are you talking about long term?
hlpqz5s,picardoverkirk,2021-11-22 19:42:08,1,48,Thank you for once again taking the time to help others! It is always appreciated!
hlps1lr,superduperhosts,2021-11-22 19:50:22,2,48,>Why would it matter?   If your guests turns off the cameras and empties your place out and you do not have  their ID AirBnb will NOT share it without a court order/police request.  So there is that.
hlpseh7,picardoverkirk,2021-11-22 19:53:06,1,48,No STR rentals means Short Term Rental.
hlpspdn,36in36,2021-11-22 19:55:25,4,48,...and then the flood and the locusts start eating the crops.    EDIT: probably shouldnt be so flippant sorry.  Just think this probably happens in 1 out of 500000 stays.
hlpsqn5,TacoWallace,2021-11-22 19:55:42,1,48,What protections does a rental agreement provide that they don‚Äôt agree to via Airbnb?  Where‚Äôs your property and what kind is it? What‚Äôs your normal clientele like?  Why did you get sued?
hlpv68d,tnitty,2021-11-22 20:14:20,1,48,>Ill be DV as usual but its an important question.  What is DV?
hlpvhqk,bigmike1877,2021-11-22 20:16:49,2,48,Thanks !!
hlpw1a5,beaconpropmgmt,2021-11-22 20:21:06,2,48,DV= downvoted.  Im quite blunt and honest in efforts to help others in these subs and am downvoted often.  Doesnt really bother me but its expected from the folks who dont value truthful observations.
hlpwkta,tnitty,2021-11-22 20:25:21,2,48,Thanks. I should have figured that out.
hlpy3ky,MungeDiver,2021-11-22 20:37:16,1,48,I would never sign a rental contract to stay at an AirBnB.
hlpzasc,beaconpropmgmt,2021-11-22 20:46:46,1,48,No worries.  You just dont have to stay if you agree to it at booking. Those rental contracts are what protect hosts and guests.  Thank you for your input.
hlq0cel,MungeDiver,2021-11-22 20:55:00,2,48,Yeah 100% would not rent from you.
hlq0rzx,beaconpropmgmt,2021-11-22 20:58:28,1,48,Thank you!!!üëãüëãüëã This saves me time energy and court cases.  I appreciate you moving on to hosts who dont value or care about their property neighbors or future.  Feel free to review policies on contracts.  https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/465/if-a-host-asks-you-to-sign-a-contract
hlq135j,MungeDiver,2021-11-22 21:00:51,1,48,I think your attitude might cause the court cases tbh.
hlq3uz4,beaconpropmgmt,2021-11-22 21:22:58,-1,48,How many court and insurance cases have you dealt with? Though we have great policies and good $5mil umbrella policies we have still dealt with our fair share of nightmares.  Am happy to take any suggestions from your personal attorney and broker to help us and other hosts protect themselves.
hlq5csb,superduperhosts,2021-11-22 21:35:08,2,48,I was exaggerating but still.  Hotels ask for ID for a reason
hlq9m8y,sweeet_as_pie,2021-11-22 22:11:03,0,48,They do not have proper Id verification. Ive had numerous guests book with just a first initial and it shows as ID verified on their profile. Thats when I ask for an ID.
hlq9s46,MLB0511,2021-11-22 22:12:27,1,12,New host here‚Ä¶ do you have any recommendations for tools to sync up calendars?
hlqa9n5,MLB0511,2021-11-22 22:16:48,1,3,New host here. Do you mind sharing the PMS you use?
hlqd4dk,jarcher2828,2021-11-22 22:43:08,1,18,I would add if there is a Local Management company give them a ring and ask about what they take care of and what they dont and what permits you will need...they normally have it all ready and are able to give you details of what required for STRs in the area...in their list it will show the permitting requirements and process.
hlqecpu,Dondondadda,2021-11-22 22:54:59,0,48,I guess some hosts dont identify/ ID check guests because they live far from their Airbnb. How do hosts verify ID when they are operating their Airbnb remotely?
hlqf53p,Routine_Echo_186,2021-11-22 23:02:47,2,12,Yes i completely understand now. Thank You in your experience how often do you get repeat guests? So what do you do about damages caused by guests? is there some other form of insurance for you as a host? what if you run into a squatter?
hlqgz34,T-rex_with_a_gun,2021-11-22 23:21:10,0,48,then you file a claim with airbnb....
hlqi9q6,AwkwardlyAmbitious,2021-11-22 23:34:28,3,14,Washer for sure. A different shwasher is far less needed for a 2 person stay but a washer adds attraction for longer term trips.
hlqj0i1,mtvcc,2021-11-22 23:42:15,3,14,Those all in one washer dryer units are suspect. They only do very small loads and my guess is guest would overload them causing a lot of repair calls.
hlqjy27,ParkSloperator,2021-11-22 23:52:14,3,14,I get that but our track record with guests over the last 10 years has been absolutely fantastic so if I can switch to the w/d and leave very specific instructions Im inclined to go for it. I hear what you are saying but we live on property which I think makes a difference? Anyway curious to hear what other hosts have to say if they have the all-in-one.
hlqo91i,twitch_delta_blues,2021-11-23 00:41:10,12,14,As a guest I‚Äôd want a washer and dryer long before a dish washer. As a host it‚Äôs a selling point. There‚Äôs no co rest!
hlqonra,AmbitionStrong5602,2021-11-23 00:46:06,6,14,The all in washer and dryer units take about 4 hrs for one load. Unless something has changed recently. Definitely wouldnt want to use one of those to clean linen between guests
hlqtp8a,No_Gas_All_Ass,2021-11-23 01:50:33,2,14,I would like to vote for the washer/dryer option please.  I do have a few questions though...  What is the leak damage risk assessment and mitigation plan? Is this the apartment ground level or an elevated floor? Has a noise pollution environmental impact study been scheduled? What is the cost of creating the infrastructure to support this project and are they consistent with this years economic outlook?  My girl does raise an interesting point though... Its the - If it aint broke why fix it argument. Do you get bookings now? Will it get you more bookings? Its going to raise your operating costs. Does it matter at all really?
hlr5rla,Angryceo,2021-11-23 04:46:42,1,2,New payouts are held for 30 days.  Are you a new account?
hlr6uny,GiGoVX,2021-11-23 05:01:57,4,14,Washer dryer for the win IMHO. Get one that condenses its self and flushes the water down the drain the one I got also does an 8kg load which is perfect for a 2 people.
hlreanw,superduperhosts,2021-11-23 06:33:22,0,48,Lol you must be new here
hlrkodf,Specialist-codpiece,2021-11-23 07:34:53,3,7,Make sure there is a backup emergency key somewhere.    Get a smart thermostat so you can turn the heating up and down or off from an app on your phone.   Get a plan for dealing with your trash/rubbish.
hlrvkfl,Unlikely-Collar4088,2021-11-23 09:01:27,1,14,a washer/dryer combo will never ever EVER get your stuff 100% dry. youll want to leave them out for 20-30 minutes at least. Plus they take forever.  like >5 hours for a wash/dry cycle.  I had one for half a decade becase the space saving is a huge advantage but damn is it frustrating to wait 6+ hours for a load and then have it be damp.
hlrvmiz,Unlikely-Collar4088,2021-11-23 09:01:52,2,14,mine was even worse lol.  6+ hours for a full cycle.
hlrxskv,troutscockholster,2021-11-23 09:17:41,2,48,Imagine having 3-5 different guests a week with a tiny studio or casita on your own property. You really want to send each one an additional contract? I‚Äôve had one person damage my place out of over a hundred and Airbnb paid me with host guarantee. It doesn‚Äôt seem like the contract would be worth it for my casita.
hlrxxec,troutscockholster,2021-11-23 09:18:40,1,48,I‚Äôve had one claim and it was paid. If you follow the procedure you‚Äôll get paid
hlrzywu,Luebe,2021-11-23 09:33:00,1,14,Dishwasher is definitely better. Your guests are eating and drinking making dirty dishes. If you have good dishwasher it is using very little water and electricity and your plates and cups are clean... not like after some guests just wishy-washy rinse the coffee mugs... If you now provide washer/dryer your guests still need to wash the dirty dishes. Now you have double water bill.  I can manage one week holidays without needing to do laundry but clean cups I like every day.  One other thing...at home I make sure I dont wash few T-shirts etc trying to have full loads. I have seen people washing their runners pair of jeans or one party dress in full size of washing machine when its not their own.
hls07z6,ParkSloperator,2021-11-23 09:34:44,1,14,Its not for me to wash linens - I have my own washer and dryer upstairs. Its just an extra guest amenity.  A few people have asked recently if we have a washer/dryer in unit which is why Im thinking about it.
hls22ql,IncaThink,2021-11-23 09:47:21,2,14,I have two listings in the same building but the map showed them in wildly different parts of the city. One was very posh and the other was rather down-market and neither was going to make any potential guests happy with the actual location.  I had to enable the setting that allows Airbnb to show my exact address. It was the only thing that worked.  This was after numerous conversations with wildly different answers and also a few demonstrations that they CAN change where my location is displayed. They just cannot really be bothered. Im still bitter.
hls2g9c,IncaThink,2021-11-23 09:49:55,2,14,You might have to enable the setting that allows them to display your exact actual location. Not ideal but better than being off the map on (literally) the wrong side of the tracks.
hls3j2c,TheGoodRobot,2021-11-23 09:57:09,0,14,dooooont do it. I researched the same thing. they‚Äôre terrible at drying- it takes forever. they also break down way faster and are hella expensive to repair comparatively.
hls3ylt,ianzabel,2021-11-23 10:00:05,1,9,Curious about what products youre using. Im just setting up an Airbnb in Vermont and were trying to figure out the bath products situation.
hls4lyt,IncaThink,2021-11-23 10:04:32,2,8,My script is something like this: When you booked you chose the discounted non refundable option. Many people are happy with this. But it does not make business sense for me to accept a lower price for our location and then also agree to a refund later on. But I will be happy to refund any amount I am able to recover with another booking t these. Please know that the sooner you cancel the better chance i have to get a new booking.  Also depending on how nice they have been during the process i might add this: Please know that I will be happy to apply any amount I receive from your cancellation to a future booking for you.
hls4vwp,ExtraGuacAM,2021-11-23 10:06:25,1,8,This is well worded! thanks for this response. I might use something like it.
hls9o3f,advokatethis,2021-11-23 10:38:42,1,14,So I tried that and no luck. Airbnb support said its a known problem multiple people are having and there is no ETA for a fix! They said they are closing my case and will contact me when its fixed. I said why would my case be closed if it isnt fixed yet and two support people said because its no longer a support issue its an engineering/technical problem. Lovely.
hls9tof,advokatethis,2021-11-23 10:39:44,1,14,Update: Airbnb support said its a known problem multiple people are having and there is no ETA for a fix! They said they are closing my case and will contact me when its fixed. I said why would my case be closed if it isnt fixed yet and two support people said because its no longer a support issue its an engineering/technical problem. I may consider moving my listing to VRBO.
hlsanyl,yourheynis,2021-11-23 10:45:15,1,13,I cant if they cancel and are no longer a guest
hlsgib2,Aprioribox,2021-11-23 11:22:47,1,14,Get a washer and a basic drying rack. Super useful as a guest.
hlsh4io,Gold-Comfortable-453,2021-11-23 11:26:44,1,48,You really should have a signed contract. When something goes wrong you will be glad you did. Think of it like car insurance - you dont plan to have an accident but you wouldnt drive without it. Many easy online programs that allow a guest to sign online. Its part of my house rules and I send it directly after they book & also have a generic copy on the website for them to ok prior to booking.
hlsjnte,tstock,2021-11-23 11:42:49,1,14,Depends on where the Airbnb is and who your guests are. Europeans have lived with unvented combo units for decades and would like a washer/dryer in the house. Yay! As you have read in other posts the typical American absolutely hates (with passion) combo unvented units and those are only seen in the US in cheap rentals and some modern eco-friendly tight envelope houses.  &#x200B  tldr If you buy a combo unvented combo unit and the guest is american youre not getting 5 stars.
hlsojwr,robanywhere,2021-11-23 12:14:18,1,9,You might consider having the products displayed with information to purchase directly from the vendor. Then make an arrangement whereby you could get a commission from the seller if your name is mentioned during the sale etc. I see this occasionally where a host might recommend an Experience nearby restaurant etc.
hlsr3fu,sensicalanalogys,2021-11-23 12:30:54,3,5,Nope‚Ä¶
hlsvg24,ParkSloperator,2021-11-23 12:58:47,1,9,If the products are really great I would consider placing some of them in your units for guest use and leave a sign that they are also available for purchase.  I fell in love with some bath products at our hotel in Hawaii and love them so much I order frequently.
hlt4x2r,Cunny1989,2021-11-23 14:00:52,0,5,Ya I noticed it. What do you think is a fair rate?
hlt5yq4,RokBo67,2021-11-23 14:07:45,2,10,https://www.livingspaces.com/pdp-linday-park-queen-sofa-sleeper-223375?productId=223375  This one has worked extremely well. It goes in and out of stock all the time. Just set up an email notification for the product.   Its the first piece of furniture in my life that made me feel like it was underpriced even though I paid full retail. Theres a pretty good amount of product reviews to help inform your research.  It is heavy as hell and I have zero regrets about paying the $99 installation and haul away especially if you have stairs.
hltbupv,corey_55,2021-11-23 14:46:22,1,2,No - we are a Super Host that transitioned our payment details. It has been well over 30 days.
hltdknb,brucegoose03,2021-11-23 14:57:34,0,13,I‚Äôm curious about this too. In my setup I have a private room in my house so I‚Äôd know I‚Äôd they smoked. But if we were away on vaca and we detected smoke it‚Äôd be nice to have it recorded digitally and auto-charge them.  If anyone finds any good models for this I‚Äôd be interested to look
hltflcz,ChristinaWSalemOR,2021-11-23 15:10:39,6,10,Ikea Friheten. I have the one with the lounge.
hltg2od,bigmike1877,2021-11-23 15:13:49,0,13,Interested if these work as well. Anyone know of one that works?
hltgyu6,lift0ff,2021-11-23 15:19:39,9,7,\#ad
hlthecm,Maybe_Black_Mesa,2021-11-23 15:22:30,7,7,Interesting that 40% more is exactly what the website says youll make with professional photos.   Your declaration would be believable if you showed us some before and after shots instead you come off like youre trying to shill for your new business.
hltiryh,Gumbeaux_,2021-11-23 15:31:40,3,7,hey if you‚Äôre gonna shill for some company at least make it sound believable when you do it. we‚Äôre not idiots
hltjbt8,Hurly64,2021-11-23 15:35:15,3,13,To really get rid of the smell you would have to repaint each room that was smoked in clean the drapes clean the carpet.  What am I missing. It could easily cost $1000+.   I would have no problem stating that sort of fine upfront in the contract.
hltjkz5,Angryceo,2021-11-23 15:36:58,0,7,At least the account is a year old
hltjrat,tylerblaylock1,2021-11-23 15:38:09,-1,7,Lol
hltmpg6,A_Beach_Guy,2021-11-23 15:57:36,1,7,40% ?   Really?   [Cross your heart](https://youtu.be/4r8gFXCyxiY)?
hltnju6,troutscockholster,2021-11-23 16:03:13,3,13,If you are that serious collect the security deposit as other have mentioned. You can also send them a No Smoking Addendum to sign and send back so they know you are serious.
hlty329,Its-a-write-off,2021-11-23 17:17:51,3,12,A 1099 has nothing to do with how you report for local sales tax.   A 1099 is just a record of payments processed for you. You dont need a 1099 to file as you can track your total processed payments yourself.
hltyccl,Farrell_Pool_Jack,2021-11-23 17:19:47,1,12,My question then should be how do you report to your state that Airbnb has collected and remitted taxes for you.  Is there a document that can be submitted?
hltyi99,Its-a-write-off,2021-11-23 17:20:58,1,12,Yes its part of your sales and use filing. Like in my state I list gross sales then deduct any sales that the platform auto collected and remitted for already.
hltyxgo,antiauthoritarian123,2021-11-23 17:24:04,1,7,Says Mr fotobnb himself
hltyzfk,Farrell_Pool_Jack,2021-11-23 17:24:28,1,12,Thanks that helps.  I have all my sales go through Airbnb since it‚Äôs easier to keep track of and they submit state tax for me.
hlu96yc,antiauthoritarian123,2021-11-23 18:42:27,0,12,Pretty sure they stopped providing 1099 a few years ago... Export out the Excel file for year of 2021 give to accountant and file
hlu9ww9,Farrell_Pool_Jack,2021-11-23 18:48:08,0,12,Does the exported file contain a field with the amount collected and remitted for state sales tax?
hlucbci,A_Beach_Guy,2021-11-23 19:06:51,5,12,Sales Tax and Transient Occupancy Tax are not the same as nor do they have anything in common with Income Tax.    A business reports payments it makes to non-employees or independent contractors on a form 1099-MISC to the Federal Government.    You as a *Business* collect Sales and Transient Occupancy Taxes from your guest and forward those tax dollars to State and Local Government on a monthly basis.  Because so many people operating their business via the AirBnB platform were failing to collect and forward Sales and Transient Occupancy Taxes to the appropriate Government Agencies and State and Local Governments were threatening to shut AirBnB down AirBnB *voluntarily* began collecting and forwarding those taxes on behalf of Hosts years ago.  You are still obligated to collect and forward Sales and Transient Occupancy Taxes on all bookings made outside the AirBnB Platform.  You are still obligated to report all income you receive to State and Federal Government and to pay taxes on that income.
hludczf,Farrell_Pool_Jack,2021-11-23 19:15:05,-1,12,Thanks for the response.  I have all my bookings through Airbnb.  Airbnb remits the state sales tax and I pay the local tax myself.  I‚Äôm just looking to confirm that if all my bookings are through Airbnb and they remit the state sales tax then I‚Äôm ok reporting zero sales to the state.  I‚Äôm going to talk to a tax guy either this week or next week to confirm.  Just trying to be proactive.
hludznr,superduperhosts,2021-11-23 19:20:04,7,10,Just don‚Äôt.  They all suck You don‚Äôt want extra bodies in the space  Singles and couples the best guests
hlufwdh,eyewhycue2,2021-11-23 19:35:09,1,9,I use shampoo bars and slice them in thirds and put in small wax paper bags and offer at no charge.
hlugydx,A_Beach_Guy,2021-11-23 19:43:15,2,12,Talk to your State Sales Tax Office and ask *them* how to file.
hluh733,interestsallround,2021-11-23 19:45:10,2,10,We ordered ours through Interior Define and are very pleased. The lead time is a few months unfortunately but was worth the wait.
hlukhk5,interestsallround,2021-11-23 20:10:54,1,9,Ive thought about something similar with art....the artist gets a free place to store extra pieces and opportunities at extra sales. People like to spend money when they travel!
hluo8ts,Sandvik95,2021-11-23 20:40:35,5,10,This ‚¨ÜÔ∏è. In my opinion adding a pull out won‚Äôt get you the additional renters you want it will only get you additional renters you don‚Äôt want.   We keep a firm cap on the number of guests (1 guest for each bed space) and we don‚Äôt even entertain the ‚Äú$XX more for extra guests‚Äù approach. Not worth the added wear and tear on our rental.
hluowph,Zmyslinski,2021-11-23 20:45:53,2,10,Id sleep on a decent air mattress over a fold out couch any day.
hlus46c,winosaur88,2021-11-23 21:11:09,3,10,I third this opinion. I have a pullout couch in my living room since I‚Äôve already purchased it but I don‚Äôt advertise it anymore.
hluskm3,eyewhycue2,2021-11-23 21:14:51,1,62,I wonder also if you could accommodate and mention that guest can leave a tip for exceptional hosting. üòâ
hlusuks,RokBo67,2021-11-23 21:17:07,0,7,Cameras  Smart thermostat  Great cleaners and reliable backup and backup to the backup  Primary and alternate handyman  Solid contact info for immediate neighbors for various reasons  A backup plan for placing guests in a comparable Airbnb if something catastrophic happened during their stay  Custom news alerts for events in your area and any city hall talk if banning or altering short term rentals.   Interview a couple full time property managers in case something catastrophic happens in your life so you can immediately turn it over to them for a few months if you need  Just a few quick ideas.
hlv9yrn,ConfidenceAsleep3795,2021-11-23 23:49:31,1,10,I agree most sleeper sofas suck. Try to find one of the ones where the couch turns into a bed vs a bed pulling out. They‚Äôre not as springy/bumpy. We have one that we found on offerup for $300 it‚Äôs pretty firm but we put a full size memory foam mattress topper inside the storage compartment chaise so that our guests can throw that on top. We cover the topper with a white duvet (twin size so that it fits in snug) which is great because it doubles as a sheet and we can just wash it after each use.

hlvp5ac,Callipeartree,2021-11-24 02:47:29,2,5,My rental has always been pet friendly. I‚Äôm frankly happy the pet fee has finally been integrated into the booking system. I charge $100 per stay to bring one pet (dogs only). Plus $25 to bring each additional.   But it seems that Airbnb still managed to fuck this up by limiting hosts to charge per stay as well as not including a box/search filter for pet free.
hlvuzr5,brucegoose03,2021-11-24 04:09:39,1,13,Do you have a separate sheet that has those things? How do you do that?
hlw93up,brokencompass502,2021-11-24 06:59:25,-1,13,If a guest smokes in your house ONCE you are going to paint the walls in each room that was smoked in and clean the carpet? Holy shit this sub never disappoints with delusional drunk-with-power hosts so damn eager to make their guests bow and cry in front of their almighty rule book.   Get a fucking grip people. Post a no smoking sign in the house and just check the no smoking allowed box on your listing. The End.
hlweo2m,lordito,2021-11-24 07:50:11,1,13,That ballpark amount is commonplace if you get caught smoking in a no smoking hotel room or similar.
hlwjavc,flightgirl78,2021-11-24 08:27:21,2,14,Do both - vrbo and Airbnb.
hlwkqrz,teoalcola,2021-11-24 08:38:15,2,13,I dont think that holds up in court.
hlwlhbm,flightgirl78,2021-11-24 08:43:47,0,3,Hiya folks! What kinds of cameras and noise detection devices do you use? And is anyone planning upgrade purchases during Black Friday sales? I searched Reddit (useless) and trying to find similar posts using Google doesn‚Äôt even work it returns results of scary hidden cameras that sketchy hosts placed in bathroom cupboards smoke detectors etc.  I‚Äôm wondering what you use for your exterior monitoring systems.  Thanks and happy hosting!
hlwlspg,flightgirl78,2021-11-24 08:46:09,2,7,Which smart thermostat do you use/like?
hlwlv3h,flightgirl78,2021-11-24 08:46:39,1,7,Which cameras do you like? Which thermostat? Do you use any of the online apps for booking the cleaners?
hlwlxqh,flightgirl78,2021-11-24 08:47:11,1,1,Yes. I will pm you.
hlwpa9z,RokBo67,2021-11-24 09:10:54,1,7,I like the Nest ecosystem but its all down to your own personal opinion.   I dont use software to schedule my cleaners.
hlwwthi,Specialist-codpiece,2021-11-24 10:02:33,1,7,I got hive. Really good.  Can have full control of the heating just from my phone from anywhere. It will pay for itself in savings on energy for sure.
hlwwy6y,lordito,2021-11-24 10:03:27,0,13,Why not? Id imagine its in the T&Cs you agree to when you book a hotel.
hlwz8zs,JelloBrickRoad,2021-11-24 10:18:57,1,2,SmartBNB was always amazing. Never tried the others
hlxiav2,teoalcola,2021-11-24 12:23:20,2,13,Many hotels do not have such specific T&C and even if they did theres a good chance a court would consider it abusive to ask for a 1000 dollar penalty for smoking once in a hotel room with no permanent damage done to the room. Of course this may vary from one legal system to another. Im from Europe it could be different in the USA.
hlxif47,ChristinaWSalemOR,2021-11-24 12:24:06,2,12,Hi you can export a file that shows taxes that Airbnb collected for you and your gross revenue etc. Go to Insights Earnings Transaction History and choose the Gross Earnings tab. Then download the CSV file. The county where I have to file my taxes accepts this report for the quarterly return.
hlxj6xl,Angryceo,2021-11-24 12:29:05,1,2,... Do you have an API setup with airbnb?
hlxjgsr,ChristinaWSalemOR,2021-11-24 12:30:50,1,2,OMG yes I do! I am trialing a channel manager. I totally forgot and did not realize it would prohibit editing from the website.
hly8489,Farrell_Pool_Jack,2021-11-24 15:12:25,1,12,This is exactly what I was looking to give my tax guy. Thank you
hlya2bl,ChristinaWSalemOR,2021-11-24 15:25:34,1,12,You bet!!
hlye96l,heybrahbrahh,2021-11-24 15:53:36,1,2,To add to the question - vs OwneRez?
hlyh1r2,sirp1nky,2021-11-24 16:11:52,1,6,Im trying to say stuff like: no parties no pets etc... stuff like that. the listing wizard doesnt let me do that...
hlyj2en,Supreme_Pikachu_,2021-11-24 16:25:08,1,10,I just got one for my unit from Bob discount furniture. It was $2200 and the full mattress feel amazing  I got a queen size. This include a 5 years damage insurance for anything ‚Äúaccidents‚Äù. I get what others say about the pull out couch option here but for me the unit I have is for family come visits near by facility not vacation or recreation traveling so this option give family a bit more room for their buck.   Now most furniture you buy has a long wait time  2-3 months ‚Ä¶
hlzu8ky,dqngqlqk,2021-11-24 22:22:57,1,6,Those things should go to Additional rules section https://www.airbnb.com/manage-your-space/YOUR-LISTING-ID-HERE/policies-and-rules
hm163r5,roadrunner713,2021-11-25 07:32:45,1,5,No I cant find it anywhere...is this being rolled out to different markets at different dates?
hm17lev,No_Gas_All_Ass,2021-11-25 07:46:54,1,3,Nest.   Wyze.
hm1a7ef,Treetatoe,2021-11-25 08:11:00,1,3,I went with a eufy security set off Amazon for a couple hundred bucks. Came with a home base and 2 cameras (eufycam 2C‚Äôs). Easy to install no subscription fees and has worked very well for us. Actually just bought another set for a second property a few months ago. Only had the first one a little over a year but so far so good.
hm1diz5,Mkwatt,2021-11-25 08:39:17,3,6,If I remember correctly back when I did my listing they only allow you to include the basic description at first and then once it gets listed all of the other categories become available to you. Not sure why they do that.
hm1ozfb,ElectronicFarm1314,2021-11-25 10:07:41,2,6,Yeah it is the most annoying thing you have to actually make your listing live to get access to all these sections.
hm1u0yj,GiGoVX,2021-11-25 10:43:58,2,6,OP take a look at a few other listings in your local are and check out there list of house rules.  I didnt do this when we listed our place at first and after our first guest that we were very un-happy with I was told to change my rules as it pretty much just said no parties please treat the house with respect so biggest advice I can offer about the listing aside from having nice photos is to make sure you rules are thought out. We only starting listing about 2 years ago and we have adjusted a rules a few times when someone does something we hadnt thought about ie no lighting candles no covering the CCTV camera  Good luck!
hm1zse3,Hellsbells247a,2021-11-25 11:24:45,1,17,Yes they are. Sadly its not only guests who dont read. Clearly some hosts here dont read either :)
hm20088,Hellsbells247a,2021-11-25 11:26:14,1,17,If you bothered to read their guidance on the scheme you would see Airbnb are offering compensation for hosts.
hm290qw,sirp1nky,2021-11-25 12:29:00,1,6,That‚Äôs correct- thanks. Very confusing.
hm2qw30,picardoverkirk,2021-11-25 14:37:31,1,13,Why are you focused on them smoking only once? Have you ever known a smoker to only smoke once in days (or whatever length the stay was)?  Also what you maybe are failing to take into account is that if the following guest smells smoke they can get a massive to full refund. So smoking can cost a ton in the end!
hm3317d,missdiggles,2021-11-25 16:13:04,1,17,Well I admit - I just skimmed it. Our property wouldn‚Äôt be ideal for this - it‚Äôs remote to begin with
hm3g1pm,Exotic-Bathturbater,2021-11-25 18:01:13,1,13,A hotel as (ex.) 100 rooms. At any given time the guest staying in a non-smoking room that has been smoked in can be relocated and the room gets Ozoned  It is not abusive to ask for $1000 penalty as it costs $2500 to remove odor from a 1300 sqft \~(250m2) home.   I would send you a screenshot of my $2500 quote to remediate smoke odor from 2 weeks ago but I cant do that with a .pdf. So youll just have to take my word for it.
hm3gbfq,superduperhosts,2021-11-25 18:03:31,7,9,Cameras.  That‚Äôs it.
hm3l17x,oyp,2021-11-25 18:45:03,0,9,Um... an electronic door lock? I host $5 million luxury homes in a ski resort. We never activate the security systems.
hm3l28u,Pretend_Kangaroo_694,2021-11-25 18:45:17,6,9,Ring cameras
hm3l2qn,RokBo67,2021-11-25 18:45:24,1,8,No downvotes! This is perfect.
hm3mwqg,JPhase,2021-11-25 19:01:24,1,9,None.  What do you feel they are for?
hm3yayw,mmmkaaaayyy,2021-11-25 20:41:40,4,9,nah i installed a 16 channel 12TB dvr from Reolink. set came with that and 8 POE cameras up to 8mp i believe. $1000 all in all. can watch from a browser or app for free. only way to go. caught my first ever guest bringing people in she didnt pay for. glad i have them.
hm3yqzc,ChristinaWSalemOR,2021-11-25 20:45:34,1,10,I see your opinion and raise you a 4th. Just recently went from allowing  6 guests in a 2bd with extra sofa bed to 4 total with additional sleeping area.
hm3yvfk,Soyl3ntR3d,2021-11-25 20:46:37,1,9,Which cameras?  I‚Äôve seen folks mention Ring & Reolink?
hm45odh,TheRandomCanuck,2021-11-25 21:47:17,3,1,My manager charges 20% and includes restocking and cleaning.  Honestly though shes not great.... but does the job.
hm4p54z,zulu1239,2021-11-26 01:10:16,1,5,Whatever it costs to do extra cleaning for hosting pets.
hm4u4iy,GiGoVX,2021-11-26 02:12:39,2,9,Depends what you mean by security system? An alarm to sound if there is motion inside when there shouldnt be? Or do you mean CCTV/IP Cameras?
hm509rs,GiGoVX,2021-11-26 03:37:12,18,24,IMHO you are better off looking on forums and reading articles rather than listening to someone and paying for the privledge.  You are very much correct just like with any business you get out what you put in.
hm53rz4,Angryceo,2021-11-26 04:28:08,10,24,99% of these kids pushing their professional classes are barely 18  just reselling someone else‚Äôs work.   Read and ask questions. It‚Äôs all out there. Please don‚Äôt pay someone that doesn‚Äôt have a clue.
hm5c29k,payyourbillstoday,2021-11-26 06:24:13,1,24,There‚Äôs really nothing to it that you need mentorship.  Provide a nice clean place. Reasonable rates. Be nice but don‚Äôt tolerate bullshit and you will grow.
hm5ddkh,heybrahbrahh,2021-11-26 06:40:11,1,24,There are PLENTY of books out there.
hm5e8oy,thatcbcb,2021-11-26 06:50:06,5,24,They are making money off telling you information that is widely available on the internet for free.
hm5fd09,Tenesmus83,2021-11-26 07:02:33,1,9,How about nothing
hm5fdpn,brokencompass502,2021-11-26 07:02:46,7,24,Yeah its just a compilation of Airbnb Lifehacks found on YouTube and Tiktok.   Gets me thinking Ive been doing Airbnb for 12 years maybe I should become a guru?   Sweep BEFORE you mop.   That will be $50 bucks. Come back next week for my class on replacing toilet paper rolls.
hm5gvvh,thatcbcb,2021-11-26 07:19:06,4,24,Right? For $500 I‚Äôll tell you that clean sheets are important and that you should actually have the furniture that you show in your pictures.
hm5isis,jaminty317,2021-11-26 07:38:32,3,24,And create some systems so it‚Äôs easier and automated.   Money please
hm5koec,cruzcontrol8765,2021-11-26 07:56:46,1,24,I dont think paying a mentor is necessary. Just set up a place that you would enjoy staying in yourself make sure its spotless when each guest checks in and price similarly to what you see in your area. Always communicate with guests quickly and courteously. Make sure your photos look good and are accurate. All the little stuff youll learn along the way.
hm5mu85,eeek1970,2021-11-26 08:16:43,5,6,I‚Äôve had one at my airbnb for a few years since I drive an EV also and it‚Äôs only been used once. I didn‚Äôt charge anything for its use since it was only about $2 worth of electricity (old Nissan leave) at the most. I think this will become more of an in demand feature in the future. As far as charging a fee for its use I would factor in the cost of electricity. We pay about 11 cents a kWh and the average EV is between 50-100 kWh capacity. So if someone charges overnight and say uses 60 kWh of electricity it would be about $7 worth of power. I‚Äôm not sure I would charge extra for that but it would depend on your market.
hm5q660,Farrell_Pool_Jack,2021-11-26 08:46:22,1,24,Here‚Äôs the best tip you‚Äôll get.  Unless you clean the Airbnb yourself get the best cleaner you can.  Your cleaner will be your eyes and ears.  A good cleaner is hard to find don‚Äôt just take anyone.  My cleaner also does light handyman jobs and has saved me many times.  Second best tip is don‚Äôt give out the keycodes to the guest until 30 minutes before checkin.  Guests will always try to checkin early.
hm5qj4c,thatcbcb,2021-11-26 08:49:26,4,24,We ought to just charge admission to this sub and split the proceeds. Gurus galore!
hm5t0e0,thegangler,2021-11-26 09:10:04,3,6,I have one in my rental (I have an EV so its useful when Im there). Ive had it about 6 months and have had one rental where they called it out as useful. Dont charge extra but the renter profile is more affluent so theres that.
hm5vorl,slickpapillon,2021-11-26 09:31:45,2,6,I have been a host as well as a guest for a few years now and it never occurred to me but now that I have an electric vehicle myself I would say it‚Äôs important. I just stayed in a place this week and I did not have a charge port so I had to plug into the 110 with the standard charger that came with the car. It‚Äôs really not enough juice. When I charge at home my bill has not gone up significantly I have only noticed at most a $40 increase. I am now going to be adding electric vehicle charging to my listing in but since I don‚Äôt have long-term tenants and my place is usually a weekend retreat I will be including it free of charge.
hm62atk,shlomoww,2021-11-26 10:22:05,1,3,I used to use Airtable for that. But gave up as actually all the stats that I need exist within Airbnb.
hm63e2r,Farrell_Pool_Jack,2021-11-26 10:30:09,1,3,Thanks for the information.  I‚Äôll check it out.
hm65qfg,Peanutbutternbaconn,2021-11-26 10:47:15,1,24,I met my mentor on here. She‚Äôs the best. If you‚Äôre reading this you know who you are ü•∞
hm67psy,Johnsie408,2021-11-26 11:01:36,2,6,As a host and an EV owner I think this is a great idea soon everyone will be looking for this- why not get out ahead of the pack.
hm6cgw0,SwimmingUniqueToo,2021-11-26 11:36:24,2,24,Definitely worth paying gurus $$$$ for advice.  Let me know if you want a link to my course. üòú

hm6l24e,DavePastry,2021-11-26 12:40:15,2,6,I dont think I would pay more for it as a guest but I might take your listing over another one that didnt have it
hm6pwv9,shlomoww,2021-11-26 13:17:52,1,1,You can create a [rule set](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/2062) where you can customize minimum stay by check-in day.
hm6pz23,orincoro,2021-11-26 13:18:22,1,24,What is a guru going to tell you that you won‚Äôt learn in the first 6 months? It‚Äôs not rocket science. Keep a high standard control your costs raise your prices. If it were so hard fewer people would be doing it.
hm6q9gn,orincoro,2021-11-26 13:20:39,1,24,Yeah online education is rife with Charlatans and idiots. Taking 10 paragraphs to say what 1 paragraph will do.
hm6qcms,orincoro,2021-11-26 13:21:19,1,24,And if they were so good at making money in hospitality they would be focusing on that not on selling courses.  That‚Äôs why anybody who wants a hospitality education goes out and learns from people who do it.
hm6qu3c,orincoro,2021-11-26 13:25:07,1,24,The only legit service I can imagine it being worth paying for would be marketing consultation (similar to professional photos professional copy can make a difference to your sales) and then only if you are really having an issue with your market fit like you aren‚Äôt getting as many bookings as you should or your guests are not happy with what they get. 90% of that is getting the experience to know how to sell and find the right people so even if someone gives you perfect photos and perfect copy for your listing you‚Äôre still only 10% of the way there.  Just look at what Airbnb actually pushes people to do and you‚Äôll see what‚Äôs important. Photos amenities price and location. That‚Äôs pretty much all they focus on.
hm6r8xo,orincoro,2021-11-26 13:28:22,1,24,And for another $500 I‚Äôll tell you to get a nespresso machine and Apple TV worry about the sheets being dry and smelling fresh (ironing matters less) and install USB chargers.  And ignore Airbnb‚Äôs pricing recommendations unless you want Johnny Cheapskate and Karen ‚ÄúMy daughter‚Äôs birthday‚Äù to ruin your life.
hm6ris9,orincoro,2021-11-26 13:30:30,1,24,As someone who has done a lot of professional mentoring it‚Äôs sad to say but most people who seek mentoring need a therapist not help figuring out that their walls should be painted white and their sheets should be striped.
hm6rp0v,orincoro,2021-11-26 13:31:50,1,24,There is nothing *wrong* with getting advice but my experience is that Airbnb gives hosts virtually all the support they need as a matter of course.
hm6rtvm,orincoro,2021-11-26 13:32:52,1,24,Only addition (and I‚Äôll take a check please) is to price *above* competing listings in your area. Let the cheapest guests stay somewhere else.
hm6sask,superduperhosts,2021-11-26 13:36:30,1,1,I responded on the other sub.
hm6sxwh,payyourbillstoday,2021-11-26 13:41:30,1,24,Yup exactly. Some of these ‚Äúgurus‚Äù out there make it seem like your going to buy a lambo after your first prop if you follow exactly what they say but pay for their course first of course ü•¥
hm6tz4i,thatcbcb,2021-11-26 13:49:37,1,24,Nespresso machine and Apple TV would be a complete waste of money in my market but since you are a fellow guru I will offer up your course as an optional add-on to my course as long as you give me a commission on that add-on sale because everyone knows that gurus don‚Äôt actually care if they give you advice that‚Äôs useful to specific markets. Haha!  I‚Äôll send you an invite to be a guest on my podcast where we can vaguely discuss these things and then push people into our sales funnel to buy this information from us.
hm6vo85,orincoro,2021-11-26 14:02:57,1,24,Gurus gonna guru. This message brought to you by Nespresso.
hm72jqn,RobEreToll,2021-11-26 14:56:58,1,6,Its worth mentioning that you have a EV car charger available and what type of connector you have. In the future you can figure out fair ways to work it into your price or a metered charger. Current electrical utility prices arent too bad so in the short run leave it complimentary.
