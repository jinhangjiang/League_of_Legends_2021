rbx24w,rbx24w,rbx24w,Having problems changing language,whitemanondrugs,12/08/2021,1,On my old PC I used the “locale=en_US” to change the language on my league client but on the PC I am using now this does not work. When I go into my riot games folder and league of legends folder the leagueclient.exe program is an outdated client and will not update. Valorant was downloaded a while ago on this PC I’m not sure if that has anything to do with this.   If anyone has any advice on how I can change the language I would be very grateful. I cannot seem to find the updated league client anywhere. I believe it’s because my PC launches the game from the riot client.
rbwzjw,rbwzjw,rbwzjw,"With all this talk about ADC, it's super disappointing that no one is bringing up the XP issues",photographyraptr,12/08/2021,1,So theres been a lot of discussion about the subpar state adc feels like in preseason what with every champion one shotting adcs and the playstyle in general just feeling real rough with the pace of soloq.  Id like to call attention back to the change that made the role feel awful for me and has not felt good since and I think if Riot reverted this change for botlane there would be a MASSIVE shift in how it feels without changing anything else.  Im talking about the duo XP nerf from the previous preseason which was said to target funneling but in reality was far more impactful to bot lane. With all XP down ADCs have been 2-3 levels behind solo laners at really every stage of the game with surprising consistency and if one of your solo lanes starts dying that can turn into 3-4 level gap quite easily. This disparity in levels has made the role feel awful and I feel like if that change gets fixed in any way then the role would start to feel so much better. Games where I get stupid ahead in XP and Im actually more in line with levels of solo laners make the role feel actually balanced like I can still be one shot but I have more to play around and can answer well or my damage is actually threatening enough. With the pace of the game constantly increasing can we do one thing to help adcs come online faster and match the pace of the game everyone else is playing on?
rbwzjw,hnqvr7m,hnqvr7m,"With all this talk about ADC, it's super disappointing that no one is bringing up the XP issues",Lerric,12/08/2021,1,sadly adcs are now fodder for the rest of the lanes and they have lost quite a lot of their carry potential. Even if u farm a shitton u might still be below the solo laners level so its quite hard to come ahead in exp unless you get some kills early on (which is hard since you depend heavily on your team at that point). So as an adc your best bet is to not get killed and farm for 20 mins yeah very fun role. Hope riot takes an eye on this.
rbwzjw,hnqvt96,hnqvt96,"With all this talk about ADC, it's super disappointing that no one is bringing up the XP issues",NeloriIsTheCutest,12/08/2021,1,Im not sure what elo you play at but as the elo goes up so does the play style of supports change. Supports in higher elos (starting from gold) tend to lean much much less into being a botlanes pocketbuddy but try to be a roaming threat around drake and midlane too.
rbwqzu,rbwqzu,rbwqzu,Would you still take Flash if it cost both summoner spell slots?,rhench,12/08/2021,1,Ive accepted that Flash is never going away. It enables highlight reel plays and higher highs. Its ubiquitous with only a handful of champions even considering not taking it. But if it took up both slots of your summoner spells would you still take it? I think it would increase summoner spell diversity but Flash would still be widely used. What say you?
rbwqzu,hnqrrmt,hnqrrmt,Would you still take Flash if it cost both summoner spell slots?,vivlikesbuns,12/08/2021,1,No just take two combat sums and stat check your laner if that does happen
rbwqzu,hnqsenc,hnqsenc,Would you still take Flash if it cost both summoner spell slots?,Sublimity_Ult,12/08/2021,1,Yeah probably not. The meta would probably shift slightly to champs who don’t need flash. The value of tp + ignite is most likely higher than flash.
rbwqzu,hnqsfzp,hnqsfzp,Would you still take Flash if it cost both summoner spell slots?,zNYNz,12/08/2021,1,sure... if you double the range of flash to compensate
rbwqzu,hnqtlme,hnqtlme,Would you still take Flash if it cost both summoner spell slots?,ChaisawInsect,12/08/2021,1,I think they should remove it some time to see what happens with the meta.
rbwqzu,hnqve7i,hnqve7i,Would you still take Flash if it cost both summoner spell slots?,RiftHunter4,12/08/2021,1,It would likely be replaced with ghost in the meta.
rbwqzu,hnqv4qk,hnqv4qk,Would you still take Flash if it cost both summoner spell slots?,rhench,12/08/2021,1,I think you would likely reduce cd rather than mess with the range.
rbwqzu,hnquajb,hnquajb,Would you still take Flash if it cost both summoner spell slots?,Penelopisk,12/08/2021,1,Champs who has been balanced around their reliance on it for years would become dogshit i.e Annie

rbwksm,rbwksm,rbwksm,Kaisa's Ultimate CD is now almost the same as Xayah's,DeleteAllWeebs,12/08/2021,1,Kaisa rank 1 ult CD has been nerfed so hard its now 130 while Xayah rank 1 ult is 140.    Xayah ult is much more impactful than Kaisas  Vayne ult is 100 at rank 1 and this is an ability at least if not more impactful than Kaisa ult  Kaisa Ult nerf last season along with Q damage and early CD nerfs have made her feel terrible to play  She needs her damage back the rageblade changes last season mean she doesnt scale well anymore.  Shes not a new lethal abuser and now gets shit on by champs she used to be able to beat in lane.  Shes supposed to be a high skill champ yet she has a 47% WR in masters  &#x200B  The only reason people play her anymore is because shes fun to play.  Shes been bad for at least the second half of last season and not a buff in sight.  Kaisa needs help if giving her damage back isnt an option then she needs more range.  550 or 575 instead of 525 would go a long way in making her viable again.

rbwk08,rbwk08,rbwk08,Jinx gets an idea! (Short Animation),Demogorgon44,12/08/2021,1,[Animation](https://imgur.com/jMAeHlX)   I watched Arcane a few days ago(and absolutely loved it!) and wanted to have a go at a fanart of Jinx but also wanted to do something different so I went with this short animation. I didnt go with any fight sequence although it would have looked awesome but it would have taken a lot of time as well so I went with this simple sketch like animation.  I did this 2D frame by frame animation in toon boom. I hope you like it and please give me tips or suggestions so that I can improve my work. Thank you.
rbwhcw,rbwhcw,rbwhcw,"If ADCs lack agency its not because of the class, but the position where they are played",ItzBleKz,12/08/2021,0,You are an adc player and want agency? Go play adcs in top and midlane where a lot of them are actually viable and stop circlejerking there you got your solution you cant ask for a role that is sharing XP with another one to have the same agency as one that gets the full value LOL is a game about RESOURCES
rbwhcw,hnqqixf,hnqqixf,"If ADCs lack agency its not because of the class, but the position where they are played",Nebicus,12/08/2021,1,Most players play a lane not a class really so I think better advice would be to play apcs or something.
rbwhcw,hnqrcmb,hnqrcmb,"If ADCs lack agency its not because of the class, but the position where they are played",EmilianoR24,12/08/2021,1,I would say thats the opposite in bot adcs are really reluctant to play mages they would rather complain

rbwhcw,hnqui7o,hnqui7o,"If ADCs lack agency its not because of the class, but the position where they are played",stvrstrike,12/08/2021,1,I think the main reason ADCs lack agency is because of their comparatively weak early game which forces them into the duo lane.   If you want agency and to play an adc in a different lane just play Draven top lol
rbwhcw,hnqulrl,hnqulrl,"If ADCs lack agency its not because of the class, but the position where they are played",stvrstrike,12/08/2021,1,The best advice is dont play adc :(

rbwbzj,rbwbzj,rbwbzj,Do mages really belong in the support role?,GloinMyPimp,12/08/2021,1,In my opinion mages (xerath/brand/lux/zyra) being playable in support just makes things worse for everyone. I think it allows brainless players to climb without actually learning what a support is meant to do. What does a mage player really even have to think about in lane? If someone is playing an engage champ like Nautilus they have to consider things like who wins the engage ability timers summoner spells enemy jungler etc. but if you are playing brand all you really have to think about is casting your abilities on cooldown. Even someone playing an enchanter such as Lulu has to think about when to use their abilities in a way that benefits their adc the best.   Do you think it would be beneficial for the role if riot forced mages out of the support role? Maybe introducing some sort of flat damage reduction when buying support items?
rbwbzj,hnqqdqz,hnqqdqz,Do mages really belong in the support role?,crnkdeja,12/08/2021,1,As a velkoz player I find this post totally idiotic sorry. mages in support role have to position well to be useful in the game. Especially velkoz players. If you play Xerath even in mid and misposition a few inches it could mean death. Xerath and velkoz only have a stun and knockup respectfully. They arent tanky they arent quick they dont have a dash they cant turn invisible they dont have heal abilities.  That trade off between dmg vs survivability is fair if anything it favors the more tanky/healer champs that have little misplay consequences.  So you saying mages are brainless champs is wrong. Just because you are losing to them doesnt mean they are broken. You are just a worse player then them.
rbwbzj,hnqqf7a,hnqqf7a,Do mages really belong in the support role?,Novaeth,12/08/2021,1,Theres so much wrong here its hard to know where to start but the most insane thing to me is that you think an AP support wont oom in like two rotations at level three if theyre using abilities off cooldown assuming they arent *already* oom at level 2.
rbwbzj,hnqqptc,hnqqptc,Do mages really belong in the support role?,doglop,12/08/2021,1,First of all lux was made to be played as a midlaner and a support. Now there some mages that grant enough utility to be considered supports such as morgana(cc and anti cc)zyra(cc vision and zone control) seraphinekarmalux(cc shields). Then there are velkoz brandxerath and swain which are played as supports either for their range and poke or natural scaling(brand swain passive) This are the most controvercial ones but I personally dont care that they are played as supp cause although they are annoying they have many drawbacks like their lack of peel. Their arent necesarily easier to play especially in high elo where they are exploited by their weaknesses
rbwbzj,hnqq728,hnqq728,Do mages really belong in the support role?,KooshBaby,12/08/2021,1,i feel like support rn is mostly mage (ap) in my opinion i run neeko support and win most games. if they were to force mages out of support than what’s the point of even have mages ?? like i don’t understand what you’re trying to get at. Lux is one of the most OP mages and is terrific sup.
rbwbzj,hnqs11o,hnqs11o,Do mages really belong in the support role?,Mundane_Spend_7629,12/08/2021,1,As a mage you control the lane better than an enchanter or tank support and you are also more useful. If your ADC is bad then what stats are you boosting? You have to take the defeat because after a missplace the drama princess decide that you all should lose the game. As an enchanter or tank support  you cant do damage hold the lane or farm but only to walk with your jungler and try to gank 3v1. As an enchanter or tank you are too dependent of your ADC while as a mage you can still do something alone.
rbwbzj,hnqrarq,hnqrarq,Do mages really belong in the support role?,GloinMyPimp,12/08/2021,1,Everyone in the game has to position well. The difference with supports is that they dont need to do the things any other laners have to do. Mid lane mages have to worry about last hitting and controlling waves in order to reach their powerspikes while a mage support just has to cast abilities onto squishy targets in a lane that is much less punishable than mid.   Also im less so worried about losing to them than I am having to lane with them on my team
rbwbzj,hnqrhk7,hnqrhk7,Do mages really belong in the support role?,GloinMyPimp,12/08/2021,1,Who cares if they OOM? They can just back they dont rely on CS or XP so the only person being hurt if they back is their adc. Also msot mages dont need to manage mana past first back.
rbwbzj,hnqrzcr,hnqrzcr,Do mages really belong in the support role?,GloinMyPimp,12/08/2021,1,Its not about counterplay its about if they are healthy for the lane specifically if it feels good to be an adc and your support locks in lux. Its also about required skill to reach certain ranks.
rbwbzj,hnqqgnz,hnqqgnz,Do mages really belong in the support role?,GloinMyPimp,12/08/2021,1,? Mages can still be played in any other role
rbwbzj,hnqr7mg,hnqr7mg,Do mages really belong in the support role?,kooshcookie,12/08/2021,1,Exactly so what’s the problem with support? Most of the support items and builds are for Mages anyway. Stay top or mid lane if you don’t want to deal with them
rbwbzj,hnqr7k3,hnqr7k3,Do mages really belong in the support role?,KooshBaby,12/08/2021,1,but why should mages not go sup ? if it bothers you stay mid or top lul. league wouldnt put something in place for mages to not go sup

rbwbzj,hnqs9x0,hnqs9x0,Do mages really belong in the support role?,KooshBaby,12/08/2021,1,okay i can somewhat agree apologies read it wrong the first time. but don’t think ppl playing the first time is going to understand anything until they play. idk lol is so hard to understand
rbwbzj,hnqshs4,hnqshs4,Do mages really belong in the support role?,GloinMyPimp,12/08/2021,1,Cool. The idea here is that supports should be reliant on their ADCs just like their ADCs are reliant on them. You shouldnt be able to lock in mage and carry out the midlane fantasy without the skill required to play midlane.
rbwbzj,hnqsbt6,hnqsbt6,Do mages really belong in the support role?,Novaeth,12/08/2021,1,Mage supports provide poke and wave control. If they oom and base not only are they surrendering control of the lane god forbid their AD stays 1v2 and auto loses lane if you do that more than once.  AND most Mage supports actually do need XP to get to breakpoint levels usually 3 5 and 6 depending on the champ. If you lose XP tempo that really sucks because ADs like solo XP but its not going to make up for you being behind and surrendering tempo.  Also what do you mean most mages dont need to manage mana past first back? Youd need to base into mana component which most dont on first back  or be on a full manaflow to not have to care about mana unless youre an AP champ who just sets up one-shot all ins and then none of the other things you mention apply.
rbwbzj,hnqtql8,hnqtql8,Do mages really belong in the support role?,Mundane_Spend_7629,12/08/2021,1,You take mage to dominate the lane and all your ADC has to do us to adapt to your burst poke so when you engage he follow you do some damage and then go back to the farm.  So all 3 types of supports are ok but the mages ask for help from ADC too while the other 2 are slaves for the ADC. This is why ADC players dont like mages as support because their mentality cant accept the fact that the support needs help too.
rbwbzj,hnqswx1,hnqswx1,Do mages really belong in the support role?,GloinMyPimp,12/08/2021,1,What are we even arguing? That mages need to worry about mana sometimes so they are perfectly OK in the support role?
rbwbzj,hnqt3c0,hnqt3c0,Do mages really belong in the support role?,Novaeth,12/08/2021,1,That mage supports have clear defined weaknesses that if properly taken advantage of can be exploited into winning lane. Same as engage supports same as kill-lane supports same as enchanter supports.
rbwbzj,hnqtkwu,hnqtkwu,Do mages really belong in the support role?,GloinMyPimp,12/08/2021,1,When did I imply otherwise? This post is about the clear lack of skill required to play mage supports vs any other actual support champ due to the way they play the lane phase out. They arent playing support they are playing to carry.
rbwbzj,hnqucwq,hnqucwq,Do mages really belong in the support role?,Naymliss,12/08/2021,1,No clue why all Draven flairs on this sub are obsessed with skill and things of the like(well aside from their god constantly whining about it on stream probably).   >but if you are playing brand all you really have to think about is casting your abilities on cooldown  If you want to be useless and feed sure thats all you have to think about. That would be like saying all ADCs have to do is right click enemies with Red HP bars!  Theres a lot more nuance to them but you dont care to think about it critically because its just easier for you to complain I guess.
rbwbzj,hnquwgi,hnquwgi,Do mages really belong in the support role?,GloinMyPimp,12/08/2021,1,> No clue why all Draven flairs on this sub are obsessed with skill and things of the like(well aside from their god constantly whining about it on stream probably).  Skill requirement for roles in league is a good thing and you agree with that not sure why youre acting like you dont.  > Theres a lot more nuance to them but you dont care to think about it critically because its just easier for you to complain I guess.   Explain them to me then. Lets say you are a brand support and the enemy ADC walks into your W range what are you considering at that moment?

rbw4vg,rbw4vg,rbw4vg,How to fix ADC,Progenitor3,12/08/2021,1,We all know ADC is a dead role. No one plays it anymore or even wants to play it except the most skilled players which are hard to find.  Which got me thinking why do ADCs get the same experience as the supports when the ADCs are the ones last hitting minions? Doesnt it make more sense for ADCs to get full exp in bot lane and be the same level as the solo laners? I mean if Im sitting bot and farming while my mid laner is sitting mid and farming why do they get more experience than I do? Why do Junglers get more exp than ADCs when they play PvE while the ADCs play the hardest role?   Also since ADC was originally supposed to be a late game scaling role but the games are so short now that ADCs are irrelevant why not give ADCs more gold early compared to other roles to compensate for this?  I dont play ADC anymore but back when I played it (s5 and s6) I always wondered why I and the other ADC always had the least impact on the outcome of the game despite being the most skilled players almost all the time.  What do you hid guys think?
rbw4vg,hnqnfba,hnqnfba,How to fix ADC,Hazardarina,12/08/2021,1,Then champs that spike hardest with items would go bot if youre talking about bot creeps giving more gold.

rbw4vg,hnqr3v2,hnqr3v2,How to fix ADC,Nebicus,12/08/2021,1,It would wreck some of the fantasy imo but you could easily fix the perceived problems with role by simply moving adc power budget into tankier stats and decreasing damage. Do I think this is a good idea. Idk im not sure but the presence of shieldbow shows that this helps adcs feel better about their situation.

Fafnir and Tanuki guys whole kits rely on gold especially fafnir that the more he has gold the tankier he is. What would you think of a champ like that  ?

rbvo4f,rbvo4f,rbvo4f,It's almost season 12 and Maw of Malmortius is still a garbage item.,1nc000,12/08/2021,3,Maw of Malmortius used to be the niche mr item for ADCs AD assassins and AD champions in general and was used as counterplay to AP burst.  &#x200B  With the Season 11 preseason changes the item just became garbage (it wasnt that much better before anyway) and as a result it is completely underplayed becoming the 5th most underplayed item according to league of items. ( [https://leagueofitems.com/tierlist](https://leagueofitems.com/tierlist) )  &#x200B  It doesnt really need much thinking :  &#x200B  The main issue with the item is that the shield scales off of HP and the item gives none.  Either replace the AH with HP and call it a day or just change the shields scaling and make it much more stronger.  &#x200B  Currently theres absolutely no reason to build Maw over Steraks on bruisers unless youre going vs a full AP comp since steraks shield is much larger and blocks both physical and magic damage not to mention Steraks Bloodlust passive.  And on ADCs its not worth it yet again since you have other options and theres better items to build.  &#x200B  I think its time to change Maw and all other MR items since (burst) mages are slowly taking over the meta.

rbvjm6,rbvjm6,rbvjm6,Nunu vs Shaco Matchup Help,MrInsanely,12/08/2021,1,First I wanna say I’m pretty new to the game compared to others (lvl 69 and even newer to ranked). I am jungle main when I comes to ranked (silver 3) who mainly plays nunu and Viego. I literally only ban yi so banning shaco isn’t an option unfortunately.   Apparently Nunu is a strong counter matchup to shaco. But the games I lose are to shacos picking into me. I constantly just get demolished by him early and his invades screw me over very hard and I’m out of the game at that point. My laners rarely come to help me when he is invading even tho I ping that he’s stealing it (I can imagine this is bc I’m in silver but I have no clue). He always counter ganks me too rendering me useless in majority of my ganks. I honestly don’t know what to do when I see him picked into me. I’ve watched guides but they don’t help to much at all.   I just need to know what to do in a shaco matchup and what to build to help me fight him and win ganks better.
rbvjm6,hnqrnvr,hnqrnvr,Nunu vs Shaco Matchup Help,ApplePitou,12/08/2021,1,The biggest counter vs Shaco is tankiness so it is enough to build 1-2 items for the tank and then Shaco has a huge problem with killing a Champion like Nunu additionally if Shaco steals your Jungle then I recommend you to gank lanes because Nunu with his W does it very simply :3
rbvgwj,rbvgwj,rbvgwj,Is it possible to add champion rerolls to custom games?,Panzerfahrer01,12/08/2021,2,Whats better than enjoying a round of ARAM with your friends? However a problem arises if you play ARAM in custom games. Due to the nature of custom games you can not reroll your champions. Therefore some people are stuck with champions they would rather reroll.   &#x200B  Hence my question: Could you implement rerolls to custom games (ARAM)?

We have all players random twice. Everyone writes these champs down in the team chat and those are your champs anyone on that team can choose from. If there are any duplicates just reroll until you have (number of players on a team * 2) number of champs on the bench. We also have implemented a rule where if you dont like any of the champs on your bench you can random one more time and you must play that champ. These rules have worked out very successfully for our group.

rbvg3c,rbvg3c,rbvg3c,Sharing advice for players below Diamond.,StoryTeller000,12/08/2021,2,Let me start by saying that I have no business offering advice to anyone. I speak strictly from my experience and how I win games. Perfect.  Here it is: Dragons win games.  Below Diamond players struggle with dragon management. This is not for junglers specifically dragons are laners responsibility also. What does this mean and how can you abuse this?  When to take dragons or when to fight at dragon pit will a majority of the time decide games. Understanding the map and when your teammates can rotate is a skill that will require time and experience to master. I cannot explain the skill because I do not know it but guess what? The majority of sub Diamond players dont. If nobody in low elo games knows dragon management how can make sure we can get dragons and win games?  You can win games through dragons by abusing your opponents lack of dragon management. When dragons spawn its very likely that they will start thinking about how and when to get dragon. They will let time pass before taking dragon as they attempt to think about when to do it. The problem is these players do not know what they are doing. By thinking about something they do not understand they waste a lot of time. How do you punish them for overthinking?  You punish your opponent by doing all dragons on spawn. I know sounds crazy! While your opponent is overthinking when to dragon you take it immediately. In my experience through sub Diamond players are never ready to contest my teams that do dragons on spawn. By the time they pull their head our of their ass you are already ahead. This method is not perfect because bot mid and jungle will need to be on the same page and thats not easy sub Diamond. You can address this concern by pinging dragon every 3 minutes or so.  Its very difficult to just take my word for it but to share an actual example I played 7 games in a row recently (all wins) and by doing all dragons on spawn my teams went 28-0 in dragons. Players sub Diamond just do not understand dragon management and doing dragons on spawn will throw them off their game and give you an early advantage.  Sorry if this was poorly written I am the dumb. Give this an actual try before you flame the strat. Thanks for taking time to read it.
rbvg3c,hnqjfeg,hnqjfeg,Sharing advice for players below Diamond.,UnfunnyGermanDude,12/08/2021,1,Usually as I do this the enemy team is well prepared after the 2nd maximum. There’s a bit more to that like wards and general map control you should consider but the general advise is correct. Sometimes it’s worth waiting for 1-2 picks to get drake especially after the enemy understands what you are trying to achieve
rbvg3c,hnqkyk5,hnqkyk5,Sharing advice for players below Diamond.,SuperSucc69,12/08/2021,1,Hard agree. We did this pretty much every Clash since drakes got important. Ignore our toplaner since he just played tanks hard focus mid and bot and get every drake asap. Worked very well most of the time. Doing that in soloq is a bit harder when you dont play jungle tho xD
rbvg3c,hnqkiir,hnqkiir,Sharing advice for players below Diamond.,StoryTeller000,12/08/2021,1,I would agree that the opponent has usually adapted to my play style after 2 drags but honestly if we already have 2 drags we are already ahead. It is too late (unless someone starts trolling).
rbvg3c,hnqlnry,hnqlnry,Sharing advice for players below Diamond.,StoryTeller000,12/08/2021,1,Glad to hear its working for you. When I run bot lane in soloQ I will ping dragon often and as soon as its up Ill run right to it. Drag matters more then that Canon minion.
rbvg3c,hnqownz,hnqownz,Sharing advice for players below Diamond.,ConscienceNot,12/08/2021,1,I have never been diamond or even plat but to be honest there is correlation between drakes and won game but drakes are NOT the causation. At least at my games where its the winning team that takes drakes and well they are already WINNING and would win anyway.
rbvg3c,hnqp5ny,hnqp5ny,Sharing advice for players below Diamond.,StoryTeller000,12/08/2021,1,This sounds like your teams are falling behind before the first dragon. If youre losing pre 5 minutes that might be a different issue all together

Now he wants to play league with me he never played it. But for some reason League is the only game where you cant select the language you want. It’s impossible for him to select Japanese Voice and Font its sooo hard for him to play the game. Is there any know reason why Riot did that? Do you know any trick how to select other languages?
rbv7of,hnqhv29,hnqhv29,Is there a reason why you can’t chose the language you want?,Arandui,12/08/2021,1,You only can chose the languages of the region where you are playing. Which means in Euw you can only chose English German French Spain and some others. For Japanese you would need to play in the Japan region. Afaik there is no way to change that. Maybe there might be a fan mod or domething but nothing official.

Even with Caps that statement is still 100% true. Caps and Perkz have the same international achievements barring one Caps world final versus one Perkz semifinal with both losing to the same team.  When you come to domestic performance Perkz has 3 extra domestic titles.  Sounds like one of those two has way more accolades than the other.

Both regions got a team to quarters - but MAD lost to the better opposition.   In the year where EU had 1 team hard implode due to the Upset fiasco and another where players were sick on stage....  AND lets be real all the NA teams at worlds are hardcarried by europeans....  Even then you still did worse (generously the same).

Ive constantly brought it up this year when people were questioning his performance on C9. It was clear he was taking a more relaxed approach in NA (which hurts performance obviously). Hes also talked about extreme burnout at the end of 2018 2019 and 2020 so it makes sense. And he was on the Crack Down just after joining C9 I believe where he said he considered becoming a streamer before deciding to go to NA.  Im really excited to see what kind of Perkz we will get in 2022.

rbur21,hnqtc9z,hnqtc9z,Team Vitality’s New ‘League Of Legends’ Star Perkz Considered Retiring Last Year,ArjunBanerji27,12/08/2021,1,I hope you realize that Perkz began in EU LCS(2016) literally 1 season before Caps(2017).  And let us just compare them in terms of the single year they werent on the same team then. The most recent year.  I see one player with a domestic title and a worlds quarters appearance. The other with neither. You tell me which is which and which one had more successful year.
rbur21,hnqstqu,hnqstqu,Team Vitality’s New ‘League Of Legends’ Star Perkz Considered Retiring Last Year,Rumbleinthejungle8,12/08/2021,1,You think a player like Perkz who has won MSI and has made semis 3 times finals once gives a shit about winning spring split in the LCS? You think thats his goal? He goes from trying to win Worlds to trying to win fucking LCS.    The situation with Perkz is different because he was essentially **forced** to go to NA by Ocealote. But still he didnt choose to go to NA because he wanted to win. Why the hell would he? And again Perkz is an exception. There are tons of players who have even made it clear on twitter or streams that they are going to NA for the LA weather and the easy paycheck. And yet teams still decide to pick them up. Bang is probably the best example. Yeah a 2 time Worlds champion goes to your shitty NA team because he wants to win right... he even implied multiple times that he was in NA for the weather. So if it was clear winning wasnt his priority why did 100Thieves pick him up?

As long as either 2020 or 2019 is included Perkz beats out everyone but Caps(or the rest of G2 I guess)  Now comparing Caps and Perkz in recent years would really mean comparing them in 2021. And 2021 went heavily in favor of one of those 2 players.

And you have to count the year that Perkz was playing and Caps wasnt to give Perkz a lead.  The article exclusively mentions EU accolades and refers to in recent years.    You can be a Perkz fanboy and act like theres no debate if you want but youre wrong. The western GOAT conversation is a debate between Perkz and Caps. Its an undoubtedly closer debate if you specify in recent years. Acting like that convo isnt even close is misinformation. Thats really all there is to it.
rbur21,hnqut2d,hnqut2d,Team Vitality’s New ‘League Of Legends’ Star Perkz Considered Retiring Last Year,GoJeonPaa,12/08/2021,1,Then i have to disagree. If i pick the period from 2018 on which could mean recent years to today Caps was more successful than Perkz. Especially if you count in MVPs.

Regardless the only year which makes this a question at all is 2018. Every other year was with Perkz heavily ahead or them on the same team.
rbur21,hnqvigd,hnqvigd,Team Vitality’s New ‘League Of Legends’ Star Perkz Considered Retiring Last Year,ArjunBanerji27,12/08/2021,1,Your original comment was also certainly a take. A factually wrong one but a take nonetheless.  In recent years would mean literally only the previous year because they played on the same team for two years prior.  You give your arbitrary definition of recent years. Let me guess it starts from 2018. Because that is the only period of time you can pick since these two players started their careers where you can show their accomplishments are similar.

rbur21,hnqu893,hnqu893,Team Vitality’s New ‘League Of Legends’ Star Perkz Considered Retiring Last Year,MastemasD,12/08/2021,1,You needed one EU team to implode and then another to play with 4 players in order to achieve exact same results. Not to mention that RGE vs C9 tie breaker was literally live and die by Perkz. If he didnt turbo carry last few minutes youd yet again have 0 teams in quarters. But I get it - finally one team out of groups in 3 years and youre back to being deluded about your region.  And then you cretins cry about being bullied by EU fans for the entire year lmao. Stop deluding yourself and then noone will shit on you. Nobodys shitting on PCS or minor region fans because they dont pretend to be better than they are. Learn from them.

Yeah you could pretend that the 2 years prior didnt happen.  Or you know you could not do that. Because those years did happen. And that makes their accolades during that time very close.   >You give your arbitrary definition of recent years. Let me guess it starts from 2018. Because that is the only period of time you can pick since these two players started their careers where you can show their accomplishments are similar.  Whereas youre literally pretending years where they played together dont exist. Which is not how accolades work.
rbuqbs,rbuqbs,rbuqbs,Why Camille not been herf by her Q,Afraid-Reputation-40,12/08/2021,0,In the recent patch riot will be nerfing her w sweet spot and her e. Why are they not nerfing her Q conversion percent or her synergy with divine (more generally spell blade items). I am confused by how are they doing to Camille. I need some explanation because I am hardstuck iron.
rbuqbs,hnqdhwp,hnqdhwp,Why Camille not been herf by her Q,CreativeAd481,12/08/2021,1,Its likely because you cant really outplay her Q but you can outplay her W and her E.   Its worth noting that Camille heals 100% of the damage she does with her W sweetspot so any nerf to its damage essentially double dips by nerfing her healing as well. A 60 damage nerf becomes a 120 health swing in the duel since she misses out on the equivalent healing.  On day 1 of the patch Camille is down to a 49% winrate from a 52.5% winrate last patch. A 3.5% winrate drop is extremely large and I think based on early data she does not need any more nerfs.
rbuqbs,hnqen07,hnqen07,Why Camille not been herf by her Q,xXbehramXx,12/08/2021,1,probably u re new in the gamethis is just riot things.E cooldown nerf actually means nothing for camille in lane .Just increase her Q damage and Reduce the True damage raito
rbuqbs,hnqg56l,hnqg56l,Why Camille not been herf by her Q,HalexUwU,12/08/2021,1,Camilles Q has basically never been changed the abilities damage now is pretty much the same as it was on release.  Its better to change other things since her Q is only an issue when the rest of her kit is already strong
rbuqbs,hnqhrje,hnqhrje,Why Camille not been herf by her Q,TatteredVexation,12/08/2021,1,Sounds like you dont really know what makes Camille strong in lane. That nerf is pretty huge to her laning phase.

rbuqbs,hnqmfes,hnqmfes,Why Camille not been herf by her Q,BobIsMyCableGuy,12/08/2021,1,You cant really outplay the Q
rbuqbs,hnqoi74,hnqoi74,Why Camille not been herf by her Q,IamLevels,12/08/2021,1,Statistically I agree with you but emotionally she needs more nerfs. 3.5% drop after having sat above 52% winrate for over a season feels like a slap to the face of every toplaner that had to tolerate laning against her.   Plenty of champs have got worse nerfs for sitting at that winrate for a patch or two while she dodged all nerfs for over a year. Fair punishment would be to gut her so people stop playing her and then bring some buffs in 2-3 patches to get her back around 50%. It’s what she deserves for being Riot’s favorite top laner for well over a season.
rbuqbs,hnqou8q,hnqou8q,Why Camille not been herf by her Q,CreativeAd481,12/08/2021,1,She wasnt above 52% winrate for the entire season.
rbuqbs,hnqqsbj,hnqqsbj,Why Camille not been herf by her Q,IamLevels,12/08/2021,1,https://lolalytics.com/lol/camille/build/  Go look at her winrate patch by patch. She has averaged a 52.1% winrate across the last 16 patches in plat+. And the higher you set the elo the higher her winrate went.

rbuhil,hnqcxbz,hnqcxbz,2022 Vitality roster,DickerDave,12/08/2021,1,>The biggest LEC roster ever seen  Wut? I mean of course its really good and has loads of potential but its definitly not the best LEC roster ever.
rbuhil,hnqcbvl,hnqcbvl,2022 Vitality roster,k3hvn,12/08/2021,1,Considering how hyped this roster is very very underwhelming announcement
rbuhil,hnqbx3y,hnqbx3y,2022 Vitality roster,apolix08,12/08/2021,1,Big if true
rbuhil,hnqbvam,hnqbvam,2022 Vitality roster,ArjunBanerji27,12/08/2021,1,Damn. After delaying the announcement for a while they really could have made a more hype announcement video.
rbuhil,hnqci7y,hnqci7y,2022 Vitality roster,statiky,12/08/2021,1,If the personalities and egos mesh this roster is top 2 for sure. If not mental boom incoming.    Also super curious to see how Labrov plays with this roster. Never thought much of him so I hope he and Carzzy can keep up.
rbuhil,hnqc2kk,hnqc2kk,2022 Vitality roster,Dumpers_,12/08/2021,1,Disappointing announcement video and also disappointed in the fact they announced everyone together... that being said really excited to see how this roster will function and if Perkz can get back to form now that he is back in EU.  Although I think this roster might be a little over hyped if Vitality made playoffs with that roster last year then they should be able to contend for the title this year if they can figure out how they want to play... (leave Carzzy on an island)
rbuhil,hnqcxbs,hnqcxbs,2022 Vitality roster,ImVortexlol,12/08/2021,1,Such a let-down of an announcement video seeing that the roster has been confirmed for a while

rbuhil,hnqcn19,hnqcn19,2022 Vitality roster,Mythik16,12/08/2021,1,I dont think this roster will mental boom or anything like that I just have a bad feeling idk why I just feel like FNC will be so clear of this team.
rbuhil,hnqfb2r,hnqfb2r,2022 Vitality roster,Hoodini__21,12/08/2021,1,Vitality spring champions.
rbuhil,hnqc8bt,hnqc8bt,2022 Vitality roster,LasergunPiuPiu,12/08/2021,1,Tbh the hype really decreased through all the spoilers but seeing them in the trailer made me realize how fucking stacked this team is and I dont really know where this mental boom garbage is coming from.   Its a top 2 roster at least in spring.
rbuhil,hnqbyal,hnqbyal,2022 Vitality roster,Feelsgoodman1234,12/08/2021,1,Looks fine to be top2 at least in lec but Im not sold on perkz and botlane that high internationally. Will make it out of groups but making it to top 4 will be difficult.

rbuhil,hnqgxtq,hnqgxtq,2022 Vitality roster,lewandor,12/08/2021,1,Not sure which one is the biggest marketing lie :  - tHe biGgEsT LeC rOsTEr eVer SeEn   - wE gAthERed tHe BeSt EU pLaYeRs  Also please stop calling it a super team. Based on what they showed last season not a single player on this roster is considered the best at his position in LEC atm. You can make a case for Alphari maybe. High buyouts and a legacy doesnt change that fact. Its a super upgrade for VIT thats it. They are not expected to win the LEC they are amongs the favorites. Same for performing internationally.
rbuhil,hnqcagl,hnqcagl,2022 Vitality roster,Narrow-Quit,12/08/2021,1,Hot take: This team wins spring and wins MSI but implodes in summer and doesnt make worlds
rbuhil,hnqewo5,hnqewo5,2022 Vitality roster,Zefaqq,12/08/2021,1,either win or mental boom we get it its been 6 months that were hearing this bullshit phrase. I swear Reddit loves to create these brainless takes

rbuhil,hnqgmf0,hnqgmf0,2022 Vitality roster,Zuldak,12/08/2021,1,There is talent on this team but will we see the 2019 talent or the 2021 fall off?  I hope to see EU Perkz not NA Perkz

rbuhil,hnqhfpz,hnqhfpz,2022 Vitality roster,Longers2,12/08/2021,1,Im curious to see if this will be the biggest superteam flop since Elements in season 5.
rbuhil,hnqhk62,hnqhk62,2022 Vitality roster,w23333,12/08/2021,1,Think this roster will thrive on Perkz if he plays like he did in NA then this roster is doomed and LEC as a whole is doomed except for FNC.
rbuhil,hnqis27,hnqis27,2022 Vitality roster,youjustabattlerapper,12/08/2021,1,How are Selfmade Carzzy or Labrov (or even Perkz for that matter) the best EU players?
rbuhil,hnqbxqt,hnqbxqt,2022 Vitality roster,bigfanofeden,12/08/2021,1,i feel like they gonna be like 5th place and mental boomed. idk tho perkz is the goat maybe he can be able to sucess something otherwise i aint trust anyone but him.
rbuhil,hnqen87,hnqen87,2022 Vitality roster,xXxWeed_Wizard420xXx,12/08/2021,1,>This super team is expected to win the LEC and even perform internationally. What do you think?  Lmao. Its a good roster but it really isnt as good as you make it out to be. Selfmade has had struggles. Perkz has had big struggles even in NA.  Im not saying the players arent good. Just saying there are definitely several ways this roster could turn out underwhelming.  I expect top 4 from them though.
rbuhil,hnqd8sx,hnqd8sx,2022 Vitality roster,Stephhennash,12/08/2021,1,Most handsome team ever?

rbuhil,hnqhf5e,hnqhf5e,2022 Vitality roster,VoidChaoticGod,12/08/2021,1,anything below winning the split for this rooster would be considered a failure.
rbuhil,hnqi0a5,hnqi0a5,2022 Vitality roster,38erJustus,12/08/2021,1,if the rookies this year turn out to be talents EU might not be as ruined by NA money as i thought. if mad/g2 rookies turn out to be stinkers tho we might be back to actually only having 2 solid teams again lol
rbuhil,hnqi8x1,hnqi8x1,2022 Vitality roster,Syncron72,12/08/2021,1,I can’t wait to see perkz back in LEC as a mid

rbuhil,hnqk2st,hnqk2st,2022 Vitality roster,BeautifulNacho,12/08/2021,1,Didn’t make them go abseiling from the Eiffeltower. 1/5
rbuhil,hnqk2wx,hnqk2wx,2022 Vitality roster,PurplePotato_,12/08/2021,1,Unpopular opinion: this roster wont be as good as everyone hopes it will be. Not because of synergy but because of individual skill of the players.
rbuhil,hnqk6dp,hnqk6dp,2022 Vitality roster,Sellier123,12/08/2021,1,I mean id be legit shocked if they swept europe. Should be a contender for the top but no where near a gurantee.
rbuhil,hnqf91o,hnqf91o,2022 Vitality roster,sherm137,12/08/2021,1,If anyone saw Perkz play last year I would temper expectations some. He was playing against very shitty NA mids and wasnt even top 3.   Not saying he wont or cant be good this year but he was not good last year.
rbuhil,hnqge6f,hnqge6f,2022 Vitality roster,LuckyCulture7,12/08/2021,1,I feel like selfmade is the Dardoch of LEC. He is a super talented player but seems to cause issues. Maybe I am wrong but that is my impression.
rbuhil,hnqbyg1,hnqbyg1,2022 Vitality roster,Transhumaniste,12/08/2021,1,Dont forget the EDM in the background
rbuhil,hnqeynw,hnqeynw,2022 Vitality roster,00Dandy,12/08/2021,1,Neo said on Twitter that there will be more content in January
rbuhil,hnqfu65,hnqfu65,2022 Vitality roster,Enjays1,12/08/2021,1,Maybe a Plan B as covid restrictions in germany got harsher again
rbuhil,hnqg04t,hnqg04t,2022 Vitality roster,Ho-Nomo,12/08/2021,1,If Vitality want to be among the top supported teams in EU theyre going to have to massively step up the PR and social media game.
rbuhil,hnqgtdw,hnqgtdw,2022 Vitality roster,WangBaeHo,12/08/2021,1,I like this one more. Goes hard tbh.
rbuhil,hnqjx6j,hnqjx6j,2022 Vitality roster,PsYcHoSeAn,12/08/2021,1,Everyone knew the roster anyway. Why invest tons of money into a video confirming it?  I just dont understand why the superteam narrative gets pushed over and over again. Has nobody learned from the past? You can go back to Alliance / Elements and see how they crashed...and most recently obviously G2.  Teams jinx themselves.
rbuhil,hnqdrsk,hnqdrsk,2022 Vitality roster,Karlsefni1,12/08/2021,1,Yeah the announcement of 2019 G2 with Caps and Mikyx joining was much bigger Rekkles leaving FNC for G2 also felt bigger. That being said this is still a super exciting roster.
rbuhil,hnqehja,hnqehja,2022 Vitality roster,Hecate27,12/08/2021,1,Pretty sure this is a player for player worse lineup than 2019 G2.
rbuhil,hnqdtdx,hnqdtdx,2022 Vitality roster,RudiGarcia,12/08/2021,1,Not even the best LEC roster this year on paper lmao
rbuhil,hnqfbty,hnqfbty,2022 Vitality roster,GGnextMatt,12/08/2021,1,This kids dont remember alliance
rbuhil,hnqf986,hnqf986,2022 Vitality roster,Transhumaniste,12/08/2021,1,Thats marketing they are hyping their very good roster changes. Its understandable Imo.
rbuhil,hnqesr1,hnqesr1,2022 Vitality roster,CinderrUwU,12/08/2021,1,I really doubt that any team could match the 2019 G2 hype. They had by far the best players in the entire region at the time (especially by worlds where Perkz/MickyX were clear favourites over Rekkles/Hyili)   As it stands I dont even see VIT winning LEC especially with FNCs roster and wouldnt be surprised if the rebuilt G2/RGE/MAD took them out. The only real standout player in this roster is Carzzy if anything now with how strong eu topsides are.
rbuhil,hnqdaj3,hnqdaj3,2022 Vitality roster,YouShouldAim,12/08/2021,1,No budget left over for marketing lol
rbuhil,hnqcvlq,hnqcvlq,2022 Vitality roster,Transhumaniste,12/08/2021,1,Large if factual
rbuhil,hnqcujb,hnqcujb,2022 Vitality roster,Transhumaniste,12/08/2021,1,They had to edit the video
rbuhil,hnqemjt,hnqemjt,2022 Vitality roster,bensanelian,12/08/2021,1,i think labrov is a top 3 support in eu lets hope i can prove you wrong !!
rbuhil,hnqfp5s,hnqfp5s,2022 Vitality roster,Transhumaniste,12/08/2021,1,They already joked about exploding I think they will get along.
rbuhil,hnqh0dy,hnqh0dy,2022 Vitality roster,bin_fanboy9,12/08/2021,1,Based on this years performance Labrov is the second best player on this roster
rbuhil,hnqifgf,hnqifgf,2022 Vitality roster,Rumbleinthejungle8,12/08/2021,1,There are a lot of big personalities on the roster. I think it is seriously a concern and this roster will be either dominating by summer split or it will implode.
rbuhil,hnqet6p,hnqet6p,2022 Vitality roster,ZXKeyr324XZ,12/08/2021,1,Better botlane arguably better midlane equivalent jungle and 50/50 better/worse toplane depends on whether Wunder is back to form or not
rbuhil,hnqcy1x,hnqcy1x,2022 Vitality roster,inde99,12/08/2021,1,The mental boom garbage comes from TL fans hard pushing this Alphari diva narrative while looking for a scapegoat for another 3-3 run in groups. Meanwhile nobody in EU ever complained about him and his attitude even during the infamous 10th place OG run in Summer 2020 when he for sure had a lot of reasons to be frustrated.
rbuhil,hnqi8ab,hnqi8ab,2022 Vitality roster,LtSpaceDucK,12/08/2021,1,A team with Alphari Perkz and Selfmade all players with very strong opinions on how the game should be played I can see them have a bad Spring Split might take a while for them to agree on how the team should play.
rbuhil,hnqk2qb,hnqk2qb,2022 Vitality roster,1einspieler,12/08/2021,1,If you had this roster in 2021 the hype would‘ve been unreal and people still rate Alphari Selfmade and Perkz like before the 2021 season despite all 3 of them just having the worst splits of their careers
rbuhil,hnqk4or,hnqk4or,2022 Vitality roster,Sugar230,12/08/2021,1,Its a super team bro I know u may not like it but this is what peak west performance looks like.
rbuhil,hnqciht,hnqciht,2022 Vitality roster,mmmb2y,12/08/2021,1,sounds like your average superteam
rbuhil,hnqedfx,hnqedfx,2022 Vitality roster,puberty1,12/08/2021,1,Kingzone moment (except they got 2nd at MSI)
rbuhil,hnqh91c,hnqh91c,2022 Vitality roster,Lucytos,12/08/2021,1,knowing how volatile league is and performances are making any predictions is pointless. Also team dynamic and hitting the right tone is more important than individual skill like how Doinb hard carried his team to win worlds even though he didnt dominate lane.  Even the worst players on paper can suddenly be top tier if the stars align in them all finding their right tone and being ahead in the meta.
rbuhil,hnqgpff,hnqgpff,2022 Vitality roster,LuckyCulture7,12/08/2021,1,This team won’t be able to beat Korean teams because they will get torn apart in mid-late game. I suspect a lot of early leads thrown away by poor mid game play like pushing too far or just failing to transfer leads. That was both Alphari and Perkz biggest issues while in NA.
rbuhil,hnqgteq,hnqgteq,2022 Vitality roster,Season2WasBetter,12/08/2021,1,nothing in between
rbuhil,hnqcqhm,hnqcqhm,2022 Vitality roster,Mythik16,12/08/2021,1,I feel like Perkz is the biggest question mark on this team ngl. Granted it was NA so hell probably be properly back now. Will be interesting to see Carzzy without Kaiser whos probably the joint best support in EU.
rbuhil,hnqcgcr,hnqcgcr,2022 Vitality roster,ArjunBanerji27,12/08/2021,1,This roster is either going to be run like a tight ship by Perkz and that is how I expect it to go since as far as I can tell he basically built it and picked everyone aside from Labrov himself.  Or Selfmade will mental boom all of his teammates and this team will be committed to mediocrity.  Either way should be a fun ride.
rbuhil,hnqfe8p,hnqfe8p,2022 Vitality roster,sherm137,12/08/2021,1,I feel like Perkz is the weak link on the roster based on what we saw of him last season.
rbuhil,hnqh161,hnqh161,2022 Vitality roster,Longers2,12/08/2021,1,Agree. TL fan here and Alphari is a beast in lane but never seems to translate his leads to the rest of the map. Also seems like a huge diva. The way he handles himself on social media really is not conducive to a healthy team culture.
rbuhil,hnqgoso,hnqgoso,2022 Vitality roster,Deep_Panda_5148,12/08/2021,1,Hands top notch the rest is eh.
rbuhil,hnqhnl7,hnqhnl7,2022 Vitality roster,ancientgreenpeach,12/08/2021,1,But now he has the western goat on his team that happens to be a great leader as well. He will know his place in this lineup.
rbuhil,hnqdk7s,hnqdk7s,2022 Vitality roster,Conankun66,12/08/2021,1,the music is legit horrible
rbuhil,hnqfhbt,hnqfhbt,2022 Vitality roster,NamikazeEU,12/08/2021,1,The announcement of G2 was mostly about Caps though. Mikyx was by no means a superstar name. He was even benched or his spot taken if I remember correctly before he joined G2. Plus the perkz ADC was a huge question mark aswell. Sure  G2 was super team but I dont think on same level as this one (on paper before the season started not actual accompishments).
rbuhil,hnqgm8h,hnqgm8h,2022 Vitality roster,Boockel,12/08/2021,1,Alphari is the best top in the west so no. Selfmade I think is on par with jankos so again no Perkz and caps are similar skill but its probably slightly caps favored. Carzzy is better than perkz adc imo although it could go to either Yeah miky is better than labrov
rbuhil,hnqf56k,hnqf56k,2022 Vitality roster,SchindlersVirus,12/08/2021,1,What would be the best one on paper?
rbuhil,hnqfs46,hnqfs46,2022 Vitality roster,NamikazeEU,12/08/2021,1,Its top2 though alongside Fnatic if Humanoid/Wunder joins FNC.    This is incredible line-up.
rbuhil,hnqf855,hnqf855,2022 Vitality roster,Riven_Genji_Wraith,12/08/2021,1,Then what is
rbuhil,hnqg360,hnqg360,2022 Vitality roster,DickerDave,12/08/2021,1,I completely understand why they do it from a marketing perspective but it doesnt change that it is ridiculous. Obviously only time will tell how good they will turn out but on paper I wouldnt even put them in the Top 5(maybe even Top 10) of all time in EU.
rbuhil,hnqhntv,hnqhntv,2022 Vitality roster,LtSpaceDucK,12/08/2021,1,I understand that but if the team underperforms or doesnt have a good start in Spring this type of hype wont do them any favours  I can see this team struggle in Spring
rbuhil,hnqjrse,hnqjrse,2022 Vitality roster,AconexOfficial,12/08/2021,1,interesting that you see Perkz/Mikyx as clear favourites against Rekkles/Hyli in 2019.  I remember it more that way: Rekkles/Hyli was the stronger pound for pound lane but Perkz/Mikyx had much more flexibility in playstyle and pickwise which gave the team overall more opportunities. They lost lane often vs Rekkles/Hyli though especially in the summer bo5s
rbuhil,hnqfcza,hnqfcza,2022 Vitality roster,Transhumaniste,12/08/2021,1,They spent it on Perkzs buy out
rbuhil,hnqj7bu,hnqj7bu,2022 Vitality roster,azns123,12/08/2021,1,Reminds me of the OG classic https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6f2la5/og_reveal_their_new_roster/

rbuhil,hnqezlf,hnqezlf,2022 Vitality roster,Mythik16,12/08/2021,1,>arguably better midlane equivalent jungle  I dont think mid is arguable based off his split in NA Humanoid is certainly better but can never count Perkz out and Razork is definitely better than Selfmade IMO.
rbuhil,hnqeeaa,hnqeeaa,2022 Vitality roster,random_nickname43796,12/08/2021,1,Idk man Alphari may had good laning stats also got a lot of focus from JG and even support but he didnt use his leads properly which lost TL some games. Like the last game with ego picking Jayce when tank would be a better option only to fail miserably
rbuhil,hnqfhrz,hnqfhrz,2022 Vitality roster,NenBE4ST,12/08/2021,1,Its pretty hilarious considering his past on OG and ALSO how bad and unlucky the situation became on TL yet they still ended up pulling it together and being super close to making quarters lol.  Like if anything people can say he may be a diva but will get his shit together and perform
rbuhil,hnqd8au,hnqd8au,2022 Vitality roster,LasergunPiuPiu,12/08/2021,1,I think its a cultural difference and not solely scapegoating. Communication in Europe just seams a lot more honest and direct.   I think there was a clip of S04 last season where their adc straight up asked how they can lose both sides of a jungle match-up and no one felt attacked.
rbuhil,hnqdlg8,hnqdlg8,2022 Vitality roster,arbori1,12/08/2021,1,>  while looking for a scapegoat for another 3-3 run in groups  imagine ur jungler camps top whole game support camps top whole game and you get 1v1 killed after getting an insane lead handed to you and throw the game. Truly a  scapegoat
rbuhil,hnqh4ur,hnqh4ur,2022 Vitality roster,geos121,12/08/2021,1,only thing i ever disliked about alphari was his twitter likes (seems to be against the vax? or mandates? ) but hes a super solid laner and won tl way more games than he lost

rbuhil,hnqg0j0,hnqg0j0,2022 Vitality roster,Duality_NA,12/08/2021,1,I mean music is subjective right? For the record I also think it’s trash but EDM is an extremely popular genre of music. Makes total sense why they’d use it
rbuhil,hnqk7ng,hnqk7ng,2022 Vitality roster,Callum2302,12/08/2021,1,It ain’t that bad though it does sound tinny but that could be my fault. Rather have this than some shit pop track that no one will care about in 2 months.
rbuhil,hnqj8ut,hnqj8ut,2022 Vitality roster,1einspieler,12/08/2021,1,I don‘t even want to know what you‘re listening too if you think this is horrible
rbuhil,hnqfunm,hnqfunm,2022 Vitality roster,Karlsefni1,12/08/2021,1,I’m pretty sure he was already rated highly by people in the scene not so much by the fans.
rbuhil,hnqgi4y,hnqgi4y,2022 Vitality roster,EwOkLuKe,12/08/2021,1,Yeah anybody that was closely watching LEC were really hyped by giving MikyX a real roster to work with.  He was extremly highly rated by experts (players/coaches/analysts)
rbuhil,hnqizwy,hnqizwy,2022 Vitality roster,Pokegamesunited,12/08/2021,1,Im gonna have to disagree with you on the carzzy being better than ADC perkz maybe it was the meta suiting him perfectly but perkz was a fkn monster on the AD role in 2019
rbuhil,hnqjie8,hnqjie8,2022 Vitality roster,itgmechiel,12/08/2021,1,Wunder was the best top laner in the world in 2019/2020
rbuhil,hnqju5h,hnqju5h,2022 Vitality roster,firehydrant_man,12/08/2021,1,alphari is barely half what was prime 2019 wunderperkz ADC is also better than current carzzy by miles and the reason perkz role swapped in the first place was because he believed caps was the way better midlanerthis roster is on paper way worse than 2019 G2not even close
rbuhil,hnqfb8k,hnqfb8k,2022 Vitality roster,AnxiousEzrael,12/08/2021,1,BDS obviously   They have ummm...Adam I think and that Nuclear guy
rbuhil,hnqgre4,hnqgre4,2022 Vitality roster,bin_fanboy9,12/08/2021,1,Fnatic is clearly the best
rbuhil,hnqfjx9,hnqfjx9,2022 Vitality roster,MoredhelEUW,12/08/2021,1,Fnatic looks damn good ! I am not even biaised btw  G2 also kept a strong top side  I would say that FNC/G2/VIT might share the top3 player in top jungle mid but FNC has the strongest botlane  For G2 & VIT I wont rate them until I see them in action
rbuhil,hnqfi2n,hnqfi2n,2022 Vitality roster,Darkfire293,12/08/2021,1,FNC? They have a worse top but better in every other position
rbuhil,hnqff2u,hnqff2u,2022 Vitality roster,WeslleyM,12/08/2021,1,FNC?
rbuhil,hnqk6h1,hnqk6h1,2022 Vitality roster,LionePRO,12/08/2021,1,They could have wrote one of the best
rbuhil,hnqemcx,hnqemcx,2022 Vitality roster,DonGudnason,12/08/2021,1,Gargantuan if verifiable
rbuhil,hnqert7,hnqert7,2022 Vitality roster,Leema1,12/08/2021,1,Gargantuan if correct
rbuhil,hnqh50b,hnqh50b,2022 Vitality roster,ZXKeyr324XZ,12/08/2021,1,There are precedents of players playing much better when coming back to EU from NA (Nisqy BB) so I expect Perkz to really get back on his former level.  Selfmade at his peak performace Id say is better than Razork but I feel like Razork is more consistently good Selfmade still was pretty much the reason VIT made playoffs and almost won against FNC
rbuhil,hnqh1cd,hnqh1cd,2022 Vitality roster,inde99,12/08/2021,1,I dont deny that Alphari as a player is heavily focused around playing strongside and that the laning phase is his strongest point. Even if hes not as good in teamfights or midgame macro hes got Perkz and Carzzy in the team for a reason. Also while I agree that if a player gets a lot of focus and he fails to carry he should be blamed we should also aknowledge that there might be a reason if said team decided to give resources to that player and not others. Unless we want to do some absolute nonsense and say that G2 vs RNG 2018 game 5 is Uzis fault because he couldnt carry with a fed Sivir...  >Like the last game with ego picking Jayce when tank would be a better option only to fail miserably  I assume youre talking about the tiebreker vs GenG here. And they indeed hovered the Sion in draft. But again looking at stats from Worlds Jayce and Graves (and Kennen) absolutely dominate the top lane meta. The first real tanks I found are Grags (with 4 picks and 50% wr) and Malphite (3 picks 33% wr). Tanks simply werent that good in the meta in general.
rbuhil,hnqevna,hnqevna,2022 Vitality roster,LasergunPiuPiu,12/08/2021,1,I think this is partly true but might change with the new TP changes making laning in top more important than ever.
rbuhil,hnqjpo7,hnqjpo7,2022 Vitality roster,Waylaand,12/08/2021,1,No one was playing tanks last worlds

rbuhil,hnqd2gl,hnqd2gl,2022 Vitality roster,ArjunBanerji27,12/08/2021,1,Didnt you know? Selfmade is the reason why Fnatic boomed in Spring and Rekkles ditched last year.
rbuhil,hnqgbcv,hnqgbcv,2022 Vitality roster,NamikazeEU,12/08/2021,1,In rosters where u dont need supp to be shotcaller where u have perkz/Jankos  Mikyx is a blessing. In roster where no one shot calls  u dont need a muted mechanical support..
rbuhil,hnqj4w9,hnqj4w9,2022 Vitality roster,bin_fanboy9,12/08/2021,1,Same thing happened with Hylissang back in UOL and Labrov this year. Both criminally underrated players. People are absolutely clueless when it comes to evaluating supports.
rbuhil,hnqgu8b,hnqgu8b,2022 Vitality roster,NamikazeEU,12/08/2021,1,U do realize fans cant see much outside the official games.    Its the same thing where u folks yearly mock the Year of the duck while entire European scene keep saying Nukeduck was godtier player.
rbuhil,hnqjcjd,hnqjcjd,2022 Vitality roster,AconexOfficial,12/08/2021,1,yeah in that 2019 meta adc Perkz  was a lot better than Carrzy is now
rbuhil,hnqjzqj,hnqjzqj,2022 Vitality roster,Marcoscb,12/08/2021,1,Carzzy now is better than Perkz was at this point of the season. You cant compre Carzzy now to Perkz at Worlds or in Summer with a full season of development.
rbuhil,hnqjauo,hnqjauo,2022 Vitality roster,Baldoora,12/08/2021,1,Adam is THE player to follow  ^^^on ^^^Twitter
rbuhil,hnqh49t,hnqh49t,2022 Vitality roster,NamikazeEU,12/08/2021,1,Are u really placing Brokenblade in same category as Wunder/Alphari ?    I understand people are G2 fans but idk man outside Caps/Jankos  I dont see that much hype yet of G2 roster.
rbuhil,hnqgwoq,hnqgwoq,2022 Vitality roster,OnlyElise,12/08/2021,1,I dont think Wunder is worse than Alphari Wunders last year wasnt his best one but what did Alphari really do? Most of the time he laned 2v1 with Core roaming top got a CS lead at 15 and didnt do anything with it after.
rbuhil,hnqh1sa,hnqh1sa,2022 Vitality roster,thefalc0ns,12/08/2021,1,Lmao people about to get a reality check on why Perkz is unquestionably the western goat.  Also razork isn’t better than selfmade.
rbuhil,hnqgmp9,hnqgmp9,2022 Vitality roster,revoverlord,12/08/2021,1,Humongous if accurate
rbuhil,hnqhxp3,hnqhxp3,2022 Vitality roster,Mythik16,12/08/2021,1,>Selfmade still was pretty much the reason VIT made playoffs and almost won against FNC  Razork was the reason MSF were 4th and why they nearly beat Rogue and FNC. But I agree with the Perkz point.
rbuhil,hnqjl4r,hnqjl4r,2022 Vitality roster,sznfrk,12/08/2021,1,> There are precedents of players playing much better when coming back to EU from NA (Nisqy BB)  What  Nisqy has been at literally the same level for the last 4 or 5 years. The only thing that changes community perception of him is insanely biased EU fans. Look at how people were talking about him before worlds like some god gamer top 2 EU mid or something. Then guess what? He does exactly what he did at Worlds the last times he attended with the exact same champs lmao.  BB wasnt any better in EU than he was in NA his team was just worse so he looked better relatively.
rbuhil,hnqj85q,hnqj85q,2022 Vitality roster,sznfrk,12/08/2021,1,> Even if hes not as good in teamfights or midgame macro hes got Perkz and Carzzy in the team for a reason.   Based on Worlds performance this is not a significant difference from Jensen and Tactical.  Except now he wont have CoreJJ laning with him.  Alphari gets a million excuses because people get hyped up over his laning stats and KP. He was getting babysat by CoreJJ and Santorin. Theres a reason CoreJJ had the lowest bot proximity.  The meta becomes kind of irrelevant if youre last pick into a triple AD threat team and all you have to do is survive laning phase.   > Also while I agree that if a player gets a lot of focus and he fails to carry he should be blamed we should also aknowledge that there might be a reason if said team decided to give resources to that player and not others.   Have you seen what happens to Alphari when he doesnt get pick priority and handholding? Hes a mediocre to poor tank player.
rbuhil,hnqgbbr,hnqgbbr,2022 Vitality roster,firechaox,12/08/2021,1,Can you link me alphari actually having late game impact any game?
rbuhil,hnqgdr0,hnqgdr0,2022 Vitality roster,arbori1,12/08/2021,1,alphari died 1v1 way before that and game was over
rbuhil,hnqje6v,hnqje6v,2022 Vitality roster,EwOkLuKe,12/08/2021,1,No anyone watching Mixyx and arent complete newbie to bot meta could tell he was a step above anyone but top tier supports eventually.  I mean im by no mean a prophet or genius but i could tell mikyx was nuts even when he was in Splyce and especially on misfits.  thats when he caught my attention then he joined G2 and my tits were all over the place gotta admit.  Im also a Support and ADC main so i know what to look for in a support i wouldnt be able to tell that easily if it was for a toplaner or mid laners as theres some micro details i might completly miss.
rbuhil,hnqhspk,hnqhspk,2022 Vitality roster,Salmon_Slap,12/08/2021,1,Bb penta kill g2 last year  In a more serious tone he did perform very fucking good last year despite how shit his team were.
rbuhil,hnqhvhg,hnqhvhg,2022 Vitality roster,_Rose_and_Crown_,12/08/2021,1,Maybe not with Wunder but I could see BB losing lane to Alphari but doing just enough to stay in the game and carrying through team fights. I feel like that matchup could go either way tbh. Because Alphari has god-tier laning but BB just has really good team fight plays. Kind of like Impact vs Alphari.
rbuhil,hnqh68i,hnqh68i,2022 Vitality roster,Darkfire293,12/08/2021,1,Wunder was a mid tier top in LEC when LEC didn’t even have good tops. Alphari was second in MVP voting in Spring lol. In Summer he didn’t play much and then he went back to destroying everyone in Playoffs.
rbuhil,hnqiic5,hnqiic5,2022 Vitality roster,NamikazeEU,12/08/2021,1,G2 is not going for a mediocre run.    Can the dude keep up against likes of Zoom/TheShy/Bin/Xiaohu/Flandre ? If u cant u are huge liability.
rbuhil,hnqhu5x,hnqhu5x,2022 Vitality roster,OnlyElise,12/08/2021,1,Obviously Alphari is a great laner probably the best in the west but he doesnt use his lead well after laning phase and its pretty easy to look good if you play with Santorin/Jensen/CoreJJ playing around you in LCS. Im not saying Wunder>Alphari i just dont think you can say Alphari>Wunder either but time will tell.
rbuhil,hnqjxoi,hnqjxoi,2022 Vitality roster,Rhaxar,12/08/2021,1,Everyone can keep up with TheShy the guy runs it down on cooldown.
rbuhil,hnqj84t,hnqj84t,2022 Vitality roster,Waylaand,12/08/2021,1,He looked good on the 10th placed team in LEC playing against a better Wunder and Bwipo this is such an overblown narrative. Alphari > Wunder pretty definitively last year
rbuhil,hnqjxc5,hnqjxc5,2022 Vitality roster,OnlyElise,12/08/2021,1,Well yes hes a good laner. His team still finished 10th for a reason.
rbuhil,hnqkjkd,hnqkjkd,2022 Vitality roster,CutestKidInTown,12/08/2021,1,Im eager to see if carzzy and selfmade can carry 2 retired players to the lec title.
rbuhil,hnqkm0s,hnqkm0s,2022 Vitality roster,Calamity25,12/08/2021,1,I can guarantee this roster comes top 10 in Spring and Summer!
rbuhil,hnqkow4,hnqkow4,2022 Vitality roster,JuliusCitrus,12/08/2021,1,Perkz was a beast on spring playoffs in 2021 and from then on he decayed to mediocre/ above average level maybe it was due to realising even subconsciously that cloud9 couldnt really contend for what he wanted.   We will see this year if he returns to his previous all time great form.   But at least we know this is a team he fully chose because of ambition and not because he didnt have another option.
rbuhil,hnqkr50,hnqkr50,2022 Vitality roster,Ziraelus,12/08/2021,1,Perkz is washed af Alphari is good domestically but below average internationally Selfmade is up and down and bot is meh. No idea where this superteam comes from
rbuhil,hnqkxcr,hnqkxcr,2022 Vitality roster,gmsantos3,12/08/2021,1,>The biggest LEC roster ever seen we gathered the best EU players.  Excuse me the what?  They are great for sure. But only Perkz can be considered the best...
rbuhil,hnql39d,hnql39d,2022 Vitality roster,JuliusCitrus,12/08/2021,1,Tell me guys what was Wunder form this past year?   Funny all the FNC fans think they are getting 2019 wunder but asume for sure Perkz cant reach his 2019 form.
rbuhil,hnqkgk6,hnqkgk6,2022 Vitality roster,BagelJ,12/08/2021,1,People are really overrating this roster.   Selfmade was 5th best jungler last year. Carrzy was 3rd best adc and perkz and alphari wasnt even the best in their role in NA so lets say ~3rd. (perkz played dreadful before worlds but after humanoid and caps the other mids are pretty underwhelming so lets say third). And labrov was like 5th best support.  So its a team of 3-5s. Its not really that exciting.  Still think theyll get an easy top 3 since EU is looking budget af next split.
rbuhil,hnql6xx,hnql6xx,2022 Vitality roster,ghostekmen,12/08/2021,1,Although selfmade is fairly decent jungler for LEC standards he is yet to prove his skills internationally. While jankos has consistently proven to be a huge factor in every international tournament that he has attended(well maybe except 2015 iem).
rbuhil,hnql9zh,hnql9zh,2022 Vitality roster,Noziro,12/08/2021,1,Youre contradicting yourself. Vitality is adding Carzzy Perkz Alphari versus G2 adding Caps Miky Wunder.   VIT is definitely adding the bigger names as they stand currently. Wunder and Miky only gained status for what they achieved on G2 not before
rbuhil,hnqlbar,hnqlbar,2022 Vitality roster,getfreakywithmeok,12/08/2021,1,How is razork better than selfmade? They almost beat FNC thanks to him last split and selfmade was top1 jungle in the west at some point razork on the other thand? what are his achievements?
rbuhil,hnqklqu,hnqklqu,2022 Vitality roster,Darkfire293,12/08/2021,1,Being good in 2018 and 2019 doesn’t mean he’s better than Humanoid in 2022. He’s flat out worse.
rbuhil,hnql335,hnql335,2022 Vitality roster,Darkfire293,12/08/2021,1,Yeah like wtf are people talking about? Nisqy and BB both won LCS in 2020 lol. They were never bad
rbuhil,hnqkp30,hnqkp30,2022 Vitality roster,Darkfire293,12/08/2021,1,Because his team sucked?
rbuhil,hnqlrtk,hnqlrtk,2022 Vitality roster,TheBlurgh,12/08/2021,1,> The biggest LEC roster ever seen we gathered the best EU players.   Umm... what?  First of all lets cool down with the Alphari hype. His last two years were standing out in a mess of a roster and then stomping lane phase in NA then not being able to translate it into anything.  Selfmade is far from being the best EU jungler lol.  Perkz... It can be argued. Although I guess people still rate Caps higher.  Carzzy is not the best EU adc at all.  And Labrov... bruv.  So chill VIT chill.
rbuhil,hnqlyq5,hnqlyq5,2022 Vitality roster,bayernale,12/08/2021,1,I disagree the G2 2020 roster on paper for sure was bigger (at least on paper). At the beginning of this year everyone (maybe apart from Mikyx) was considered the best in his role. But maybe this Vitality iteration will be more successful because of Perkz buff. On the other hand I think one could argue that FNC has an even better roster than Vitality. Nevertheless LEC ist gonna be HYPE for sure!
rbuhil,hnqld8b,hnqld8b,2022 Vitality roster,xxlongdog420xx,12/08/2021,1,Hype roster but that video is so cringe lmao the fake screaming is extremely soy

rbuhil,hnqmgvg,hnqmgvg,2022 Vitality roster,AofCastle,12/08/2021,1,Its big but I doubt its as big as G2 these last 3 years. I do hope they do well.
rbuhil,hnqmygl,hnqmygl,2022 Vitality roster,Anarchontologist,12/08/2021,1,Decent.  Will probably take a couple games off an OK Asian team at Worlds but then proceed to get nuked by Selfmade getting turbo clowned on and the bot lane just being way too mediocre internationally.   Always depend on some Perkz inting. And Alphari will diva it up when shit is going south.  Cant wait for all this to happen and reddit trying to act ignorant about it going over every speculative bullshit scenario on why.
rbuhil,hnqmdcy,hnqmdcy,2022 Vitality roster,Sersch,12/08/2021,1,Well they wrote biggest not best. Whatever that means. Like do they have a lot of subs?
rbuhil,hnqlzxz,hnqlzxz,2022 Vitality roster,MintyHippo30,12/08/2021,1,Theres no way Selfmade can tilt when both mid and bot will be losing almost every lane phase!
rbuhil,hnqlqa0,hnqlqa0,2022 Vitality roster,getfreakywithmeok,12/08/2021,1,5th best jungler? xD they almost beat fnatic thanks to him. also he was top1 jungler in the west at some point. how are u hyping razork? what are his achievements to date?
rbuhil,hnqmiaf,hnqmiaf,2022 Vitality roster,getfxud,12/08/2021,1,...and yet here we are having to live with the knowledge that you are an Excel fan.
rbuhil,hnqmx10,hnqmx10,2022 Vitality roster,Passi1612,12/08/2021,1,bruh. Did you watch 2019 worlds? Wunder got shit on every game including group stage and Caps and Perkz two man carried that team to the finals. Lets not even talk about 2020 where he played better but still pretty horrible.  Lets not talk about best toplaner in the world he didnt even look barely good at worlds. He even looked bad against licorice let alone Nuguri Khan and Sword.  The only good international tournament he had was MSI 2019
rbuhil,hnqmmbv,hnqmmbv,2022 Vitality roster,ahambagaplease,12/08/2021,1,Mikyx had a bit of doubts tho since he came of a really bad playoffs performance especially the series against Splyce.
rbuhil,hnqlzyq,hnqlzyq,2022 Vitality roster,Karlsefni1,12/08/2021,1,Wunder was already part of G2 when Miky and Caps joined. I think you are right about Miky but the reason why 2019 G2 was so hype was because both Caps and Perkz were coming back from 2 separate really good worlds runs.  I don’t think this Vit roster can achieve the same amount of excitement.
rbuhil,hnqlqv6,hnqlqv6,2022 Vitality roster,CuteTao,12/08/2021,1,Adam actually apologized for everything but the video isnt allowed to be posted here
rbuhil,hnqmblh,hnqmblh,2022 Vitality roster,Vantablack9,12/08/2021,1,Not a G2 fan but if BB clicks with Caps and Jankos G2 could easily have the best top side in the league

rbuhil,hnqlnkd,hnqlnkd,2022 Vitality roster,Kurumi_Tokisaki,12/08/2021,1,We will see if perkz plays like he did in NA it’ll mask alphari’s problems till worlds where real tops gap him even if he gets a 20 cs lead but well see who knows maybe he learned which be nice too so then EU gets a stronger top to train the others.
rbuhil,hnqm7h4,hnqm7h4,2022 Vitality roster,OnlyElise,12/08/2021,1,A truly great player can carry his team to not finish 10th in regular season especially if you have Upset as your botlaner. If toplane in LEC is that bad why did he not capitalize on it? This is like the tenth time im typing this but Alphari is a great laner and good player in general i just dont think you can definitely say Alphari>Wunder when predicting next years perfomance.

Being the best top in the west doesn’t mean shit when the level of western tops are currently ass. Alphari is arguably worse than Alphari from last year(or 2017). Wunder in 2019 was arguably the best in the world for the first half(or at least 2nd to TheShy)  > Selfmade I think is on par with jankos so again no Perkz and caps are similar skill but its probably slightly caps favored. Carzzy is better than perkz adc imo although it could go to either  What the fuck did you just type out...
rbuhil,hnqokgz,hnqokgz,2022 Vitality roster,Xonra,12/08/2021,1,Cant wait for a spring so EU fans see how overhyped Alphari is all over again so they stop pretending this and repeating this narrative. He was great for 50% of Spring Split on TL fell off when he got figured out then divas out and stopped trying.
rbuhil,hnqnfmn,hnqnfmn,2022 Vitality roster,Vantablack9,12/08/2021,1,Well the two big teams are overhyped tbh. Fnatic has the best botlane but Wunder is still a question mark about if he will be able to play like used to and Razork is good but we still dont know if hes a top jungler
rbuhil,hnqne6f,hnqne6f,2022 Vitality roster,RudiGarcia,12/08/2021,1,Fnatic
rbuhil,hnqojlc,hnqojlc,2022 Vitality roster,MrPraedor,12/08/2021,1,Fnatic.   Bot and Mid are better for FNC at the moment.   Jungle can be quite much 50/50 with both beimg good.  Top is in favour of VIT but Wunder can still match if he gets back from his slump from last year.
rbuhil,hnqo904,hnqo904,2022 Vitality roster,1einspieler,12/08/2021,1,He had a pretty poor Worlds performance and was benched for half of the Summer season so already worse than his 2020 in EU
rbuhil,hnqny2d,hnqny2d,2022 Vitality roster,WaveCore,12/08/2021,1,Obviously its always subjective but dubstep specifically I do not think is popular at all atm was maybe like 6 years ago
rbuhil,hnqnbc9,hnqnbc9,2022 Vitality roster,AnnieNotAndy,12/08/2021,1,Nah its bad. Sounds like generic shit that would be used in a commercial for protein powder or exercise equipment.
rbuhil,hnqnb3n,hnqnb3n,2022 Vitality roster,Icy_Wear_4610,12/08/2021,1,It was fairly obvious to me at the time that G2 would be cracked. I started watching LEC after I heard the announcement
rbuhil,hnqnc6s,hnqnc6s,2022 Vitality roster,BagelJ,12/08/2021,1,well obviously the list is subjective. and selfmade has better peaks but razork was rated higher by many in summer and considering fnc replaced selfmade with and autofill  and then razork he hasnt exactly had an excellent recent trend.
rbuhil,hnqnnuv,hnqnnuv,2022 Vitality roster,srukta,12/08/2021,1,> I dont deny that Alphari as a player is heavily focused around playing strongside  Alphari was getting leads alone while xerxe went to other lanes in 10th place origen.
rbuhil,hnqnmgc,hnqnmgc,2022 Vitality roster,SanderG_Ad4445,12/08/2021,1,insert selfmade meme
rbuhil,hnqn1bt,hnqn1bt,2022 Vitality roster,1einspieler,12/08/2021,1,Looks like my taste of music is unfortunately better than my favourite LEC team
rbuhil,hnqo3rs,hnqo3rs,2022 Vitality roster,MrPraedor,12/08/2021,1,Being western goat =/= best western mid coming to 2022.
rbuhil,hnqnpip,hnqnpip,2022 Vitality roster,Saxazz,12/08/2021,1,I think both are comparable.
rbuhil,hnqnx83,hnqnx83,2022 Vitality roster,Noziro,12/08/2021,1,Perhaps not only time will tell but in terms of Vitality adding players at the peak of their renown/fame then I think this VIT roster is the most ambitious ever done in EU and I can see why theyre marketing it as such.
rbuhil,hnqndkb,hnqndkb,2022 Vitality roster,PM_ME_CAMILLE_ART,12/08/2021,1,He said based off the last worlds bruh. Clearly you do not know how to read in the first place.
rbuhil,hnqolax,hnqolax,2022 Vitality roster,Plaxern,12/08/2021,1,No one in a Western team can(also don’t list TheShy there) at least the ones that showed up at Worlds(Armut Fudge Alphari Odo Adam Ssumday) couldn’t.   Their best bet currently is BB and HiRit(both of whom were the best carry toplaners last LEC season but didn’t make Worlds.
rbuhil,hnqn1aj,hnqn1aj,2022 Vitality roster,getfreakywithmeok,12/08/2021,1,once again selfmade proved himself many times LEC finals worlds. What are razork achievements so far to make him better jgl than selfmade
rbuhil,hnqoy91,hnqoy91,2022 Vitality roster,Riven2main,12/08/2021,1,I think this is the second best LEC roster ever seen just behind the G2 roster of 2019/2020 since do believe that Perkz especially in the 2019 meta together with Mikyx was just a better bot lane and I would also give the edge to Caps and Jankos.
rbuhil,hnqp9i8,hnqp9i8,2022 Vitality roster,Gengar_Balanced,12/08/2021,1,Welp with Perkz coming back to Europe and Inspired leaving its time for a new flair.
rbuhil,hnqphpo,hnqphpo,2022 Vitality roster,DogTheGayFish,12/08/2021,1,Vitality content team still sucks woohoo
rbuhil,hnqplj5,hnqplj5,2022 Vitality roster,WorstLeonaEUW,12/08/2021,1,The biggest LEC Roster ever seen? If you compare just the names G2 with Wunder Jankos Caps Rekkles Miky was waaaay more bigger.
rbuhil,hnqpykm,hnqpykm,2022 Vitality roster,azaza34,12/08/2021,1,This team wont do nearly as good as people expect. I am gyessing they will look good early spring and by playoffs eill be struggling. They will end third.
rbuhil,hnqpuhd,hnqpuhd,2022 Vitality roster,deathman105,12/08/2021,1,all the leaks were 100 percent spot on right
rbuhil,hnqpk1b,hnqpk1b,2022 Vitality roster,Xonra,12/08/2021,1,I mean Selfmade and Alphari alone would cause mental boom if they dont do well. Alphari showed his true diva colors in NA as If people already forgot? Everyone pretends he is the best western top laner when he wasnt even the best top laner in NA after the start of Spring Split.
rbuhil,hnqpa7b,hnqpa7b,2022 Vitality roster,Darkconsume,12/08/2021,1,People are still sleeping on Vander smh
rbuhil,hnqpuui,hnqpuui,2022 Vitality roster,IqMqsd,12/08/2021,1,He is 19 but not a rookie this is his 4th split in LEC.
rbuhil,hnqowpu,hnqowpu,2022 Vitality roster,Hannig4n,12/08/2021,1,Both current Alphari or current Selfmade are definitely worse than 2019 Wunder and Jankos. Same for current Perkz and Carzzy compared to Caps and Perkz back in 2019.
rbuhil,hnqpxew,hnqpxew,2022 Vitality roster,Bhiggsb,12/08/2021,1,Really? What teams were he on?
rbuhil,hnqotwv,hnqotwv,2022 Vitality roster,D3monFight3,12/08/2021,1,Is EDM that popular right now? Because it seems like that is not the case anymore sure its probably decently popular but not super mainstream popular like how it was at the peak with David Guetta having constant radio hits.
rbuhil,hnqpfsp,hnqpfsp,2022 Vitality roster,Conankun66,12/08/2021,1,i dont have anything against EDM as a whole but this is a pretty terrible piece of EDM
rbuhil,hnqpxw2,hnqpxw2,2022 Vitality roster,shepherdhunt,12/08/2021,1,I would argue that selfmade could be much worse than razork. Razork does need time to grow more but if control and lane assisting junglers are in then selfmade gets a major nerf. Seems like he needs xin Zhao Olaf and Evelynn to be strong. My opinion watching him during season. Havent gotten the chance to see him stream much sadly.
rbuhil,hnqps65,hnqps65,2022 Vitality roster,getfreakywithmeok,12/08/2021,1,I dont think they replaced selfmade bc of his  skill/gameplay but rather his view of the game and way of communicating with team
rbuhil,hnqp7dg,hnqp7dg,2022 Vitality roster,Gengar_Balanced,12/08/2021,1,Welp to one up G2 2019 roster theyd have to either win worlds or be in finals twice in a row. Also dont forget that G2 won MSI I dont think they can match it its way harder now Still hyped tho.
rbuhil,hnqpu2s,hnqpu2s,2022 Vitality roster,Plaxern,12/08/2021,1,Faker’s macro is a lot better than Chovy’s IMO.
rbuhil,hnqotib,hnqotib,2022 Vitality roster,sznfrk,12/08/2021,1,Yeah its a bit unfair seeing as Jensen has never thrown a 5k gold lead by getting caught literally 5 times in a row on Ryze who has a convenient escape  Then you have Carzzy who couldnt even make groups when he played against Tactical and then split 1-1 with him this year both ending with the same 3-3 scoreline  But let me guess because Perkz and Carzzy have played the majority of their careers in EU and you have an LEC flair you lack both the objectivity and brainpower necessary to draw parallels between the two pairs.
rbuhil,hnqp7zj,hnqp7zj,2022 Vitality roster,CuteTao,12/08/2021,1,Mods trying to get people to hate Adam is the only reason I can think of
rbuhil,hnqp6ag,hnqp6ag,2022 Vitality roster,FakerGOATandBEST,12/08/2021,1,TheShit cant keep up with anyone from LEC/LCS/LCK. Hell run it down faster than Usain Bolt.
rbuhil,hnqphdo,hnqphdo,2022 Vitality roster,Plaxern,12/08/2021,1,Toplane in LEC wasn’t bad that season toplane in LEC this season however. Although not 10th Chovy did place 8th just last split and he’s arguably one of the best players in the world rated as high by most analysts and pro players.   As for your Upset point LEC’s ADC pool was/is insane and is definitely EU’s most competitive and best role having Upset alone doesn’t mean much(especially with Destiny as his support).  I don’t think Alphari will be necessarily better than Wunder next year but you’re really undermining Alphari’s performance in 2020.
rbuhil,hnqotx2,hnqotx2,2022 Vitality roster,stoner_munchies420,12/08/2021,1,I can see this roster being same as Misfit 2019 super roster
rbuhil,hnqqpgg,hnqqpgg,2022 Vitality roster,IcePokeTwoSoon,12/08/2021,1,Biggest roster my butt g2 thinks this is hilarious
rbuhil,hnqqqw6,hnqqqw6,2022 Vitality roster,THE_MUNDO_TRAIN,12/08/2021,1,Tbh Im mostly hyped for Labrov more than anything here this guy has been carried both his gonads and his teammates in the past.
rbuhil,hnqra88,hnqra88,2022 Vitality roster,sanketower,12/08/2021,1,Watch this roster implode as Alphari and Selfmade kill each other
rbuhil,hnqrrno,hnqrrno,2022 Vitality roster,Idontcareforkarma3,12/08/2021,1,Ego ego
rbuhil,hnqru1t,hnqru1t,2022 Vitality roster,Potkrokin,12/08/2021,1,A super team isnt a super team if half the roster is mediocre and the other half hasnt been top in their role for more than a year. Perkz and Carzzy are ridiculously overrated and theyll do decently before falling apart in Summer.
rbuhil,hnqs0gx,hnqs0gx,2022 Vitality roster,orangezuice,12/08/2021,1,I still remember knowing nothing about Labrov but when watching his game even his team losing his Bard was truly something else.
rbuhil,hnqrnka,hnqrnka,2022 Vitality roster,kapparino-feederino,12/08/2021,1,Top 2 in LEC? who would u consider the best then?
rbuhil,hnqqyig,hnqqyig,2022 Vitality roster,carIton,12/08/2021,1,Imo the best roster on paper in Europa was G2 in 2020. Wunder Jankos Caps Rekkles Miky were all player who you could argue for being the best in their role. Also it was even the biggest disappointment. 😅
rbuhil,hnqq9vy,hnqq9vy,2022 Vitality roster,Hannig4n,12/08/2021,1,Well titanic is also just a regular word that means really strong/big basically the adjective form of “titan.”  Like thats why they gave the boat that name because of what the word meant.
rbuhil,hnqrar8,hnqrar8,2022 Vitality roster,okokokok1111,12/08/2021,1,>wins MSI  Sounds good enough to me after this years disappointing overall performance
rbuhil,hnqq4ac,hnqq4ac,2022 Vitality roster,SupaHotGuava,12/08/2021,1,Hum ADC perkz ?
rbuhil,hnqqan4,hnqqan4,2022 Vitality roster,weirdchocolatedonut,12/08/2021,1,because nothing else has worked for the past decade and teams have only tried a handful of superteams in the last decade there has been MAYBE 3 western teams that were considered superteams other dominant eu teams didnt have the superteam brand behind it the players just played out of their minds.
rbuhil,hnqqbkq,hnqqbkq,2022 Vitality roster,Vantablack9,12/08/2021,1,People forgot how many people were having doubts about the G2 roster. A lot of G2 fans were going crazy about how it was going to work people talking about how Perkz was going to waste his talent on the botlane people not understanding why Caps would leave the best EU team at the time to join a roster with such a weird decision people blaming G2 for trying to get the best two mids so no other team can have them etc.   Of course the announcement was one of the biggest surprises weve had in the league but the general opinion wasnt that it was going to be the best team in EU. Rekkles leaving to G2 was way bigger on terms of what people expected from that team
rbuhil,hnqq3ey,hnqq3ey,2022 Vitality roster,Xonra,12/08/2021,1,More like EU fans ignoring glaring issues to mock NA while ignoring Alphari throwing worlds cause he didnt care and wanted out. He legit threw at least 2 games by himself and the last one in champ select. He wasnt even the best top laner in NA and outside of the lock in tournament he fell off and his champ pool shriveled.
rbuhil,hnqqc11,hnqqc11,2022 Vitality roster,Ursuped,12/08/2021,1,Treatz
rbuhil,hnqqzcw,hnqqzcw,2022 Vitality roster,Taivasvaeltaja,12/08/2021,1,I do agree with you people overrating this roster although Im bit higher on rankings than you.   * I do consider Selfmade the 2nd best jungler in 2021 LEC he really did drag that VIT roster to the playoffs.  * Perkz is big ??? he might very well be 5th best mid this year.  * Alphari I have large hopes for and wouldnt be surprised at all if he is the #1 top laner.  * Carzzy is just really solid. Upset is likely bit better but I dont see any other adc contesting for the top spot. * Labrov... Well he looked good even with the worst ADC in the league so I wouldnt be surprised if he is rated #1 support in 2022. I also wouldnt be surprised if he is rated #7.
rbuhil,hnqqk2k,hnqqk2k,2022 Vitality roster,Xonra,12/08/2021,1,Except it was him that kept them from getting out cause of his shitty ego pick he couldnt even perform on. Jensen was carrying TL at worlds while Alphari looked like he gave zero shits.  TL doing how they did was inspite of Alphari not because of Alphari. You clearly didnt watch TL at worlds to think otherwise.
rbuhil,hnqq0sg,hnqq0sg,2022 Vitality roster,MyDeicide,12/08/2021,1,Yeah Labrov has a long way to go before hes a superteam player
rbuhil,hnqr44q,hnqr44q,2022 Vitality roster,Aladin001,12/08/2021,1,Wunder was never the best top itw because his peak overlapped with TheShys
rbuhil,hnqq253,hnqq253,2022 Vitality roster,DisastrousZone,12/08/2021,1,He wasnt even top 2 in his group at worlds either of those years. Then you have to consider that LPL has 7-8 tops that are better without a doubt and LCK has 4-6 depending on how you rate certain players.
rbuhil,hnqqi1r,hnqqi1r,2022 Vitality roster,shepherdhunt,12/08/2021,1,I feel like this is the way to view it. Razork could be top 3 jungler in EU wunder needs to prove he can be a great player still. But when the comparison between selfmade and razork comes up I would take razork for the potential highs and control style versus selfmades hypercarry only style.
rbuhil,hnqrkxe,hnqrkxe,2022 Vitality roster,Jiigsi,12/08/2021,1,Vitality only BIG from German league before

rbuhil,hnqqquz,hnqqquz,2022 Vitality roster,JealotGaming,12/08/2021,1,Yeah its a bit unfair seeing as Perkz has never thrown a game 5 by getting caught and not ulting on Ekko who has a convenient escape  Then you have Tactical who couldnt even make it out of groups two years in a row when he played against Carzzy and Perkz ending with a 3-3 scoreline both times  But let me guess you made this comment because the other guy has an LEC flair and you need a reason to be butthurt about EU fans for the nth time this week?
rbuhil,hnqqsde,hnqqsde,2022 Vitality roster,OhanaMeansFamily69,12/08/2021,1,fnatic fans changed the narrative on here FAST about adam/wunder lmfaoo
rbuhil,hnqrlw9,hnqrlw9,2022 Vitality roster,sznfrk,12/08/2021,1,You guys are actually so insecure from hyping up EU teams as top 4 in the world only for them to struggle in a group with CN4 LCS2 and KR points qualifier and then barely win a tiebreaker game.  It really shows with how rabidly you defend every single EU player any time someone suggests they arent the greatest to ever do it.   Carzzy and Tactical are literally as close as you can get in terms of performance this worlds. Tactical personally knocked Carzzy out in playins last year despite shitpicking Twitch. Cope harder mald bald etc.   Maybe you shouldnt construct your entire ego and online persona on being better than NA because the cognitive dissonance when NA is 3-2 up over EU with the same number of teams out is just sad. Look at how fuming you all are in this thread. NOOO you cant just say Perkz had a bad year it was NA!!!! NOOO you cant just point out that Alphari looked good because CoreJJ camped his lane!!@!@!@!@!  Jesus christ lmao. Youve read and posted so many low-effort lul NA bad TSM bad that you actually started to believe the stuff you wrote.
rbuhil,hnqsujy,hnqsujy,2022 Vitality roster,Domermac,12/08/2021,1,It’s definitely a sweet lineup but in no way is it the biggest LEC roster ever seen
rbuhil,hnqsv8u,hnqsv8u,2022 Vitality roster,LessyLuLovesYou,12/08/2021,1,is labrov better than mikyx?      alternatively why labrov over kaiser? I thought bot lane time spent together meant something....
rbuhil,hnqsw1v,hnqsw1v,2022 Vitality roster,FNCYuna,12/08/2021,1,Its a shame they are on Vitality until now they barely did ANY lol content and based on this announcement video in 144p Im not expecting good one soon and on top of that you always have to worry it will be in French cause not even their twitter sticks to English.
rbuhil,hnqswmr,hnqswmr,2022 Vitality roster,nyanko_dango3,12/08/2021,1,solid  top 4 in NA
rbuhil,hnqtewh,hnqtewh,2022 Vitality roster,xWindSpeaker,12/08/2021,1,The biggest LEC roster ever seen we gathered the best EU players.  K.  E.  K.  W.  &#x200B  &#x200B   Labrov best EU support confirmed.  Selfmade best EU jungler confirmed.  Carzzy best EU ADC confirmed.   &#x200B  &#x200B  Most of G2 rosters were bigger and better than this. Even FNC had better teams than this back when Caps was there.   &#x200B  Getting Alphari and washed-up has-been who went to NA to win worlds and realized he isnt even good enough to be best NA midlaner doesnt make you Superteam. lol.
rbuhil,hnqshxk,hnqshxk,2022 Vitality roster,Coolestdude123,12/08/2021,1,Depends for me how good Perkz is as a midlaner. We dont really know for sure. He needs to be more consistent than at C9 but we could easily put that down to home-sickness.
rbuhil,hnqsrma,hnqsrma,2022 Vitality roster,Monsieur_Perdu,12/08/2021,1,Well if it goes mental boom we for sure know that Selfmade is to blame.
rbuhil,hnqtj7v,hnqtj7v,2022 Vitality roster,VikingCreed,12/08/2021,1,This roster is either going to blow the doors off of LEC or its going to go up in flames. Either way itll be in a blaze of glory and very entertaining to watch.
rbuhil,hnqtsao,hnqtsao,2022 Vitality roster,Zohan4K,12/08/2021,1,2019 G2 had a good laugh

rbuhil,hnqt57d,hnqt57d,2022 Vitality roster,je-s-ter,12/08/2021,1,Well see if theyll be joking after they hit a rough patch during the split. Offseason banter means nothing.
rbuhil,hnqtg08,hnqtg08,2022 Vitality roster,Jonoabbo,12/08/2021,1,Alliance won the regular split and were the first team to win an EU title not named Fnatic... They were a great roster.
rbuhil,hnqsrul,hnqsrul,2022 Vitality roster,popmycherryyosh,12/08/2021,1,Id argue that back in the day the Alliance super team was (again at the TIME not now obviously) even bigger.
rbuhil,hnqsz4a,hnqsz4a,2022 Vitality roster,Mrush94-Fitness,12/08/2021,1,Comparing role for role doesn’t always work out. Playing as a team is a much bigger intangible

rbuhil,hnqucgg,hnqucgg,2022 Vitality roster,Sjeg84,12/08/2021,1,Hope vit can mesh together her well. This is a fun lineup with international potential. Also I hope they can step up their PR game this was a super basic announcement.

rbuhil,hnqv67b,hnqv67b,2022 Vitality roster,ZXKeyr324XZ,12/08/2021,1,True about Razork though I think Hirit and Vetheo had better performances than Szygenda and Lider

rbuhil,hnqvxwd,hnqvxwd,2022 Vitality roster,thefalc0ns,12/08/2021,1,When the reason WHY Perkz is the western goat is his capability to lead a team and level up all of his teammates an absurd amount it means he still is by far the best midlaner even if skillwise he is even.

rbuhil,hnqvf7k,hnqvf7k,2022 Vitality roster,Darkfire293,12/08/2021,1,He did capitalize on it? That’s why he was the best toplaner in LEC 2020. If you put Perkz on Astralis do you think they can go to Worlds Finals and win MSI?
rbuh29,rbuh29,rbuh29,The changes to TP are actually beneficial for 2 reasons.,ChocoTeddini,12/08/2021,2,1. Solokilling earlygame the enemy toplaner is currently very often not worth it which is absurd.  For those that dont know why: the 0-1 toplaner respawns so fast and can TP to a minion creating a freeze against the 1-0 toplaner that killed him who is probably too low HP to stay and contest the freeze. This means the 1-0 toplaner has to TP back to not lose a huge amount of cs/xp and to make things worse hes now extremely vulnerable to a jungle gank and has no TP to recover from said gank if it happens.  With the new TP this horrible tactic is gone the enemy can only TP to his tower too late to freeze the wave.  2) Double TP is very common and makes playing for botlane 2v2s as an aggressive support  very risky which encourages passive play or roaming with the jungler to mid/top which results in even lower agency for the ADC.  With the new TP sololaners will have to gank bot manually and can TP to defend their tower after the gank is over. For those that complain about strategy loss imo pathing towards bot takes planing and pathing skill while pressing TP the second the enemy Thresh lands a hook just encourages Thresh to main Yuumi instead.  This change encourages toplane 1v1 earlygame botlane 2v2 autonomy and slightly less support roams. If toplane because substantially weaker as a result it can always get compensation buffs in other ways. What are other benefits of the new TP that others may point out?
rbuh29,hnqdpy3,hnqdpy3,The changes to TP are actually beneficial for 2 reasons.,Progenitor3,12/08/2021,1,I would say they should stop dumbing down the game.
rbuh29,hnqeunh,hnqeunh,The changes to TP are actually beneficial for 2 reasons.,Jandromon,12/08/2021,1,In decent elos insta TPing to a Thresh hook is not a huge display of skill its a threat that makes botlanes become passive. It takes more skill to win top then path bot from base with smart pathing gank bot with jungler and then TP top to defend after the gank. THAT takes skill not TPing bot the moment you see your botlanes HP bar go low on the HUD.
rbuh29,hnqk95m,hnqk95m,The changes to TP are actually beneficial for 2 reasons.,bz6,12/08/2021,1,How does it dumb down the game though?  It removes cross map opportunities unless you use the TP to defend a dive. But I am intrigued to hear how it dumbs down the game
rbuh29,hnqfb7p,hnqfb7p,The changes to TP are actually beneficial for 2 reasons.,Kingjso,12/08/2021,1,TP like that and you lose a crap ton of waves and plates and insta lose top. TPing whenever bot health bars are low is such a gross oversimplification of how good top laners use TP.
rbuh29,hnqhmhs,hnqhmhs,The changes to TP are actually beneficial for 2 reasons.,SkeletonJakk,12/08/2021,1,Reading all these people complaining about how you can just tp bot despite the fact if you do that and dont then get a double you come back to lane massively behind and even if you do get the kills youre likely behind in exp.
rbuh29,hnqgmow,hnqgmow,The changes to TP are actually beneficial for 2 reasons.,AndlenaRaines,12/08/2021,1,Yeah its embarrassing.
rbuh29,hnqowx9,hnqowx9,The changes to TP are actually beneficial for 2 reasons.,Rexsaur,12/08/2021,1,I just think it should have been for the entire game and not just 14 min.  TP is too powerful of a spell being able to basically tp basically anywhere you want (wards) has always been the too strong part of it it should be limited to towers always.
rbuh29,hnqq5wo,hnqq5wo,The changes to TP are actually beneficial for 2 reasons.,EmilianoR24,12/08/2021,1,Its just a nerf for toplane now getting a tp advantage early means a lot less and you cant influence the map tping botlane early in the lane was already bad unless your wave is in a good state
rbuh29,hnqqjtx,hnqqjtx,The changes to TP are actually beneficial for 2 reasons.,npri0r,12/08/2021,1,I love the tp change. It means I can finally roam on Asol without fearing the brand with tp will just to right into the fight and get a triple.
rbuh29,hnqqyj1,hnqqyj1,The changes to TP are actually beneficial for 2 reasons.,49blower,12/08/2021,1,Wouldn’t that make it completely useless on a losing map? If you had open nexus you’d literally have no second summoner spell.
rbuh29,hnqrdlo,hnqrdlo,The changes to TP are actually beneficial for 2 reasons.,WatDeFak,12/08/2021,1,Let tp being usable on destroyed turrets then I think it‘s fine if it cannot be casted on anything else. But also I think the long cast time could be reduced even further.
rbuh29,hnqrdb8,hnqrdb8,The changes to TP are actually beneficial for 2 reasons.,Rexsaur,12/08/2021,1,I think by the time you have an open nexus and literally no other structure alive you have bigger problems than a summoner spell being good or not you have pretty much already lost the game.

rbuh29,hnqvr23,hnqvr23,The changes to TP are actually beneficial for 2 reasons.,Alex_Wizard,12/08/2021,1,To be honest I think a LOT of people are overthinking this nerf. Do people TP gank in lower Elo’s before 14mins? Sure but it’s pretty rare.   This nerf will likely only significantly impact Diamond through Challenger as well as pro play. Watching my Silver-Gold friends play Clash a lot I doubt there are many games in SoloQ where silver players are constantly getting tp flanked where proper vision warding or looking at the map wouldn’t avoid.
rbuh29,hnquned,hnquned,The changes to TP are actually beneficial for 2 reasons.,TheScyphozoa,12/08/2021,1,It removes opportunities.
rbuh29,hnqvlar,hnqvlar,The changes to TP are actually beneficial for 2 reasons.,49blower,12/08/2021,1,Alright lets take a step back then. Lets say that you have lost all of your T1 and T2 turrets and are left with just inhib and nexus turrets.  In this situation realistically the only use for TP would be to stop a split push. But if theres no offensive TP anymore then split pushes should be extremely telegraphed and allow for recalling if timing is good. The only situation where it would only come down to it would be teleporting back urgently after finishing an objective.  And if the enemy team doesnt have a split pusher? You basically dont have much use for your second summoner spell.  Let it be clear I agree with the TP changes on PBE but your suggestion just seems a bit excessive imo.

rbu8mm,rbu8mm,rbu8mm,Maybe Overheal needs a rework?,SauloJr,12/08/2021,0,Its a rarely seen rune whose purpose is actually taken by Bloodthirster.  Ive been asking some people such as friends and streamers and everyone seems to agree that Overheal is NEVER worth it when compared to Triumph (considered the best by most) and PoM.  It provides no benefits during the laning phase as we almost never have the opportunity to overheal.   As a late game rune (I think it is not sure) it really doesnt feel rewarding to take. It scales with 10% of your maximum health and nothing else.  I thought that maybe just maybe Riot should try abandoning the Overheal idea and then make it work similar to Old Mordekaisers passive: You get a shield equal to X% of what you heal decaying slowly if you havent dealt or taken damage in the last 4 seconds.  Obviously the percentage would be very small early game but probably significant late so it can compete with Triumph in terms of combat and scaling.  I mean PBE is right there they could just throw this change there and see how it goes. If it doesnt work they would just revert it. Would this be a good idea tho? Not sure.
rbu8mm,hnqfscc,hnqfscc,Maybe Overheal needs a rework?,DenZiTY,12/08/2021,1,I agree as right now the only champ that actually takes overheal unironically is Aphelios who can make the most use out of it since he starts the game with the red gun (lifesteal).
rbu8mm,hnqehtk,hnqehtk,Maybe Overheal needs a rework?,YetAnotherBee,12/08/2021,1,getting free shielding constantly based off healing isnt a terrible idea I suppose but in terms of power level that would have to be a keystone not a secondary.

rbu8mm,hnqjd5r,hnqjd5r,Maybe Overheal needs a rework?,DenZiTY,12/08/2021,1,Not really I think youd want Triumph or PoM over Overheal since BTs passive will do the overheal for him anyway.  Aphelios takes it because he has innate lifesteal and passively farming with red will just give you a shield for free due to how potent red gun is in early game.
rbu8mm,hnqmh76,hnqmh76,Maybe Overheal needs a rework?,BobIsMyCableGuy,12/08/2021,1,yeah.
rbu8mm,hnqnvr8,hnqnvr8,Maybe Overheal needs a rework?,ASlothPotato,12/08/2021,1,It depends on the game imo. I agree that Triumph is better for graves in most senarios since his build path usually has LDR or collector as his second item (assuming you build shieldbow first). Even with BT it depends on the enemy teamcomp and if he can utilize that extra shield more effectively which is a no more often then not.

rbu2qs,hnq8jtd,hnq8jtd,Can Viktor be decently played as a support champ?,Resouledxx,12/08/2021,1,No. His CC is delayed and he scales hard with gold and levels. If it’s normals do your thing but in ranked you’re ruining the game for your teammates.

rbtof2,hnq6tdv,hnq6tdv,Stick playing against bots?,CallMeKillshot,12/08/2021,1,Tbh play normal games against people to have fun play ranked to stop having fun but improve more watch some video on controling lane minions on yt is a lot helpfull vs real players and is basic of the game.  One More tip if you are beginner all i can say what i changed to come from 4seson hardstuck silver to plat1/diamond 4 hardstuck now.  1. Stop looking when someone is bad on your team let them dont be toxic only ping if you see they are ganked or something no matter what you write wont matter to them look for you own mistakes instead of blaming other lane for theirs remeber all games that you have lost have only 1 thing incommom and that is you. 2. Select a(role) and group of champs you like to play that suits the role  (if you are mid jng idk what is your fav lane) i personaly prefer assasin and high mobility champs you do you 3.once you are good enough you will start losing friends rember that so you have to decide  what you want the upper the leader you go less fun it is but you want more is basicly addiction  4. Rather get flamed by other teamates and fix you mistakes instead of  blaming others for your own   Top tip really watch videos on  controling lane minions once you understand  this and use it in game you are already silver-gold player.   Gl   Edit if you are eune or euw i can give you some tips

rbtof2,hnq7o2d,hnq7o2d,Stick playing against bots?,YungStewart2000,12/08/2021,1,I would go bots > norms/aram > ranked if thats your end goal  Bots are only good when you literally just start out and have no idea what to do. Eventually though they will end up being bad for you because you will get so used to how easy they are and the mistakes they make that real people wont. Norms will be regular people but since its not ranked its a lot more chill. Some people still tilt for the sake of it but overall you dont have to worry about ruining someones rank. Just dont purposely ruin it (obviously).   Aram imo will help you learn more champs and how to synergize in team fights but it does lack every bit of macro you need on the Rift so it wont help you there. It is way more fun in general though.   Basically youll only ever improve playing against real people but at the end of the day its about what you have fun playing. There are plenty of people who literaally only play bots only play aram or only play the rotating fun modes because thats what they like.
rbtof2,hnq9gw5,hnq9gw5,Stick playing against bots?,TheUnk0wnDead,12/08/2021,1,Definitely with people it simply is a different experience.   If you keep playing with bots you might think that you are better than you actually are. You need to play against other players to better determine what actions are good and which are bad. Against bots you might develop a certain strategy which might work but chances are it wont work or at least not as good against real players.  You could play against bots for a while or whenever you feel unsure about something like when you want to play a new champ but dont know their kit that well but in the end you cant really compare the AI and its actions to real players.

rbtfq7,rbtfq7,rbtfq7,Mechanical Questions,SteeleStriker,12/08/2021,9,Hey all!  I am a new player to the MOBA genre and league of legends as a whole. I have lots of experience gaming and have been top 500 in games like rainbow six siege in the past.  I have been recently enjoying league of legends but have some questions and concerns about the gameplay.  Mechanics wise I am very use to aim being a crutch I can rely on and a hard mechanic i have mastered but it is not a feature of this game. While this game certainly takes skill I feel as if 1v1s in lane or in general are won by whomever positions their champion smarter in the lane and farms effectively/buys new items will wind out on top. Is there a level of mechanical skill in 1v1/teamfight engagements that i’m simply not seeing or is this games skill set purely strategical?
rbtfq7,hnq7j3g,hnq7j3g,Mechanical Questions,misteryon22,12/08/2021,1,Being able to mechanically execute your champions combos and spells is a factor that can make or break a fight but in general I would agree with you that strategy (when to go in who to go in on when to focus objectives over fights etc) is the more important part of league.
rbtfq7,hnq7ost,hnq7ost,Mechanical Questions,MAD_Iion,12/08/2021,1,One thing thats really important in 1v1 is knowing what your opponent can do. Keep in mind what their abilities are and how they might use them against you.
rbtfq7,hnq7qk4,hnq7qk4,Mechanical Questions,Regereggae,12/08/2021,1,Well while the game is more focused on decision making it certainly takes mechanical skill to control your champpion fluently. For example with good movement you can:  Autospace: meaning keeping certain distance from your enemy. Example would be being ranged against melee and then attacking enemy instead of running backwards which could for example lead to being killed  Dodging skillshots: faster click apm and reflexed will allow you to dodge more skillshots and react go several other things you have to react for. Good example would be fiora w vs volibear stun in which being or not being able to react is often deciding factor in fight. (gamesense anticipation and decision making play big part in this too)   Landing abilities: being able to predict what your enemy does and being able to drive them into position where they cannot dodge your abilities. (gamesense anticipation and decision making play big part in this too)  Fluent and natural control of your character: ability to react to situtations accordingly in heat of a moment with the tools provided. Better you are at this more clean accurate and faster your ability combos and such will be.  Cursor accuracy keyboard accuracy two hand+eye coordination all determine how good you are in different kind of situtations. Generally skillsets in Mobas and RTS games are lot wider than in most FPS games and there is unimaginable amount of different skills you can master.
rbtfq7,hnq7tb5,hnq7tb5,Mechanical Questions,SuperSucc69,12/08/2021,1,Good mechanics will get you far but you cant brute force everything in league with mechanics alone. Knowing what to do and when to do something is much more important. You can definitely get the edge in Teamfights with good mechanics but your and your teams positioning relative to the other team keeping track of cooldowns and other variables is a safer way to win. Making smart decisions like base timing and manipulating minion waves help you get an advantage without even killing your opponent. In the end league is a team game (although it may not feel like it in Soloq) and you cant win a game just by yourself most of the times.
rbtfq7,hnq7x08,hnq7x08,Mechanical Questions,Greedy-Speaker-7214,12/08/2021,1,It really depends on the champion. Champions like garen dont have much mechanical skill expression but on champs like lee sin you could spend hours practicing some mechanics and they would still be hard to pull off. So there is skill expression but on not all champs and league is indeed a more strategy focussed game.
rbtfq7,hnq8qb8,hnq8qb8,Mechanical Questions,HareKrishnoffski,12/08/2021,1,Just play Volibear his rework was made so handless people can play the game

rbtfq7,hnqc6ky,hnqc6ky,Mechanical Questions,SteeleStriker,12/08/2021,1,Thank you for your input! I have noticed doubting your decisions makes big differences because it screws with your timing and other things.
rbtfq7,hnqcbwr,hnqcbwr,Mechanical Questions,SteeleStriker,12/08/2021,1,100% agree even with the few hours I know for example if there is a Caitlin I am NOT safe behind my minions because she can attack straight through them. God I hate Caitlin.
rbtfq7,hnq83t4,hnq83t4,Mechanical Questions,Regereggae,12/08/2021,1,To add if you are interested what good mechanics may look like in league you could look up montages guides and gameplay from mechanical champions such as vayne draven kalista azir katarina zed riven leblanc akali qiyana lee sin nidalee thresh pyke fiora etc...
rbtfq7,hnqhpsh,hnqhpsh,Mechanical Questions,FedorSeaLevelStiopic,12/08/2021,1,As previous comment mentioned those factors are very important. But if you watch high elo players an mechanical champs there are champions that heavily rely on mechanics to reach their full potential. Most obvious example probably is riven. I kid you not playing against high level riven smurf in some plat-gold feels like playing vs cheater. You can watch riven mechanics on youtube if you want. To play her to full potential u need very good and consistant mechanics.
rbtfq7,hnqio3h,hnqio3h,Mechanical Questions,nEEEZdUTSS,12/08/2021,1,Mechanical skill is more evident on some champions while not much needed on others. As you gain more experience in the game you will start noticing which players are mechanically superior to others you cant tell yet because you dont know what you are looking exactly.         Game knowledge and strategy will only get you so far same for mechanics. You can be mechanically gifted or practice difficult champions but if you dont know how to play the strategic aspect of the game you will also not get far you need a solid amount of both.
rbtfq7,hnqgk8k,hnqgk8k,Mechanical Questions,Yoloboy696969,12/08/2021,1,every champ in the game can auto attack over/through minions

rbtfq7,hnqunre,hnqunre,Mechanical Questions,Alex_Wizard,12/08/2021,1,Mechanical skill is passively learned over time as you get more comfortable on each champion. It’s better to focus on fundamentals such as wave management object control managing waves during laning properly etc. to improve.   That said once you get comfortable with a champions kit it doesn’t hurt to look up guides on the finer points and combos to them to start practicing those.
rbtfq7,hnqv6tg,hnqv6tg,Mechanical Questions,CyborgTiger,12/08/2021,1,I think he prob means Cait Q. A lot of skill shots will be blocked by minions.

Are there any other champions this is happening to or did i just choose an unlucky champ?

rbsj2h,hnqdxkt,hnqdxkt,Who has gone the longest without a skin,VitaminD3K2,12/08/2021,1,Union Jack was my favourite Fiddle skin pre rework the British flag colors were so clear. I used to play Fiddle support with that skin and type in all chat do you lads want some tea and buttered crumpets? Here have some to enemy botlane before pressing E on them especially if I could get the multiple bounces when they were next to each other and had no minions nearby. And doing hooligan chat like oi oi saveloy. Had them bound to a macro key. Rework model ruined that skin because you can barely see the union jack anymore. Also the effigies kinda made Fiddle support alot harder. Dont play him anymore.
rbsj2h,hnpyr69,hnpyr69,Who has gone the longest without a skin,boogy0072,12/08/2021,-2,I feel they should get one soon because its rare to see a champ go a year without a skin now.

rbsj2h,hnqe8aa,hnqe8aa,Who has gone the longest without a skin,UX1Z,12/08/2021,1,Er yes it would. Do you have literally no imagination whatsoever? All they need to do is have the suit meld into him in a few places at the extremities in the splash art implying its formed from his own body. Then they can tweak it during animations as necessary.

rbsj2h,hnqfkk7,hnqfkk7,Who has gone the longest without a skin,DeathCap4Cutie,12/08/2021,1,Voli just got a skin and prestige like 2 months ago.  But I mean GP did get a new skin. Team skins don’t count for riots plans so it won’t like effect his other releases but he did get a skin (as in they won’t push back a skin cause of a team skin). So if you were a GP player there was a skin for you to buy unlike other champs like Fiddle who haven’t even had that.
rbsj2h,hnq8d05,hnq8d05,Who has gone the longest without a skin,CreativeAd481,12/08/2021,1,Riots data on their game and playerbases behaviors are stored in thousands of Google docs and nothing else

rbsj2h,hnqasoj,hnqasoj,Who has gone the longest without a skin,SNSDave,12/08/2021,1,https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/news/dev/ask-riot-another-lux-skin/  >We often prioritize skins for our most popular champions like Lux and Kai’Sa because they reach a huge number of players. Not only does this mean we can delight a lot of people at once but it also directly funds our ability to make skins for champs with small-but-dedicated playerbases. The often unspoken real talk is that… yes we are a business and we want to continue supporting League with new features and content through the years to come. Creating skins for popular champions allows us to do so in addition to helping to fund things beyond the game like the upcoming animated series Arcane.  No theyre pretty transparent that some champs get more skins because theyre popular and profitable. And Riot is a business.

rbseaq,rbseaq,rbseaq,Theory : What if Smurf queue wasn't made to relieve normal ranked players but increasing retention of Smurf ?,MrThematic,12/08/2021,0,Hear me out If you were challenger seasons ago with the level you had smurfing back to Challenger was easy it would be fast and clean youd have 2 challenger account in no time.   But at this point why play anymore? theres no challenge and challengers quit the game en-mass out of boredom.     However with the smurf queue system problem is solved!   Smurf are now detected analyzed ranked based on their performance and matched-up with all those data. Diamond-silver players will face Diamond-silver players so everyone is happy climbing is a challenge again for high-end players !     But damn us normal ranked 50% WR players having to deal with being filled in those matches and watching 2 players decide for the game. we are just fillers.

I never heard of challanger players being like I reached challanger everything is done. It seems to always be about reaching X LP or hitting Rank 1 (or any specific number). I actually barely see challanger players playing on smurfs that arent at least Grandmaster to be honest.   Maybe I just watch the wrong ones though.
rbseaq,hnq88kz,hnq88kz,Theory : What if Smurf queue wasn't made to relieve normal ranked players but increasing retention of Smurf ?,CohnDev,12/08/2021,1,It sounds like you think smurf queue means you rank up really fast so you dont ruin a lot of low-ranked games but thats not what smurf queue is at all. Smurf queue just means Riot flags your account and you will now play with other smurfs so you CANT rank up really fast. Like a smurf queue lobby looks like 10 plat players all playing in silver together.  The whole reason behind it is to deter people from smurfing because high elo queue times are so long not to increase the retention rate. Bad theory.
rbseaq,hnqe9v5,hnqe9v5,Theory : What if Smurf queue wasn't made to relieve normal ranked players but increasing retention of Smurf ?,Sea-Selection-399,12/08/2021,1,smurf queue is to disuade high ELO players from making new accounts instead of playing on their main due to insanely long queue times. Players smurf mostly because no one wants to wait 25mins for a game to pop. Riot is trying to fix those 25min timers by making it much harder to play on a lower ELO account and in turn has more high elo players queuing on their mains more often reducing the wait time for games in master+
rbseaq,hnpy1as,hnpy1as,Theory : What if Smurf queue wasn't made to relieve normal ranked players but increasing retention of Smurf ?,MrThematic,12/08/2021,0,>I never heard of challanger players being like I reached challanger everything is done  They probably would not be the kind to stream/be loud about quiting.  However that happened years ago when the  LoL is dead  trend began
rbseaq,hnpyzkf,hnpyzkf,Theory : What if Smurf queue wasn't made to relieve normal ranked players but increasing retention of Smurf ?,Pur1tas,12/08/2021,2,the Lol is dead trend has been around since season 2 lol. The only real time when I remember there was a lot of people stopping was when we had dynamic queue because it was just bad.   But generally speaking most challanger players I follow are playing challanger games on all their accounts basically the entire time. Surely an exception here and there in individuals who maybe have a duo account here and there but generally speaking I would argue most challanger players dont have smurfs that dont play challanger games.   OFC there will always be black sheep dont get me wrong but I think its so few in challanger that I doubt it matters. IMO smurf queue is mostly to get Diamond smurfs out of Silver games.
rbsdg0,rbsdg0,rbsdg0,3rd Party Application for lobby/player information,__v1ce,12/08/2021,2,Do you guys have any experience with Porofessor Blitz Mobalytics or Facecheck? I just want something that manually checks my lobbies like if you were to put everybodys name into opgg or something similar  So I can see what my teammates primary champions are their winrates their last 10 games their prefered lanes etc  I dont care about matchup tips or runes or anything like that i just want something purely for lobby info
rbsdg0,hnpxizh,hnpxizh,3rd Party Application for lobby/player information,Space_Kitty69,12/08/2021,1,I have porofessor. My friend has Mobalytics. I heard mob is better I think it also sets up your runes also. Poro tells you everything same with mob. It even tells you if there is a stack in the opp or your team.   It also tells you what you should lvl first in abilities and what kinda runes (poro). I think it’s useful. But if you have a toaster as a computer like I do then it’ll make you lack a bit.

rbsdg0,hnq7rtn,hnq7rtn,3rd Party Application for lobby/player information,__v1ce,12/08/2021,1,I mostly check it before i ban something to make sure I dont ban someones main  Or worst case scenario I dodge the game which is often more dependent on the enemy comp rather than my teammates stats
rbsdc5,rbsdc5,rbsdc5,Which champions do you think could use or need rework?,Balrok99,12/08/2021,5,Personally as someone who plays Viktor I think he needs something to live up to his GLORIOUS EVOLUTION.  Now I would not add or remove any abilities but I would do something about his ability upgrade.  Right now you can permanently upgrade one of your abilities. But what if you had 2 upgrade options for each ability?   There could be a small tab near the icons where when you click on it it shows 2 possible upgrades on which you spend your material from passive. And you would be also able to switch between those upgrades with cooldown of course. So you can improvise and adapt and overcome.  For example  **Death Ray** \- **1st** upgrade will make a follow up explosion. **2nd** possible upgrade is longer beam and slightly longer cast range BUT without the follow up explosion.  **Gravity Field** \- **1st** upgrade will make all your abilities to slow down enemies. **2nd** possible upgrade will make the gravity field larger.  **Siphon Power - 1st** upgrade will make you faster and gain shield when you hit the enemy. **2nd** upgrade will add silence for a brief moment.   **Chaos Storm - 1st** upgrade 25% moving faster **2nd** upgrade will make chaos storm a bit larger and will slow down enemies.  With this Viktor would be able to adapt to face his enemies. You could go for more CC with slow on ultimate and larger Field and silence on your Q but you would loose your shield and slow on damaging abilities and second death ray. But you can then combine it what suit your style.   But you would have cooldown between each upgrade switch. So you cant revert your upgrades every 2 seconds.  What champion do you think needs rework or just some adjustments?
rbsdc5,hnpxa5v,hnpxa5v,Which champions do you think could use or need rework?,YohGourt,12/08/2021,6,Well that sounds cool but maybe for another champion.  I think Aurelion Sol should get a rework or a rollback

rbsdc5,hnpz8y9,hnpz8y9,Which champions do you think could use or need rework?,criiaax,12/08/2021,4,I just hope for an Alistar E Rework.

Not because of their kits not working but because theyre genuinely unfair and poorly designed.   Quinn shyv skarner and janna all come to mind otherwise for VGUs specifically. I honestly think teemo could use a mini-rework to make him less of a mushroom bot.

rbsdc5,hnqqqb6,hnqqqb6,Which champions do you think could use or need rework?,EgonThyPickle,12/08/2021,1,Tryndamere Shyvana Nocturne Malphite and possibly KogMaw should receive full reworks. All of them have either really binary or stat-checky kits imo.  Neeko Skarner and Zyra could probably use some adjustments but I think their kits are overall pretty fine.
rbsdc5,hnqrqn3,hnqrqn3,Which champions do you think could use or need rework?,BlackKaiserDrake,12/08/2021,1,Rework Kayle. Youre basically a caster minion for about 20 minutes and then become the literal embodiment of Ranged Tryndamere.   &#x200B  Outside of her rework Swain a bit. My idea would be make his passive similar to Thresh but he gains HP and Mana per stack instead of AP and Armor. Could also make his E detonate instantly when it touches a champion even when going out so its a bit easier to escape from the 10/0/3 Garen running you down. W and Q are fine IMO maybe reduce Qs mana cost because holy hell it is draining even late game. Not sure how the Ult could be changed.
rbsdc5,hnqsego,hnqsego,Which champions do you think could use or need rework?,TheTaffyMan,12/08/2021,1,I do think Viktor having branching evolutions/adaptiveness would be very cool and add skill expression  Shyvana/Nocturne/Quinn/Teemo all miss the mark on their champ fantas  Tryndamere has a very toxic design and needs to be modernized  Skarner/Malphite are like minions with how basic their kits are. Nothing notable besides their ultimates.

I’m not going to ask about all those voices complaining that he is still playing in LEC but about what he brings into the game. In the recent video posted by Astralis there was a statement that he is really vocal in the game. Did you also see while playing with him that he is the main shotcaller?   > Yeah I can only agree on that statement. When nobody is saying anything he’s always trying to shotcall or at least say something so it isn’t quiet anymore. He’s good in-game leader from what I’ve seen he’s always trying to make plays sometimes it looks like an int but you learn from it so you rather int than doing nothing. You can see that in his playstyle and I really enjoy that because I like that playstyle as well. He’s a great shotcaller for sure.

rbs3p2,rbs3p2,rbs3p2,"Possible plothole in Arcane, pls someone explain",MrTortaFrita,12/08/2021,0,Dont get me wrong I LOVE Arcane. Watched it like 3 times at least. Loved the characters the plot the animation and the music. But theres one thing that bugging me and cant let me sleep. I apologize if this was asked before Im new to this subreddit.  My question is how is Silco unaware that Vi was in the Stillwater Prison for so many years? I mean hes the boss of the underworld and for sure needs to know of the notorious inmates that are locked up in the nearest prison to him. Also it is implied that Vi was a problematic inmate getting into fights with other prisoners and the guards too. Really not a single of Silcos goon recongnized Vanders pink haired daughter being there?  Also not like shes trying to hide her identity to protect herself she tattooed her name on her face. (maybe she didnt know she was in danger or something)  Again its not hate I just want someone to give me a logic explanation for this in case I missed anything.  Thanks and I cant wait for season 2 :)  EDIT: I know Marcus assured Silco that Vis dead but people from the underworld would end up in prison and for sure talk about the fact that Vanders supposedly dead daughter is in prison and word should spread around
rbs3p2,hnpvm27,hnpvm27,"Possible plothole in Arcane, pls someone explain",Pur1tas,12/08/2021,6,From how I understand it Silco didnt know many of the police himself and just used his goon officer to take care of that. And that guy knew if I am not mistaken. He just didnt report it to Silco because reasons?   So yeah so while Silco surely controlls the police to a degree its not like they know he controlls them and they dont like know each other personally. And the communication line to Silco didnt tell him shes alive.  EDIT: just saw your Edit and I don’t think many people would have seen vi. Sounded like the police force kept her rather isolated
rbs3p2,hnpx3pt,hnpx3pt,"Possible plothole in Arcane, pls someone explain",Immediate_Energy_711,12/08/2021,3,I dont think he really cared about the prison. And money is on Vi not really being a known variable in the prison till she beat the frell out of that one guy.
rbs3p2,hnpvf14,hnpvf14,"Possible plothole in Arcane, pls someone explain",AureaMediocritas1,12/08/2021,5,Because the cop took it as a secret??? He said he killed her but she was secretly in the prison.  Where is the plothole?
rbs3p2,hnpy841,hnpy841,"Possible plothole in Arcane, pls someone explain",vooffle,12/08/2021,1,I think Silco was only concerned with Vi being out of the way. As for information coming out of Stillwater the place didnt seem like it takes visitors. There likely isnt much information moving between Stillwater and the outside world and thus most inmates in Stillwater wouldnt know what interest Vanders daughter is of to Silco.
rbs3p2,hnpzvrd,hnpzvrd,"Possible plothole in Arcane, pls someone explain",SilenceOfRage,12/08/2021,1,Marcus assured him that she died in the fire Silco thoughts she died along with Vander when the building burned.  Silco had NO access to the piltovian prison it is a high security place who is ruthless toward their prisonners. If you wonder why Silco a criminal dont have ties with a prison it is because you need to think Silco HATE piltover supremacy and for him this place isnt something he wish to control but if anything he would break it since they hold his own people.  He has no ties to it and this place has no interest with him it is its own dynamic hell so the guard/hierarchy has no interest meddling with him when they rather just have him inside. See it like that they dont need money and see the people of the undercity like criminal rats they dont need silco and dont value him. Marcus is tied to Silco because Silco can blackmail him for being responsible of his captain death and then can threaten his daughter sure Marcus gained some stuff but it wasnt what he wanted.  Marcus saved Vi by sending her to the only place where no one could go just like that a place where people generally stay a long time a place where only him and some people have information. He protected his own ass but also protected her it is why he is an interesting character. He is selfish but not heartless he do wrong things but also do things that are right/dont give him direct benefit.  Also you talk about Vis identity being known but outside of powder silco & some goons who knew vi before? Ekko? She was the adoptive daughter of vander but it isnt like she was that much of a celebrity and as time passed people forget and just thought she died (as Ekko did). When she was young Vi certainly couldnt do that much damage in prison especially when Silco goons would not get arrested that much since he was established as much in zaun.  Then as years came by Vi became stronger Silcos influence made him have more goons that got arrested more and therefore send to the prison for years where they had the wonderful surprise to encounter an angry Vi.
rbs3p2,hnq69xf,hnq69xf,"Possible plothole in Arcane, pls someone explain",misteryon22,12/08/2021,1,From what we can gather the prison isnt a place where much info gets out through inmates since it looks like they dont get released much.  Aside from that Id assume the most he would hear is of a troublesome pink haired girl but seeing as pink hair doesnt seem rare (e.g. >!the firelight girl jinx killed!<) and I doubt anyone at the prison would bother remembering her name since they treat the prisoners like less than garbage.
rbs3p2,hnpvxwk,hnpvxwk,"Possible plothole in Arcane, pls someone explain",ApplePitou,12/08/2021,-1,Because Marcus assured him that Vi was gone and I suspect Silco didnt care too much because he had more important things on his mind :3

Didnt he say to marcus in the childs room something like your dad assured me that she is on a long trip or something like that.
rbs3p2,hnq9b9v,hnq9b9v,"Possible plothole in Arcane, pls someone explain",JuanBARco,12/08/2021,1,Also general underworld goons outside of those very close to silco wouldnt know who she was...   The group silco has close him arent the same as the people Vander associated with outside of Sevika (who was his #2 and likely never was in prison).   I dont think Vi was as well known as the viewer thinks she was before getting out of prison. She was a kid who never dealt in the underworld out side of what happens in the first 3 episodes.

rbs28l,rbs28l,rbs28l,Why is it so genuinely difficult to find good teammates,blaccswannie,12/08/2021,0,I know low elos are full of players that do not know how to properly carry a game or simply play it but if it is pretty more easy as a team why do people spend the time typing and flaming even trolling?  I dont know Im just tired of having the same games every day I play no matter how good I think Im playing it results on a exhausting game.  Sorry it might sound so stupid but not even the mute all works at this point XD
rbs28l,hnpvt4t,hnpvt4t,Why is it so genuinely difficult to find good teammates,Pur1tas,12/08/2021,5,Because good gets more and more relative and subjective the lower you go. You might find something someone else does good when its objectively not. This is due to a lack of knowledge and even a lack of knowledge about said lack of knowledge to a degree. This creates this feeling of always playing with idiots.   Ofc the flaming is just people having the self control of a toddler but thats a different topic I would argue.
rbs28l,hnpvdej,hnpvdej,Why is it so genuinely difficult to find good teammates,Natural-Ganache4565,12/08/2021,2,People like attention and its easier to get by trolling than being actually good.  Society is the same people being famous for being famous is easier than being at the top of a discipline
rbs28l,hnq8q1j,hnq8q1j,Why is it so genuinely difficult to find good teammates,CohnDev,12/08/2021,1,Because you dont know what a good teammate is. A good teammate is someone who plays to win from any position and ffs when the game is over not one who just carries bad players. If you want that higher someone to duo boost you.  Think about it like this if you think youre good your team has 4 people that could be bad and the enemy team has 5 people that could be bad. That means that on average you should be winning if you have a large sample size of games. If youve played a lot of games and thats not true then youre bad. Its just math.
rbs28l,hnpwrbw,hnpwrbw,Why is it so genuinely difficult to find good teammates,ApplePitou,12/08/2021,0,Its hard to say anything here because if we dont play with friends we are at the mercy of matchmaking and it happens very often that your team is not satisfactory but even the worst team will be able to find a common language and at least try to win :3
rbs138,rbs138,rbs138,We should get a HARD MMMR RESET with each new season.,MrThematic,12/08/2021,0,I know its not profitable for Riot since we wouldnt have to create multiple accounts to deal with years of uncompetitively played games.   I know some people will  go dark edgy mad mode and cry on Reddit to defend their virtual untied-to-actual-rank rank.I know.   I will still be a laminated Bronze player.  &#x200B  However with all the reward nerfs the clunky 50% WR matchmaking where I end up Bronze V team vs Silver I players every other games it would feel good to have an actual consumer friendly move from Riots part.  And by the way in my opinion soft reset doesnt exist. reseting a visual rank means nothing except giving a temporary illusion of progress every season because if you have 1000 games on your Bronze account you will still be Bronze after 100 games (thats around 42hours of game time ) even if you watch self improvement videos.
rbs138,hnpv8tn,hnpv8tn,We should get a HARD MMMR RESET with each new season.,Pur1tas,12/08/2021,5,So you think it would be better if you face challanger players at the start of every season clapping you to the moon? I mean if you really are bronze its wont even just be challanger players you face (and lose to) and it will take ages until you get matches that are actually competitive.  If anything keeping MMR across seasons improves matchmaking as MMR gets more accurate the more data you have. Resetting it seems like a deadset way to make everyone have horrible games for ... probably the entire season.
rbs138,hnpvbst,hnpvbst,We should get a HARD MMMR RESET with each new season.,HalexUwU,12/08/2021,1,Nope this is an absolutely awful idea!  The start of every season would just be Challenger players shiting on silvers and golds for a few months.

rbs138,hnpwijk,hnpwijk,We should get a HARD MMMR RESET with each new season.,Pur1tas,12/08/2021,1,But you complained about game quality. Do you really think the 50/50 you have now would stay that way with challangers around you? Do you understand how a ladder and thus MMR works?   Because you are worse than these people worse than most people (no flame). Meaning you wouldnt be 50/50. You would be like 10/90.   When everybody starts at the same spot every season this means people need to spread from there and they wont suddenly get worse just because of a reset. Meaning there are still Hundreds of thousands of people better than you but ranked and mmr wise at the same spot. They will go from there and go back to spreading the ladder as it was which means you would be losing A FUCKTON more.   Like... you are at 50/50 because you are about where you belong not because of anything else. You NOT being where you belong would just lead to you losing more.   Also are you implying that there are challanger smurfs in your bronze games?

rbs138,hnpxs6s,hnpxs6s,We should get a HARD MMMR RESET with each new season.,MrThematic,12/08/2021,0,Lets be honest for 2 seconds here every single games are decided by the 2 best players in each teams.   Im not saying Im the best or the worse Its just that nowadaysI have 50% of my games where I feel OP and everyone plays like a bot and the other 50% is like watching 4 LCS players fighting each others 2v2 while the rest plays play-doh.   Having challengers facing each others at those elo wouldnt change a thing to me Ill still be a spectator in every single games.   But its frustrating to see they are showed as Bronze when they clearly are not.
rbs138,hnpyj40,hnpyj40,We should get a HARD MMMR RESET with each new season.,Pur1tas,12/08/2021,2,I think you have a very broken view of the game. You are bronze (right?) so OBVIOUSLY games are super one sided. Everybody is really bad at the game. Like really bad. Meaning just one good play or one good game makes a DRASTIC difference.   This is not because you face better players its just because people play different from game to game and more so the lower you go in rank/elo/mmr.   When you feel op is your good game or their bad games or a combination.  If you werent a bronze level player you would climb out of there. But having challanger players in your games will do VERY different things and it wont be about which 4 players are the best. It will be about who abuses the worst players the most / who is the worst.   I promise you 100% that resetting MMR will only lead to worse matchmaking. As your games wont be decided by anyone else but you by that moment in time. Because YOU will be the biggest weakness more often than not (as you are an below average player again no flame) meaning you will lose more often probably be flamed for being bad too.   And its also not only about you. Do you really think someone who contested for rank 1 last season wants to spend his time clapping 99% of the ladder in unfun 1 sided stomps? I dont think so. It would just make it worse for everyone.
rbruy0,rbruy0,rbruy0,Chem tech rift needs adjustments,HalexUwU,12/08/2021,1,Im neither a qiyana or rengar player however I understand just how damning chem rift can be to your overall playstyle.   The removal of many major bushes makes these champions and some others Im sure suffer mid game. Without access to invisibility for qiyana or passive for rengar these champions basically lose any mid game they once had while playing within the jungle. These rifts need to provide a way for qiyana to get green passive and for rengar to get his resource reset/jump.
rbruy0,hnpuuek,hnpuuek,Chem tech rift needs adjustments,ApplePitou,12/08/2021,2,This is problematic for these champions but it depends a lot of luck because Chemtech Rift weakens them but Ocean Rift it helps them a lot :3

rbrrxr,rbrrxr,rbrrxr,"Circlejerk Instalment Nº3: The real issue with ADCs is not their stats, is their lack of AGENCY, aka outputs for their creativity.",Jandromon,12/08/2021,72,This post is about the key word in league that actually matters more than anything else: **AGENCY**.  Every other role but bot carry (ADC here for simplicity) has moderate to high amounts of **agency which I define as opportunities to be really creative and let your intelligence and decision-making shine**. Junglers roaming midlaners (90% of midlaners) and support are roles completely overflowing with agency.  But the kits of ADCs just dont allow for good decision-making and creativity to shine through. Theres some slight exceptions like Ashe R and Tristana jump but other than that **ADC is an uncreative role**. A good ADC is literally a robot that plays like a KDA whore farms up and if the game gets to minute 30 dominates front-to-back teamfights with undodgeable ranged damage which feels crappy for the enemy team. But if the game is lost before that its crappy for the ADC who didnt get to play.  The role is all about consistency and discipline. There is little room for creativity and no agency. This is an issue for people that could be smart about the game they might see lots of opportunities but they cant execute on them if theyre trapped inside an ADC.  But can we give ADCs more agency without giving them engage/CC/roaming tools? Yes the answer is in the past.  Story time: Back in the day before season 6-7 supports were weak ward bots and except for hook supports botlane was dominated by two ADCs dueling eachother. This provided a type of agency similar to toplane out-dueling the enemy to gain advantages earlygame. However this meant that support was a shitty role played by no one which affected queue times and lead to constant tilted offroles. So Riot then started buffing supports nerfing ADC resistances and crippling duo XP to the point of today where most supports can assassinate the ADC and are basically second junglers that dont need farm dont need XP after lv6 and can impact the whole map.  **How can we give ADCs their only chance at having agency –more power in lane– without turning support into a shitty role again?** How can we buff one without throwing the other under the bus?  Well I actually dont know. Thats why I made this post.

Compared to a lot of the newer marksmen like Kaisa/jhin and even Samira champions that are given agency through utility/survivability or even in the case of samira early team fighting power. All of this is also something riot themselves have pointed out that point and click ranged dps is very limited in how creative you are able to be with it compared to other classes of champions.

The archetype of aa damage reliant ranged champiom is far too strong to chuck agency on top of it. Thats why some of the adcs with the most agency either have less scaling/damage or are skillshot/casting based. If adc players want more agency then they must sacrifice their carrying level or their scaling. If adcs want more agency in their gameplay then i suggest they play other roles with more agency. You cant have both. I think a bigger problem is other lanes basically dominating how bot lane phase goes. This is why the tp change is good in my opinion

Games are about interactions off decisions. The game will escalate off identifying an opponents and equally minimising their own mistakes. For two players to be guaranteed a role that a community will lambast for making proactive decisions because their own team will not be prosctive is bafflng.   It is not reasonable when the reward is still the  idea a stiff breeze can Kill you late game.

So a keystone rework introduce more good defense options and suddenly if adc dont die against tank they will start being mattered.

rbrrxr,hnpvqzd,hnpvqzd,"Circlejerk Instalment Nº3: The real issue with ADCs is not their stats, is their lack of AGENCY, aka outputs for their creativity.",Rexsaur,12/08/2021,13,Actually stats are a problem too since adcs never got their base stats back from the 8.11 massacre.  And also they are the only squishy class that has to build full glass cannon to do damage nowdays a mage can have one of the strongest damage 2 item power spikes by building 2 items that have health on them (crown + shadowflame = 450 bonus hp + crown passive) this all on a role that usually play at a much higher range than adc usually does.  Mind you im fine with mages actually being able to play the game in this high damage environment but adcs also need to be able to just like them.  Adcs need the mage treatment they need to actually have some health thrown into their items so they can attempt to play the game without instantly being deleted by everything that moves in the game they already paid the damage for this in last season when they triple nerfed crit by nerfing AD crit chance AND crit damage on every crit item now its time for them to get something back.  Its either that or adc should be the hardest hitting class in the game to make up for the ease to kill like if they are going to play at lower range and are going to be so easy to kill by everything why isnt crit dealing 250% damage with IE again? So theres an actual huge reward to the huge risk the role has.  This is the main problem with adc the role has no direction its too squishy and doesnt do enough damage for its squishyness for its current damage atleast half of the crit items should already have +200 or 300 hp on them (specially dogshit items that are even under 100% cost efficiency like the zeal items mercurial IE etc).

The ADCs job is to survive and deal as much damage as possible.   By nature the role has less agency and thats fine imo. I say this as an ADC main.

In the gank you contribute the least. You also need your mid to have enough priority to avoid a disastrous collapse from their midlaner. Then when all of these conditions are done your role in this: walk up and autoattack the dragon a few times.  **Want to farm?** Hope your support has heavily warded a sidelane so its safe enough to farm and also you have to hope your more mobile more safe solo laners dont fight you for the wave because they will win. You cant provide presence by taking up a lane because you are a threat to nobody compared to a solo laner clearing waves in a sidelane to threaten a collapse if the enemy team thinks about approaching objectives.  **Want to provide some team utility?** ADCs cannot ward or deward because theyre too flimsy if they get attacked. Hence blue trinket which is taken mostly by ADCs and is mediocre as a visiontool. Most other classes take Oracles because they can reasonably walk within Oracle distance without dying and losing the game. In the case that you pick a utility ADC youre basically trolling because every time utility ADCs are playable theyre nerfed into meme tier for being abused by pros.  **Want to contest objectives?** Because youre so unbelievably easy to kill you cannot lead the charge to any objective fight. Say if you think the enemy team is going for dragon you cannot do anything to try and stop them until you have another teammate to walk in front of you. Of course League has terrible communication so its possible youll back them up only for them to hard dive leaving you alone where you get 100-0d by an Alistar with no damage items. So if you dont have backup? You cant contest anything. Meanwhile most solo laners with their presence alone can heavily discourage objective attempts nearby and do so just by themselves.  **Want to build defensively?** In ages past lifesteal was the de facto ADC defensive stat but now thornmail is the most common armor item for bruisers and tanks so your big lifesteal is even worse than raw defensive stats than it already was. Mages should they want to build defensively have several options including far-and-away the best item in the entire game Zhonyas Hourglass which they can comfortably build without heavily sacrificing their power. Other classes including supports have many defensive options for different situations. Since Lifesteal is extraordinarily unreliable as a defensive stat now ADCs really only have one defensive option: Shieldbow. Since the crit rework Guardian Angel not having crit makes it godawful for ADCs to build and the effect is so terrible for someone like an ADC its actually impressive. Attempting to build defensively beyond Shieldbow for ADCs is equivalent to trolling because your damage is so desperately tied to throughput items. Youll still be pretty squishy and youll do 0 damage so you just dont bother.

Wich makes the agency of an ADC lower and lower.  If you take an extreme exemple like Zed the dude can literally engage you from a screen away ... Wich makes it hard to pressure as adc since your safe distance is now an entire screen.  I think the overflowing amount of mobility within LoL right now is whats the biggest agency killer to ADC. Back in my days (yes im a grumpy LoL boomer) teams actually had to coordinate to target the adc nowadays assassins or even most bruiser/fighter/whatever can just do his thing solo without any kind of team coordination and still come with a kill on adc.  Its been quite a bit of time now that i think Sustain and Mobility are way too high in LoL. It makes it really hard to punish mistakes and easier to cover for your own mistakes. And also makes ADCs life harder.  P.S : Im support & ADC main since season 1

Fix the exp that is shared between two champs so that bot lane can stay in levels but also make supports roam less by making towers deal more damage to minions and stuff like that. If an adc can stay in levels then they have more HP and armor. With more hp and armor they die less.  Fix mid lane in the same way tower should deal more damage to minions and plates should also take more damage.  This dumb meta where supports and mid laners roam just as much as a jungler is damn stupid. Cut some of their power and it will help bot lane too.

Back at it with your favorite buzzwords and great intentions.  Let me remind you that the wildly popular opinion in this subreddit is that ADCs were overpowered all of last season because they have the best items. Never mind that the issues that the class suffers from can be found described in preseason posts dated 2020. All of a sudden ADCs are not just not overpowered but relatively weak. Huh. Those preseason 2022 changes must have really shaken up things for ADs!  You guys suck balls at this.  Do carry on though.

You talk about adc as if the only carries that exist are the hypercarry for lategame (since you specifically talk about farming for 30 minutes and then do the thing) when there are plenty of marksmen that do give you agency in lane and in the midgame.    If i pick darius cause i like darius i dont complain about the fact that after laning phase is over hes useless and has no agency in the game cause i know thats who he is a lane bully champ.   Complaining that marksmen have no agency in lane cause you decided to pick a hypercarry is not the way to go.

People probably wont agree with them all but these are some ways of doing it. Id probably pick 1 since all 3 together would be busted.  1. Nerf roaming across the board. Buff minion gold increase tower damage and attack speed. (Will weaken 4 man bot dives and kill minions faster so roaming is more punishing and not so ridiculously rewarding.)  2. Give adcs lane supremacy over supports. Buff ADC base stats Nerf support base stats. Especially the disgusting tanks that can 100-0 adcs with ignite. Supports should get better scaling in return so they arent useless ward bots later. Let them provide the utility in lane but the damage should be dished out by the actual carries.  3. Everyones favorite FIX CRIT! Crit adcs should spike on two items like on hit adcs do. That way they will at least hold agency over team fights if they cant have it anywhere else. IE is horribly designed in SR but itss TFT passive is actually really neat. Like in TFT crit items should just give you a ton of crit up front and the damage can start low and scale up as you overcap it. It would be way more linear less RNG based can be balanced easier and the entire class builds wouldnt have to orbit around IE.

Each role in Dota is impactful but has a defined way of being impactful which gives it agency. Not to mention the game is just SO much more balanced in every aspect. I played league for 7 years and I’m telling you it is no longer a MOBA. It is now a multiplayer anime action arcade battle arena. No more strategy at all.
rbrrxr,hnqg0do,hnqg0do,"Circlejerk Instalment Nº3: The real issue with ADCs is not their stats, is their lack of AGENCY, aka outputs for their creativity.",Pyranalol,12/08/2021,1,here is a list of things i find to be problematic:      **1) EXP**   Currently solo xp is at 90%\~ and duo exp at 120%\~ (60%\~each)   I wish that the support item had like mini-ziliean passive built in where the support player redirects 10% of his exp share to the lowest level nearby ally. So 50%exp for supp and 70% for adc. This would mean that arround lvl 6 supports should have slightly less impact in lane.      **2) Support Gold gain**   I would like to see early game support gold gain reduced and instead strech out the total gold gained over a longer period of time. I dont think its very balanced that ap supports with 6 cs can buy their ludens echo at the same time an adc completes his mythic at 120 cs AND get another 1k or so off of free stats from their support item quest.     **3) Support items and invisible damage**  When I heared they were making a new tank mythic for supports for this season I was exited. I was imagining an item that took damage out of the game to fight against the damage creep. I know that in any game power creep is kinda inevitble - but power creep does not have to be *damage* creep. Imperial mandate Evenshroud etc. all these items just add inisible damage to a team - small chip damage that isnt communicated well visually but adds up to thousands and thousands of damage over the course of a single game.     Support items could be so much more. They could be interacitve and reward certain playstyles. Why cant a tank support item proide damage reduction? Why does it always have to be damage? I get it dealing damage is fun - but you dont even feel the evenshroud damage and I think it is miles away from feeling as satisfying as using Galeforece or getting a kill with Collector.      Support is really strong right now and has really high agency and impact on the game. Yet support is the least played role because for a lot of players the role is boring or not very fulfilling due to the lack of items that promote interactive gameplay.

Even when its good you need to play borderline perfectly position-wise to not get insta-deleted or have a team that is capable of peeling you. That takes a lot of individual agency away from the ADCs at lower ELOS and makes the game incredibly unfun for them. I also had several friends quit because of this.        In high ELO its better because there they position better and their teammates more often somewhat know that they are doing. Its not bad in absolute terms but rly unfun. I liked playing ADC in like S5/6 but now I wouldnt touch them with a 3m pole (unless to kill them hence my flair lol)        In general the game became much more unfun over time with the damage creep IMO especially for premade with friends. Yes you have higher individual agency but the enemy also has higher individual agency. That means earlier if one of your mates feeded you could probably compensate them. Now the enemy will have that 12/3 Yone that you will have no chance of ever getting through. Makes playing with worse friends just feeling bad.

Marksmen felt alright in season 8. It‘s been 4 years since then. They slashed all kinds of base stats and then slashed duo lane minion and kill xp and buffed sololane xp in the same patch.  It wouldn‘t be as ridiculous as it is when you could actually regen some health in lane or wouldn‘t get chunked so hard by supports. That all started when they decided to cripple marksmen base stats across the board.  And the typical assassin/bruiser facerolls wouldn‘t mean automatic death either if marksmen weren‘t 3 (up to 5) levels down by default for having picked the wrong lane.  Obviously you have to nerf supports if you care about balance or maybe add to the supp item something like x% less experience gained or you just roll with it and supp becomes the strongest roll since it still seems to be the most unpopular role anyway and that might help its popularity.

rbrrxr,hnqgzxf,hnqgzxf,"Circlejerk Instalment Nº3: The real issue with ADCs is not their stats, is their lack of AGENCY, aka outputs for their creativity.",Pretend_Yam6590,12/08/2021,1,GM adc here:   To start off I personally enjoy the fact that adc is all about discipline consistency and efficiency. Thats what sets it apart from all the other roles. I really work hard to make myself unkillable not because I am extremely fed and can kill everything on sight but because of my positioning and mechanics. Being creative would be something interesting but being creative means that there is room for error. That room isnt there for adc. Like ezreal has that room because he has 2 flashes essentially and one of them can buffer certain cc completely. But on champs like jhin jinx etc. you have to be perfect in your movement and your decision making.    **Sometimes creativity isnt the goal perfection is.**   Moreover the reason adc is like this is because the way that adcs do damage is inherently unskilled and it has 0 counterplay. The primary way of dealing damage for adcs is right clicking on someone which is quite unskilled. Doesnt make the role unskilled but makes their attack mechanism easy. Moreover there is no counterplay to auto attacks. You have the ability to dodge skill shots you have the ability to zhonyas certain major abilities or skill shots you have the ability to flash out of certain spells. You cant do that with auto attacks. So if an ashe decides to start hitting you you either get out of her range or you buy enough time for her to die.   And that second part is the difficult part of adc. Unlike most champs that have bursts of damage where they move into the fight to use their spells and then pull out while they are on cd adcs spells (their auto attacks) are always available. They do more damage over time but they require you to be in danger for longer.   So what is the fix:    This problem is inherent with all auto attackers and essentially stat-checkers. Think of tryndamere. Either he is strong enough to one shot your back line and deal a ton of damage and win the fight on his own or he is completely useless. Thats the problem all stat-checkers face. And while tryndamere is a unique champion adcs have that same issue. If you make them too strong it warps the game completely around them. The reason adc isnt how it used to be before is because people have gotten better. If you brought back the game from early seasons adc would be the strongest role. I started playing in preseason of s9 but I remember doublelift saying that early adcs could get hit by skill shots and still be completely fine. Imagine that happening now. Good adc players would completely 1v9 every single game.   The problem is inherent with adcs. They tried to fix it with certain items that brought more skill expression like gale force but that item isnt really that good unless on specific champs.   But the problem is on bot laners too. Bot laners including myself refuse to play mages even when they have been shown to be strong or are strong in certain matchups. Bot lane is the only role in the game to have only 1 class in it. Supports have enchanters or engage tops and junglers have carries or tank/ganking junglers. ADC just has adc champs + ziggs and seraphine when it was meta. ADC players refuse to play any other champs.   Why? because adc requires a specific skill set that no other role requires including marksmen in other lanes. The amount of immediate foresight (predicting what your opponents will do in 1 or 2 seconds) and raw mechanics that adcs require makes the role very specific. This doesnt apply at all at lower elos but at higher elos this is very prevalent. This also goes both ways: adc players arent good at things that other players are good at. For example perkz in 2019 was an amazing adc because he brought things that other adc players lacked (skills and picks). He also was lucky to have xayah and kaisa in the meta two champs with repositioning/self peel. But in 2020 when the meta was back to standard adcs he had a really hard time adjusting to it. Caps did as well where he would run it down on a lot. Thats kind of what I mean with the skill set.   So there isnt any real fix but the problem is both with riot games and with the community.

I love how you didnt mention top lane in your argument.   >But the kits of ADCs just dont allow for good decision-making and creativity to shine through. Theres some slight exceptions like Ashe R and Tristana jump but other than that ADC is an uncreative role. A good ADC is literally a robot that plays like a KDA whore farms up and if the game gets to minute 30 dominates front-to-back teamfights with undodgeable ranged damage which feels crappy for the enemy team. But if the game is lost before that its crappy for the ADC who didnt get to play.  Same thing with enchanter supports? Also isnt that the point? That you feel good when youre strong and feel crappy when youre weak? If my team is losing as a support I cant do shit. I engage and die or Im stuck having to peel for a losing team.  >Story time: Back in the day before season 6-7 supports were weak ward bots and except for hook supports botlane was dominated by two ADCs dueling eachother. This provided a type of agency similar to toplane out-dueling the enemy to gain advantages earlygame. However this meant that support was a shitty role played by no one which affected queue times and lead to constant tilted offroles. So Riot then started buffing supports nerfing ADC resistances and crippling duo XP to the point of today where most supports can assassinate the ADC and are basically second junglers that dont need farm dont need XP after lv6 and can impact the whole map.  If support is as OP and easy to play as you say it is then [why is it still the least popular role](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/main-stats/master) even in Masters? By the way support being the least popular role is still a constant throughout all elos.

Its fun to have an impact on the game.  ADCs are parasitic when it comes to agency. The reason is simple their role is built on others sacrificing agency for them. Supports as a role was built around helping an ADC through lane getting them early kills and providing vision for the ADC while starving themselves of gold and xp. Thats the point of the duo lane: To give the ADC an easier time for them to carry late and win the game. To give the ADC impact while depriving the support of it.  Thing is that just wasnt fun for a majority of players. It wasnt fun to be a supporting character who hoped their ADC was good enough to make being their assistant matter. Thats why support was and is the least played role and why 5th pick support was almost accepted as the default before role queues. No one wanted to be the least impactful player. Especially if their ADC who had been given all the agency the support could provide mis-positions gets caught by the enemy Leona and loses the game for the team. Stuff like that makes players think I should have been like that Leona. I should have been the one to win the game instead of losing because I hoped my ADC could win the game.  What ADCs want is to be the player on their team with agency. What they fail to realize is that agency must come from another role because ADCs suck. They suck in early game when they need support to win lane for them. They suck in mid game when they need teams to ward and keep them safe in team fights. And they suck slightly less late game when they can dish out a lot of dps but still die to burst because other roles also can do a lot of dps meaning they need peel and protection and engage to keep them safe.   The only way ADCs dont suck is if another lane chooses to give up agency so the ADC can carry. For a support to give up global pressure so the ADC isnt left alone in lane. For the top laner to give up their lane and tp bot so the ADC gets ahead. For the jungler to build tank so the ADC has a frontline or camp bot so the ADC keeps a lead or for the mid laner to roam so the ADC has a safer laning experience. Most people dont want to give up agency for another role to be more fun. ADCs dont want to do that which is why we get complaint posts about how ADCs need to have more impact in games.   ADCs *can* have agency in games. It just requires another player doesnt.

There has been no reward to playing aggressively botlane for many seasons now which contributes to the idea that the AD lacks *agency* *~jazz hands~*  At some point you guys will get clued in to the fact that designing ADC items as they have—enforcing crit stacking having your mythic item be the only item with any expression of choice (realistically down to two who would have guessed?) crippling Mercurial Scimitar strangling access to lifesteal (to make the atrocity that is Shieldbow look palatable)—combined with this games progressive dismantling of damage over time patterns is has been and will remain the reason why ADCs feel like they do.

Supports on the weak end were literally just ward bots and a free bag of gold. The only impactful decision they had was if a ruby crystal was worth the 5 extra wards they couldve gotten.  Instead right now we have agency through their kits that can be achieved even pre-6.  If you take power away from that youre not going to get more agency for adcs. Youre just going to get supports with just enough clear to help adcs reset waves. Theres not any need to duel at that point its just about which adc can last hit and recall better.  OPs comparison to toplane is lacking jungle context. When toplane gets fucked over from bad trades and freezes the jungler has to come to fix it. In botlane the support is always present to help farm. If you take away support agency then all they can do break freezes.  They reference Season 6/7 anyone that played back then knows that ADCs didnt have more agency because supports were weak. Botlane as a whole just became more important because of elemental drakes. So the game became about how can I make sure my adc is ready to contest the second dragon? Which eventually discovered the minmax ardent censor meta.

Theres realistically two possible outcomes from weakening support agency/creating more 1v1 opportunities between adcs.  As the game is now an adc with noonquiver/dirk vs an adc with 2 long swords the prior always dictates the flow of the lane.  If you weaken support agency enough the lane is now only about item spikes for the adc. There is little way out for any adc to return from losing 2 waves. But the support can babysit there to help break freezes and ward for ganks.  If you increase 1v1 opportunities the issue is still that supports are their to mitigate losses.  If you want to maintain that support agency while trying your best to help adcs minmax. You get the Yuumi meta from worlds. Support/Jungle focuses on pushing in botlane at 4:30 so the adc can recall for noonquiver. Then the support perma roams while the adc 1v1s or 1v2s.  After all is said and done the primary difference between top/bot at this point is that a losing toplaner cant walk up to a wave. A losing adc will still have tools to get some farm out of it and theyre not as reliant on exp to be forced to walk into range as any minion dies.  The losing adc just wants their mythic their second item spike their 3rd item to compete in teamfights a survivability item. Because their kit lacks a way to compensate for it.  Any adc with a good enough steroid built into their kit usually lacks range or mobility. The adcs that generally have more agency have less damage and are even more reliant on items to fulfill their dps requirements.

Even in pro play the place where they usually always did better they became ult bots since like season 10 this year we have seen pro players building KRAKEN SLAYER on mf and it dealing 100 damage or less over ENTIRE GAMES because of how impossible it is to walk up into 550 range to auto attack in most team fights nowdays.  This is not an opnion this is facts go look at this worlds meta adcs not even when you have pro class team mates you can rely on its still not worth to make a comp around adcs anymore thanks to all of the systematic issues the role has.  So stop with this illusion of but actually adcs have a shitload of power you just cant see it when every single metric you can pull out shows otherwise.

The idea of a late game scaling powerhouse is long dead.  Back in the day when Fights actually lasted longer than 5 seconds marksmen were actually allowed to do their job. Youd be shitty all game and then at 40 minutes youd come online and finally be able to do something.  The direction that riot has taken the game doesnt allow that anymore. Marksmen cant do damage anymore because riot has continuously added damage to other roles(tanks bruisers assassin) through items for years now which essentially means you cant walk up to do damage because all the enemy [insert 0/3 assassin here] has to do is sneeze on their keyboard and one shot you. And the worst part is you can be a full item ahead and it still doesnt make a difference. Youre basically relying on your support to not be a monkey and give you a tiny bit of peel or youre not allowed to participate in fights until you see the enemy blow their load.  Riots been adding more damage on items/to champion kits for years now and what does ADC get?  -Lowered crit damage that doesnt even remotely compare to the amount of yesteryear even after you hit the 60% crit chance needed to proc IE passive  -You get way less experience now meaning youre gonna be 2+ levels down on everyone else by the time lane phase ends. Whats the reason for this change?  -New items like serpents fang/duskblade that let people reduce your survivability even more/stop you from even hitting the enemy if they get a kill  -Recent item changes now mean you have to give up a huge amount of damage if you want any survivability. Before the last item rework everything gave 25% crit chance meaning if you wanted you could have 4 crit items+whatever defense item you wanted. Now the only decent options without Gilpin your dps off the top or my head are Bloodthirster(decent item no complaints) or shieldbow which forces you to sacrifice Kraken Slayer or Galeforce  -To add onto that last point the amount of healing in the game has gotten so ridiculous that executioners calling is no longer a niche item that you only need against Soraka and Aatrox its now a core item pretty much every game.  Shit like this why you see ADC players crying so much all the time. The role has been in steady decline since about season 5 right now and only came back for a couple months because of ardent meta which riot conveniently looked at and said oh adc too strong and nerfed them again.  Its the least impactful role in the game. If you get ahead you cant carry without a competent team if you get behind youre useless and if you somehow make it to late game theres a pretty good chance that you just wont be able to walk within 6 screens of the enemy just because of who theyre playing.  /rant

You voice your dislike for Marksmen being ult bots while said ult bots also are the very same marksmen that HAS a lot of agency currently with champions like Jhin/Senna/Ashe. So if the experience of trading power for uility is not satisfactionary enough then is it not a matter of you having come to desire something which can not be found within the  current pool of marksmen?  To your other point Marksmen DOES have a lot of power that is why they are a constant pressence in both proplay and soloQ if they were neither satisfying to play nor were able to win games Statistics would reflect that as well as player sentiment.

Also point and click ranged dps is not very relevant at all in modern league (clearly not as powerful as youre trying to sell it) and i already told you why in the post above its not useless but its not needed at all your arguments would make sense in season 2 or 3 but we almost 10 years from that and the game has changed A LOT.  Currently adcs as a role simply has neither power or agency please prove me wrong and show everyone wheres all this power adcs currently have that everyone including even Doublelift are so oblivious to.

Very few can take the first shot but if they’re left untouched in team fights they can dish damage to the entire team without ever taking any themselves.

I said this 2 years ago when i still played the game. If ADCs are forced to play with team work than others should depend my actions too. In older seasons ADCs did something others couldnt and was important part of the team. You had to defend your bot laner otherwise you are pretty much done at sieging. Riot than decided to breakdown the barriers of other roles giving them something they lack before for balance purposes. (Mobility for Juggernauts is a great example) In meantime ADCs power shrunk way further because their unique strenghts as a role got introduced in other classes too  (Such as AP scaling Turret AAs) and their current respective strenghts got weaker.  Classes should get unique strenghts and weaknesses. A Juggernaut/Bruiser should be a sidelane monster with weak teamfighting but an ADC should be the best team fighter with the weakest sidelane power. Mages can provide utility and good team fighting but their sieging should be in the gutter. Assassins should be a early game secondary jungler who falls off pretty fast.(There is a reason why they are high risk-High reward class to begin with)  In S10 and S11 i had exactly zero fun to play this game.   Riot either puts ADCs on the same balancing perspective as other roles and completely abandons the Well since you cant dodge AAs you shouldnt be important as others or the role going to be dead and unfun to play. So far Riot choosed the secondary option. Atleast before S12 since i didnt played this pre-season but i check back if anything is up to change.

rbrp1l,rbrp1l,rbrp1l,Patch 11.24 Bug Megathread,ahritina,12/08/2021,8,Greetings Summoners!  With every new patch Riot introduces to balance out champions and items there are some unforeseen issues that creep up and cause disruption  during gameplay. We have noticed that these issues which eventually get fixed clutter up the subreddit immediately following the patch.

rbrmqt,rbrmqt,rbrmqt,Pets should be Camouflaged when they are inside the chemtech zone,FarmerMiserable7333,12/08/2021,62,Basically the title  But i find no reason not to be an actuall thing  Whats the point of a champion Been Camouflaged when his pets are following him and they are visible?  Basically it throws out of window the advantage of ambushing the enemy or try to escape from it when Camouflaged  (Pretty much like you are hiding in a bush)   If you not convinced here:  The best example is yorick  While try to roam or back door the enemy nexus through the chemtech Zone an enemy might left a ward and can easily see Yoricks pets because they arent Camouflaged   (standard wards cannot detect camouflaged champion only Control wards)  When Yorick is hiding in a bush his pets are hiding with him (champion special interaction)  If you think this is O.P.  Trust me  facechecking a bush is way more deadlier than try to detect an enemy in chemtech zone.
rbrmqt,hnpv30r,hnpv30r,Pets should be Camouflaged when they are inside the chemtech zone,IamLevels,12/08/2021,88,Chemtech zone shouldn’t exist in the first place.

rbrmqt,hnq0diu,hnq0diu,Pets should be Camouflaged when they are inside the chemtech zone,moody_P,12/08/2021,4,I agree make Illaois tentacles invisible in chem zones
rbrmqt,hnqewz4,hnqewz4,Pets should be Camouflaged when they are inside the chemtech zone,KnifferSineN,12/08/2021,1,If Riot would do this Asol would literally be worse than pets.
rbrmqt,hnqirs7,hnqirs7,Pets should be Camouflaged when they are inside the chemtech zone,facbok195,12/08/2021,1,> While try to roam or back door the enemy nexus through the chemtech Zone an enemy might left a ward and can easily see Yoricks pets because they arent Camouflaged   Actually they might not see them on a ward at least through the minimap. Yorick is currently bugged (a surprise I’m sure) and his pets don’t show up on the actual minimap.   Turns out Yorick is so fundamentally broken that his bugs out-glitch other bugs.
rbrmqt,hnpy8fq,hnpy8fq,Pets should be Camouflaged when they are inside the chemtech zone,WhereAreDosDroidekas,12/08/2021,20,It should just give pure invisibility so we have to play mundo dodgeball
rbrmqt,hnpxxf9,hnpxxf9,Pets should be Camouflaged when they are inside the chemtech zone,IWillNameMyChildZoe,12/08/2021,3,Camo should be costing health % per every second spent in it.
rbrmqt,hnq2g6x,hnq2g6x,Pets should be Camouflaged when they are inside the chemtech zone,IamLevels,12/08/2021,3,Make illaoi’s tentacles invisible in all fog of war as well. No reason the enemy team should be able to see her tentacles in bushes they have no vision in. You’re punished as illaoi for clearing vision because enemies can still always see her spawning them in fog of war.
rbrmqt,hnpylsy,hnpylsy,Pets should be Camouflaged when they are inside the chemtech zone,IamLevels,12/08/2021,0,As a heavy mundo player I’m all for it.

rbrmqt,hnqi2el,hnqi2el,Pets should be Camouflaged when they are inside the chemtech zone,SwoodPotatoChopper,12/08/2021,1,No need for the rest of the alphabet though
rbrmqt,hnq1nrn,hnq1nrn,Pets should be Camouflaged when they are inside the chemtech zone,IamLevels,12/08/2021,6,Junglers shouldn’t be punished for having to exist in the zone unless you want junglers to start farming you lane with you.
rbrmqt,hnq2noh,hnq2noh,Pets should be Camouflaged when they are inside the chemtech zone,IWillNameMyChildZoe,12/08/2021,1,The zone isnt active from first minute. It takes two dragons and has 1/6 chance to spawn so its a fair design.
rbrmqt,hnq33md,hnq33md,Pets should be Camouflaged when they are inside the chemtech zone,IamLevels,12/08/2021,1,Right but you are still punishing junglers as a whole with this idea. Regardless of when the zone appears and how often it’s bad game design because junglers don’t have much choice to avoid the zones.   1/6 of the time laners don’t take more damage for being in their lane junglers shouldn’t either.
rbrmqt,hnq3d1o,hnq3d1o,Pets should be Camouflaged when they are inside the chemtech zone,IWillNameMyChildZoe,12/08/2021,1,Well the zones could give a vamp vs jg camps for smite users.
rbrmqt,hnq41qf,hnq41qf,Pets should be Camouflaged when they are inside the chemtech zone,IamLevels,12/08/2021,1,This would be more fair. Junglers can still farm without losing hp but idling in jungle waiting gets you punished.
rbrmqt,hnqomkp,hnqomkp,Pets should be Camouflaged when they are inside the chemtech zone,FarmerMiserable7333,12/08/2021,1,I do actually know that but i wanna address the example ....with yorick been fully patched without bugs (one can dream)
rbrmqt,hnqtyxp,hnqtyxp,Pets should be Camouflaged when they are inside the chemtech zone,Alex_Wizard,12/08/2021,1,The Chemtech rift just needs to go in general. It’s the only Dragon that fundamentally changes how you have to play the game. Sure Ocean soul may give more bushes to play from or Cloud Soul may help you rotate faster to a skirmish but chem tech fundamentally upends how and where you need to change vision.

rbrd2x,rbrd2x,rbrd2x,A short survey about your favourite Champions,Tressoli,12/08/2021,58,Hey!   Im conducting a small research on LoL champion design and player preferences.   I made this super short survey (5 minutes I swear) and it would be great if you could share your opinion with me! Of course its all completely anonymous.  LINK (Google Forms): [https://forms.gle/tZX5SainEcrDhdgL7](https://forms.gle/tZX5SainEcrDhdgL7)  Also if you have any thoughts you can spark a conversation directly here!  Thanks a lot :D
rbrd2x,hnqe2rw,hnqe2rw,A short survey about your favourite Champions,tigercule,12/08/2021,1,> Are there any champions you enjoy playing quite often despite not being your favourites? Can you explain why?  I dont think I understand this question can you explain? Wouldnt enjoying playing a champion often make them a favourite?
rbrd2x,hnqc0q7,hnqc0q7,A short survey about your favourite Champions,DarkBello28,12/08/2021,1,Nice to see a survey with a different main focus and new questions! Wishing you the best for the research would love to see the results here as well ^^.
rbrd2x,hnqex15,hnqex15,A short survey about your favourite Champions,Arty--,12/08/2021,1,Yeah thats what I thought as well similar to the question tho I have champs that are among my favorite but I DONT play often such as Akali and Fiora but thats because I dont like mid and top lane much
rbrd2x,hnqfxir,hnqfxir,A short survey about your favourite Champions,WompDoo,12/08/2021,1,I answered Vayne I dont like her look story or personality but I like her gameplay and do well with her. So she doesnt fit in my favorites but I do play her often.
rbrd2x,hnqg5ls,hnqg5ls,A short survey about your favourite Champions,dank_as_fuck,12/08/2021,1,Often times yea but you for example I’m and AD carry main who sometimes enjoys playing Camille or Diana. They’re not necessarily my favorites as ADC champs are. I just like their kit and play style. I think it applies in that way
rbrd2x,hnqjg6e,hnqjg6e,A short survey about your favourite Champions,infinityoncorktree,12/08/2021,1,Whats your favorite food? Do you eat that everyday? Probably not. Pizza might be your favorite but you cant eat that everyday. Gotta have some tacos or a sandwich. You enjoy those but youd rather have pizza. You never choose to eat brussel sprouts. Thats not something you like and definitely not your favorite.
rbrd2x,hnqk6j9,hnqk6j9,A short survey about your favourite Champions,lyzaros,12/08/2021,1,I just assumed you have one favorite champion and that question was asking for your next favorites.
rbrd2x,hnqhex6,hnqhex6,A short survey about your favourite Champions,tigercule,12/08/2021,1,As a support main it breaks my heart that two of my four favourite champions in the game are Viego and Aphelios who my team wont allow me to even fuck around with as support in norms (and I dont want to just get reported in solo queue). :(
rbrd2x,hnqoy5c,hnqoy5c,A short survey about your favourite Champions,xMetix,12/08/2021,1,Might have asked for rank to compare the answers of someone invested competitively to casual players. I know Im probably in the minority of master+ players that dont care about meta (even tho I was fortunate for the last year with my main being stupidly overpowered :D)
rbrd2x,hnqqobm,hnqqobm,A short survey about your favourite Champions,Tressoli,12/08/2021,1,Im interested in WHY people like some champions - what elements make them stand out more than others.  You can have a favourite champion which you play a lot or like very much but you can also have some champions that you really really enjoy but are not in your top-tier list.  I can give you an example: my favourite champion in Jhin which I use quite often when I play ADC but I also love Volibear because I like his ability rotation and the overall feeling when I play it. Nonetheless I would never say that Volibear is one of my favourite champions.  That question basically means: I know that you like to play some champions even if they are not in your wall of fame - what do you think is the reason?.
rbrd2x,hnqrtit,hnqrtit,A short survey about your favourite Champions,Pegarlic,12/08/2021,1,I play a lot of Viego even though its probably one of if not my least favorite character design in the game just because Im decent at it and the general kit feels good to me.    I play almost no Lucian even though he is my favorite champion because I despise going 5-0 in lane and then always evening out because his range is so utterly shite.
rbrd2x,hnqtzex,hnqtzex,A short survey about your favourite Champions,Xgunter,12/08/2021,1,It would be nice to have reasons why seperate to the champion answers i felt like my answers had to be quite condensed to avoid being long-winded.

Previously you could switch off these in options but rito have to promote their show for god knows how long.

rbqsgn,rbqsgn,rbqsgn,Why is it even allowed to ban your teamates champion?,FishbroOnYouTube,12/08/2021,0,I cant tell you how many games I have had where a teamate ran it down because another teamate had a bad game with them and decided to target grief them for the previous grief only for the person who got their champ banned to repay the fool by intentionally feeding. Both are extremely toxic to each other throughout the game and both end up getting banned afterwards for their griefing.  All of this can simply be avoided by not allowing teamates to ban other teamates champions.  It would also cut down on the number of dodges we would experience.
rbqsgn,hnpof9m,hnpof9m,Why is it even allowed to ban your teamates champion?,sirhobbles,12/08/2021,4,i Do think ti can be an annoying trolling tool but the answer is simple.   Pick order.   If your lastpick is hovering whatever this patches completely broken zero counterplay 80% winrate bullshit is and the enemy has firstpick it is often just not worth the risk.
rbqsgn,hnpo0e9,hnpo0e9,Why is it even allowed to ban your teamates champion?,hokeypokie_,12/08/2021,10,I agree with u/SNSDave if the last player is hovering an overpowered champ the chance that champ falls all the way down to them is slim. Safer to ban it.  You can change the game all you want its not going to change the mentality and attitude of the players.
rbqsgn,hnpush1,hnpush1,Why is it even allowed to ban your teamates champion?,JedstarRomero17,12/08/2021,2,It has to be in a competitive environment.   The crybabies who int after their champ is banned must be eradicated from the game though. Those who ban the champ generally have a good reason.  If you are an otp you should be stuck in lower ranks.
rbqsgn,hnq0xc1,hnq0xc1,Why is it even allowed to ban your teamates champion?,RealRadya,12/08/2021,2,I love banning my midlaner’s 40 game 12% win rate yasuo pick and when they lock in disco nunu and run it down it’s literally no different than if they played yasuo AND everyone reports him.   Win win.
rbqsgn,hnpq7e3,hnpq7e3,Why is it even allowed to ban your teamates champion?,Totalballbag,12/08/2021,3,just because my teammate wants to play yasuo doesnt mean im gonna let the other team pick him first  or let my teammate play yasuo
rbqsgn,hnpnob8,hnpnob8,Why is it even allowed to ban your teamates champion?,SNSDave,12/08/2021,2,People would dodge more if they cant ban last pick from hovering an op Champ or playing with an otp with a 21% win rate.
rbqsgn,hnpnqri,hnpnqri,Why is it even allowed to ban your teamates champion?,maruchops,12/08/2021,0,This is a player behavior issue imo. Someone intentionally doing this obviously deserves never to play again. I think riot needs a huge overhaul on the judiciary side.

rbqsgn,hnpvt27,hnpvt27,Why is it even allowed to ban your teamates champion?,Naymliss,12/08/2021,-1,Banning someones champion because they have a poor winrate on it or not liking that champion on your team is ... Kinda scummy to me. Not only is it probably not going to help but youre also going to most likely tilt your teammates from the start and youre also going to get a pick you like even less most of the time.  I get not wanting to play against a champion but again the risk of tilting a teammate is not worth it the vast majority of the time.  Sincerely someone who is tired of teammates getting angy at each other before the game even starts.

He would suck on any other champion aswell. You actively pissed him off and created your loss by banning his yasuo.  Ill take my chances with the terrible yasuo over inting nunu
rbqsgn,hnpp8bf,hnpp8bf,Why is it even allowed to ban your teamates champion?,aithosrds,12/08/2021,1,This.  I don’t intentionally ban people’s champs to be mean but yeah if someone is not first pick and they are hovering an OP champ they have a really terrible win rate on and I don’t want the enemy team to pick I’ll ban it and apologize.  You can’t ban people for doing that.
rbqsgn,hnpo9mo,hnpo9mo,Why is it even allowed to ban your teamates champion?,FishbroOnYouTube,12/08/2021,-2,It doesnt matter you cant permaban anyone from playing league. You ban them their IP address etc they can just buy a new account for $10-20 as china and many south american/african countries have wages that make this price very gracious. The community will always be toxic due to this fact. Instead of telling people how to act maybe figure out why theyre acting the way they are.  Example: Criminal burglarizes house to get canned food maybe spare them a second chance and help them before they go to jail and permanently become a career criminal.
rbqsgn,hnq0gq0,hnq0gq0,Why is it even allowed to ban your teamates champion?,Lordj09,12/08/2021,1,I mean it only doesnt hekp because people get irrationally angry at team bans any time the opposing team bans the 20% winrate irelia or zed that player plays their 60% annie.
rbqsgn,hnpxryq,hnpxryq,Why is it even allowed to ban your teamates champion?,FishbroOnYouTube,12/08/2021,0,Agreed its very tiresome.

rbqsgn,hnq8v4a,hnq8v4a,Why is it even allowed to ban your teamates champion?,sirhobbles,12/08/2021,1,I often will. though that isnt always possible. Our TEAM might not have first pick not just the player sometimes i have a high priority pick i would like to first pick. I have all champs but not everyone does meaning pick swapping isnt always possible.

rbqsgn,hnpp123,hnpp123,Why is it even allowed to ban your teamates champion?,maruchops,12/08/2021,0,We know why people act this way: control. Players dont want to feel out of control so they take it in their own hands at the expense of everyone. Riot making their report system so weak perpetualizes the cycle. People dont get punished for bad behavior so people act out more and it feeds itself as an abusive cycle.

rbqns5,rbqns5,rbqns5,How to reset your MMR?,rank_dont_matter,12/08/2021,0,I need to know this how to reset my MMR? Is there anyway to reset it? It really hinders my climb. The match making is very bad. I need to reset it.  I am sick of it constantly every game need to hard carry 2 to 4 inter on my team that dies more than 15 time.  I literally lose more than I win because of these inters. That literally dont give a damn about it.
rbqns5,hnpo3rw,hnpo3rw,How to reset your MMR?,EldianRestorationist,12/08/2021,8,There is a soft MMR reset when the new season starts. Otherwise many people always say I cannot climb my MMR is ruined only to make a new account and end up in the same rank with the same LP gains eventually. Its not the MMR that is ruined its just that you found your rank.

rbqns5,hnpn7ha,hnpn7ha,How to reset your MMR?,maruchops,12/08/2021,2,No way to do it besides lose a fuck ton or make another account.  My accounts 9 years old and has been consistently Silver 1-4 since I started. New account from last year is plat 3.
rbqns5,hnpt9a1,hnpt9a1,How to reset your MMR?,Gladersvamp,12/08/2021,1,Dont know about the Normal MMR reset. But if u transfer ur account to a different region and transfer back it will reset ur rank mmr and u need to do the placement again.Yes i suck in League and was stuck i gold. I transferred my account from EUW to turkey and back.Now im plat 4. But i think i would reach that even if didnt transferred. The problem i was hard stuck bc i play 10000000 different champions every game and different roles but after the transfer i choose 4 champs i liked and just play them and ofc i turned of all chat so my mental didnt break when teammates cursed each other and so.Good luck on the grind!  EDIT: I wrote plat 3 but reached plat4.
rbqns5,hnpw7nn,hnpw7nn,How to reset your MMR?,BLUELAMBORGHINI64,12/08/2021,1,Transfer to turkey and back   Edit : you can also dodge your promos to reset it I believe
rbqns5,hnq05wl,hnq05wl,How to reset your MMR?,ShotcallerBilly,12/08/2021,1,You cannot reset your MMR.  Everyone’s rank is soft reset at the start of the season.    Being able to reset would be abusable in so many ways.  Your teammates aren’t the reason you can’t climb.  You have to accept this fact if you don’t then you’ll stay frustrated and never climb.
rbqns5,hnpt7h3,hnpt7h3,How to reset your MMR?,MrThematic,12/08/2021,2,Unless after 900 games playing for fun you decide to give a try and actually try to rank up and learn meta strategies and improving yourself.   At this point whatever the level you get itll be almost impossible to reach your new real rank

On top of that Riot even BUFFED her on patch 11.21 and in fact the buffs are huge which just make her a pain to play against in both Midlane and Support. Worth mentioning is also the fact that she is S+ in both roles.  &#x200B  I just dont understand why Riot refuses to nerf her - since S11 begun she has only gotten buffs I think its time to change that.  &#x200B  The stats that I link are also from patch 11.23 but nothing will change anyway since she and her core items remain untouched. If anything she will shine even brighter after 11.24 since her main counters are getting indirect nerfs.

As far as nobody has provided a balanced reason about her rise in both pickrate and winrate then your argument is completely invalid and Im correct.  &#x200B  Its just funny how some people run out of arguments and bring up flairs but still get upvoted because r/leagueoflegends in a nutshell is just full of assassin haters.

Shes slightly over performing but not enough to deserve any meaningful changes.   Its kinda funny that you dont mention Viktor despite him having a higher winrate AND pickrate.   >I just dont understand why Riot refuses to nerf her - since S11 begun she has only gotten buffs I think its time to change that.  And she had a low winrate and a very low playrate despite most of those buffs. The only buffs that really mattered were the massive ones towards the end of the season.  Your post seems like less of a concern about balance and more of either just losing a game to her and rageposting or an irrational hatred of a champion.

She is around 50% across all elos and the majority of her pickrate comes from support.  Also she is an immobile mage in a roaming meta having a Lux mid innately takes some pressure off the enemy botlane as they know she cant come down safely or quickly without getting blown up in river.   Further while her kit is a straightforward burst dmg combo she also has super easy counterplay. If she whiffs a q any common midlaner can all in her immobile ass and kill her or zone her from her wave before she gets hourglass.  Definitely not a problem champion compared to many high winrate/pickrate champions like Vayne right now due to how straightforward counterplay is and how restricted her defensive options are to itemization.

The ultimate is a nuke. It has a similar cd than ezreal whose ult at 1 or two items is just a sting  Safe laning extremely long range E and Q that can be blocked by two minions. Her E has a big ass hitbox and with the dmg that it carries i is basicly impossible to dodge sideways. The moment u come close her q will hit and her shield provides enough safety to her to not get insta oneshot.  The high base dmg and low ultimate cd means that almost every time a q hits u she can E+R you which does more dmg than ur hp.  Her dmg is so high that after 6 she literally doesnt need the passive auto attack to kill you.  Lux has a stable early game and loses nothing late. At 3 or 4 items her q+e combo can kill a squishy. If she has strong early game why she has good scaling too.  The problem is that lux is so liked that the idiots with no hands bring down the winrate but in a real players hand it is toxic

Realistically Lux ult CD at level 6 is 60s and Im not counting ANY Ability Haste.  &#x200B  Ulting an entire wave instantly kills the backline minions and in combination with E can make the wave disappear in seconds even early game. Due to this she performs exceptionally well vs any roaming champion that isnt Zed (perhaps Im missing someone correct me if Im wrong) since she can take exhaust/barrier which denies any threat in lane and that in combination with her nice wave shoves - waveclear can easily punish the enemy from roaming or going for a recall.  &#x200B  Good Lux players will always use their R on the wave whenever its up rather than using it to try to kill their opponent making the game insanely hard for roaming champions since they are forced to stay in the lane so they dont stay behind in XP.  &#x200B  This champion on the right hands is an absolute terror to face in Midlane.

Is lux too strong because she is op or is she too strong because others are too weak and statistics cant answer that meaning theyre not a reason since a reason should tell you specifically WHY not give guess work.  I dont have to give a reason about lux because its not relevant if statistics cant give a specific explanation theyre not a reason since thats again what a reason is.  And those numbers are vague like everyone seems to have different opinions on what stats a champ needs to be op which probably means your statistics arent specific enough to be used. Example people in this thread some say that her stats are fine.  Not to mention its a VERY boring discussion whats better people arguing over numbers that dont have a clear meaning or people actually talking about a champion and why or not theyre op.

rbq8ux,rbq8ux,rbq8ux,League toxicity,Stardustlove88,12/08/2021,0,So I’ve seen a few people comment on the toxicity of league and I understand that it is very toxic. But that is part of the game. If you don’t like it then mute everyone. I haven’t met a single person who takes anything said in league to heart. I guarantee everyone has atleast once said something toxic in a game. If you don’t like the toxicity then either mute the chat or don’t play it. Simple. Honestly the toxicity is even funny sometimes. Instead of trying to remove all chat mute your chat. If league removes all chat then we won’t get funny moments where a jax and sett are farming in between enemy’s towers cause they called a truce from the beginning. Or where they dance in the middle of lane waiting for the next wave. All of my friends were laughing so hard. If you can’t take the toxicity then just mute chat or don’t play. Don’t ruin it for us.
rbq8ux,hnpqqoo,hnpqqoo,League toxicity,KatyaBelli,12/08/2021,2,If you dont want to get shot dont go to this part of town  if a girl doesnt want to get raped she shouldnt go to parties alone.  if you dont want to raise a child you shouldnt have sex  Lots of arguments shift the burden of responsibility from the wrongdoer to others. The tactic exists to muddy the waters and make the people seeking change or improvement seem unreasonable.   To frame it more simply: some people want more to be done about abuse they endure and your counterpoint is that I dont care and am not personally affected so I am taking a stance that they must be wrong or lying and cannot seek change.   The world exists beyond your lived experience. If you dont want to help those seeking positive change in an acknowledged negative (verbal harrassment and toxicity) have to humility to step out of their way and realize that people have different experiences.

I’m saying that instead of ruining the good parts of league for the rest of us because you don’t know how to get past a comment made by some random that your probably never gonna meet play with or see ever again just mute your chat. Easy as that. You don’t deal with any toxicity and we still get to have fun. Honestly if you get hurt by anything ( there are a few exceptions obviously) that is said in a game that lasts at most an hour then you’ve got bigger issues than that comment.

rbq8ux,hnpmgr7,hnpmgr7,League toxicity,Stardustlove88,12/08/2021,1,So what your saying is that games like cod battlefield halo. Anything that has any type of chat that does the exact same thing should have chat turned off. Because they are no different. I gave a simple solution instead of ruining it for everyone. If you don’t like it mute it. If you don’t mute it then that’s your problem.
rbq8ux,hnpmvlh,hnpmvlh,League toxicity,maruchops,12/08/2021,1,Nowhere did I even nearly indicate that this is my stance. I didnt even advocate for that specific resolution so stop projecting your anger on me.  Your simple solution doesnt solve a problem it shoves it to the side because it simply doesnt affect you.  Youre telling me that youre totally fine with people getting abused because it makes you laugh and that if people have a problem with being abused thats their fault...for some reason?  Leagues not that toxic.  Yeah when its YOU doing it.
rbq8ux,hnpns94,hnpns94,League toxicity,Stardustlove88,12/08/2021,1,The funny toxicity I was talking about what when the whole enemy team was flaming me because I was half healthing them with 1 q as a karma support. But regardless your the kind of person that is only gonna see it one way. If you get hurt by a comment made by a random then you either shouldn’t be playing league or you need to mute everyone the moment you get in game. And it is a simple solution because then those people don’t get hurt and ruin it for everyone else and legit 80% of the league community can go about their day.

That should give you nice idea of current meta broken items the fact that if you feed Trynda top the game is over for you and your team etc. )   Gl hf.

I opened one of the chests and got ultimate mf skin (gun goddess) but i dont own miss fortune. I could buy her and flex the skin but i dont really like playing miss fortune (or any adc lol theyre weak af currently). I just wanted to ask if i reroll this skin with two other epic ones  will i get a skin thats less than an epic one or will i get an epic or above skin? EDIT: the comments told me that rerolling gives a random skin so i didnt want to risk it. I just purchased mf champion and unlocked the skin. Gg see you on the rift guys!

rboxgo,rboxgo,rboxgo,Projects for insane people: Lissandra jungle,peorg,12/08/2021,18,Hi im currently on vacation and as fate would have it this vacation unfortunately coincides with a nationwide lockdown due to the pandemic situation. Since theres not much to do outside Ive decided to go back to a pet project of mine which is searching for a way to make Lissandra jungle somewhat viable.  The point of the project is that Lissandras kit in my opinion is actually amazing for ganks. E is a great tool for surprise attacks W keeps the enemy laner in place and R can completely lock him down via point and click if need be. But that may also be the reason why Riot has abstained from granting her the same jungle buffs they gave to a number other champs a while ago (even to Morgana for some reason).  Anyhow Ive spent some time in practice tool and lonesome bot matches to figure out a way to jungle with Liss while circumventing her early fragility vs jungle monsters. That is my solution so far.  Runes:  https://preview.redd.it/dj64848nla481.png?width=938&format=png&auto=webp&s=22c456ceec163ac5e1e7e2527eb9bd58bb015141  Aftershock and font are meant as a helpful tool for ganks/teamfights while Overgrowth helps you stack some health while jungling. Conditioning may be replaced by any of the other options but a little more longevity for fights wont hurt. Time Warp is a necessity since the first two clearing rounds are going to be painful. Biscuits help but you could also be fine with another choice if youre good at kiting jungle monsters . Since Lissandra has decent scaling and is utilized as a ganker/initializer here this should work without Sorcery.  That is the most viable path (no leash) ive figured out so far:Start with ember or hail + refill. Go Red \[Smite L2\] - Chickens - Wolves \[Smite\] - Reset (ca 3:10 buy Amp Tome) - Gromp \[L3\] - Blue - Top Scuttler - Wolves \[few seconds wait time before spawn L4\] - Chickens - Krugs \[Smite\] - Reset (ca 7:00 buy Lost Chapter) - Red \[Smite L5\] - Wolves - Gromp - Chickens - Krugs \[L6 Smite\] - Reset (ca 10:10 buy Amp Tome Ruby Boots if you want)  Starting red seems like the sensible thing to do since the healing helps and mana is not an issue at this point. I tried starting with a full clear on red but that appears to be impossible to survive without a leash. Same goes for a full clear on blue side Gromp/Krugs just hit too hard at this stage.  You can also take the opposite route (Blue - Wolves - Chickens -...) but as far as my trial runs showed youll need to reset for the 3rd time just pre L6 and lose around a minute. I am of course open to other route suggestions experienced junglers might see better paths here.  I recognize that 10 mins to L6 is not amazing and being pretty  susceptible to invades by most dedicated jungers doesnt help. But keep in mind that a) starting with a leash could delay your resets enable a more efficient route and thus speed your leveling up considerably. Also b) I suck at kiting jungle monsters and forgot maybe 2-3 E I couldve used to move around quicker without impacting my DPS on the camps so there definitely is potential for optimization even without a leash.  After getting L3 or blue you should of course take a look at the state of top lane since your 3 basic abilities can definitely suffice to pull of an early gank or at least force a flash from the enemy toplaner. Your opponents might know that you started red and probably wont expect you top. After finishing your first item (Everfrost) you can solo drake if you want but since you only barely survive it better have your team assist.  Is that viable? Well that depends on your definition of viable but probably no (hence the title of this post).  However if youre playing in a somewhat coordinated team that can react quickly if the enemy jungler invades it might work as a niche pick.  Thank you for your attention.
rboxgo,hnpkbgu,hnpkbgu,Projects for insane people: Lissandra jungle,TheRealGouki,12/08/2021,11,I tested it out it not that bad but I would probably go more tank ap than full ap and just be a stun bot for the team something like frost fire demonic Embrace cosmic drive horizon focus and acrhangels staff.  With something like predator sudden impact eyeballs and ravenous with transcendence and water walking
rboxgo,hnpvrqc,hnpvrqc,Projects for insane people: Lissandra jungle,tweke,12/08/2021,4,Liss and Vex are two ap champs that I think could be great additions to the jungle if given the opportunity. Jungle is in desperate need of more ap diversity.
rboxgo,hnpxawn,hnpxawn,Projects for insane people: Lissandra jungle,SirJakeDeJuke,12/08/2021,4,Hello!   Master Tier jgl here.  Just tried it in practice tools. The clear speed is insanely bad but it can work.     I just tried starting with 3 pots instead of refill. IF you do that you dont need level 2 reset and can clear to level 4.       Other tip dont go blue after clearing wolfs. Go Gromp cuz it gives HP.      You really need a good leash to make it work tho.
rboxgo,hnpzuhb,hnpzuhb,Projects for insane people: Lissandra jungle,HowyNova,12/08/2021,1,Just tried it a bit. My general goal was to be able to contest scuttle  and have gank opportunities asap.  Went Predator/Futures Market/Time Warp Tonic with Smite/TP. Only bought ember/hail + 1 pot  Red [Smite L2] - Chickens - Reset(buy boots) - TP - Blue - Gromp(Pull when blue is 700~ to double camp)[Smite L3] - Scuttle  If you kite well enough you wont have to use any pots up to L3.  With Futures Market: If you start refill or 3 pots after Red/Chickens you can get boots with Futures Market. If start 2 pots you can get Amp Tome. If you start 1 pot red/chicken for boots and secure a scuttle you can reset for Ionian boots.  Scuttle will probably be contested so Id ideally want solo lanes to push wave 3/4 to help you contest. Your goal is similar to snowbally junglers tho. Youll never be able to outfarm/outpace regular junglers that can clear indefinitely and solo drag. So youll have to flip for an early kill/assist L3. If you can secure a sololane gank that early you should be able to get Sorc boots even with just an assist. If you get first blood try your best to get wolves then you can Sorc boots + Amp tome.

rboxgo,hnqdljp,hnqdljp,Projects for insane people: Lissandra jungle,HowyNova,12/08/2021,1,I think clear times is the wrong way to go. Youll always lose compared to other junglers. Its better to try and think of how to make your lvl 2/3 gank happen sooner.  I made a comment here about using Predator. Boots is the most reliable back(if you get invaded and need to clear something else). Predator for ganks is your safest option.

rboi2q,rboi2q,rboi2q,How to keep good mental while team feeds,Embarrassed_Tower_52,12/08/2021,3,JG main.     Watching people just run it down and squandering any lead the team has makes me so upset.. I can have chat muted but still cant get over the constant unavoidable deaths my team has.      Am I perfect? HELL NO by no means I make plenty of mistakes and learn from them game to game.    Do I at least attempt the basics? Absolutely!    When Im doing poorly its extremely frustrating and I do everything I can to mitigate the losses while keeping my pings to a minimum and my mouth shut.   But game after game its just too much watching your lanes crash and burn. Im lvl 27 and it has taken me many weeks and a lot of games to get there but for some reason people get in my game saying Im new and while I respect their lack of knowledge why am I getting paired with them?   People have a lot of different pet peeves but my biggest is not contributing equally when everyone is working towards a common goal. I dont even want to keep trying when it looks like the under performing teammate isnt either. At first I had the go next mentality but now I dont even want to play anymore. Its not fun playing so far behind or worse being ahead while your team is miles behind you.      I understand its just a game but I put a lot of time and effort into improving so this sentiment is more backhanded than helpful. Im not sure if this post is in the right place but it definitely made me feel better typing it. I hope someone understands. Thanks.

Plus its just better to spend tempo on ganking bot or top or to place vision in the enemy jgl or river.  &#x200B  Pantheon is a great example for that. You go for cookies and time warp tonic anyways so you dont really have desperate mana issues at start. And by the time the second blue is up you already went back at least once or twice because you have enough money to get your first component.  &#x200B  Also: Junglers (me included) tend to go for the second blue immediately after taking first drake (meaning red side) which allows us to get the first item just a little faster than without blue (or you use the money to spend it on a control ward)

Why am i relating this to Kayle and Urgot? Well since the release of the new lethal tempo keystone (which sounds really synergistic on a champion that has so much onhit and an aa reset double attack) plenty of champions have tried it and realized that some parts of their kit doesnt work as you would think examples here are kayle waves and urgot shotgun knees. but these are not the only ones shyvana W does additional onhit damage to people closeby her. During **Dragonform** and with **lethal tempo fully stacked** [ you can attack enemies without them taking the w onhit damage. Add to this a rapidfire cannon and enemies can even be out of your Dragonform q 2nd hit range](https://imgur.com/6DbUUgB)    Speaking of lethal tempo did you know [humanform Q gives 2 stacks while Dragonform always only gives 1 no matter how many opponents get hit?](https://imgur.com/8KHuuds)      At least the [w onhit still works vs secondary targets](https://imgur.com/KchAie3)         While were already here lets talk about Shyvana Q which might be intended to work this way but if that is truly the case then she needs a qol fix        Shyvana Q interactions | Humanform | Dragonform ----------------------|---------|---------- Pets | [2 hits](https://imgur.com/ekgt4ru) | [1 hit](https://imgur.com/s2r3IVV) Escaping Champions | [2 hits](https://imgur.com/qxdciMV) | [1 hit](https://imgur.com/V6L4eIo) Wards | [2 hits](https://imgur.com/XuyBGwn)  | [2 hits](https://imgur.com/SEsRQT6) Still standing champions | 2 hits | usually 2 hits      This works on all pets that dont count dmg but number of aas like teemo shrooms gp barrels nidalee and jhin traps and so on...      as a person who has ~1200 shyvana games over the past couple seasons and someone who has hit masters on Euw playing her toplane i really dont understand why her Dragonfrom Q has to be a downgrade from her humanform Q most of the time when her ulti states that the ability would be empowered. at least make dragonform Q functionally similar to humanform Q on the main target.      Oh also a special treat for those who survived my post this long [Shyvana Dragonform Q not consumed on missed lasthit with no other aa targets nearby the empowered attack does 0 damage afterwards.](https://imgur.com/Xc77RaP)        Shyv has also a serverdependent bug where casting Dragonform E right when she transforms back to human form on a server tick has her humanform E cooldown reset.      [All the Clips in 1 Imgur link](https://imgur.com/a/vVSYuSf)  Also if there are any redditors with all mordekaiser skins on EUW i wanna figure out what skin combinations of Shyvana /Morde  skins produce visual vomit when dragonform shyvana presses w in mordekaiser r i wanna get some footage from that to the masses.

Thank you for bringing notice to the bugs though I kept experiencing that Q one in dragon form and it drove me nuts in small trades against Illaoi in toplane.     I assume her rework was also looked away from because theyd have 0 clue what even to do with her when champs can walk over and take her kit as passives and fear touching her due to Statstick category.

The three things with Lethal Tempo that Riot should look at are:  \- Dragon form Q gives only 1 stack of LT when the main target is a champion while human form Q gives 2 vs a champion. All other Keystones treat Dragon form Q as two basic attacks just like human form Q (such as Conq & PTA) with the caveat that the second hit only registers if the target is in the cleave Area of Effect at the end of the attacks wind up time.  \- Dragon form Q cleave Area of Effect is your dragon form basic attack range + 50. However it does not include bonus range from sources other than the bonus for being in dragon form. This is problematic as unlike human Q the second hit only connects with the primary target if they are still in the AoE. This means with LT bonus range you miss out on the second hit vs a max AA range target if they move as much as 1 pixel further away during the wind up.  \- The Lethal Tempo bonus range gives enough attack range to attack targets that are out of range for Burnout (W) at all ranks of Dragons Decent (R). This problem does not come up in human form.  \---  E reset might still be possible in edge cases but for the most part it will never occur as at the start of the cast if your fury is low enough to have dragon form expire during the cast it will set your fury high enough that dragon form will time out after the cast is completed.  \---  Kraken Slayers passive is on attack for ranged champions. For melee champions it is on hit instead. Therefore it is working correctly on Shyvana.

In the clip you landed 4 attacks under HoB while using 1 reset which is how it works on any other champion.

Shyvana Q shouldnt consume a single stack resulting in auto-q-auto-auto. Thats how it works with other auto resets. Yes Shyvana Q is technically two auto attacks but that shouldnt matter. Any other champ can do auto-reset-auto-auto why cant Shyvana?

The Dragon form Q being changed to scale with bonus AA range should be similar priority to Urgot and Kayle changes as it makes the ability feel bad.  Burnout is only if they are going to recode how its range works so that it is calculated based on AA range. Otherwise simply increasing the range would be a straight buff and would be subject to whether Shyvana is considered in need of a buff or not.  \---  [Recoding Burnout is justified as currently the range detection is inconsistent between the regular ticks and the on hit triggered damage.](https://www.reddit.com/r/shyvanamains/comments/qxloc3/shyvana_burnout_bug/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) On further testing it is a fickle thing that depends on the direction you attack from. Which likely means it is a floating point math rounding error that occurs because they are not doing the exactly same order of operations leading to different results.  But the reason it comes up at Rank 3 ult is all about the size increase. The reason more size % increase is needed from other other sources therefore means they are giving less. So likely they are increasing by a % of human form model even in dragon form.  For bonus points the range indicator for Burnout only shows the human form range regardless of being in dragon or human form. You can use this to compare how dragon form area compares with human form. While the additional ranks account for the bonus range they give to a basic attacks the rank 1 R does not increase the range of Burnout by the same amount it does your AA range. This plus size not being accounted for is why LT bonus range puts you out of Burnout range.

It was an undocumented change. Also in the same patch they claimed Dragon Q would correctly deal 2 points of damage to things like Illaoi tentecles. They did not infact fix that.  Bonus: as an undocumented change in that patch the second hit of Dragon Q lost the ability to crit.

It use to do so therefore allowing you to 4 attacks in with Hail one of which was Q empowered (using AA reset abilities like Twin Bite gives +1 stack to use).  At some point in early season 10 something changed and Q started consuming an extra stack.  Then in patch 10.14 as one of many undocumented changes they fixed it from Human Q   so that it only consumes one stack (Dragon Q still consuming 2 stacks). This is how it is on live. Human Q consumes one Hail stack Dragon Q consumes 2 stacks.  Potentially Dragon Q might only consume one stack if the primary target moves out of the cleave AoE as the second hit in dragon form only lands if they are in the cleave AoE. This is not particularly convenient to test.

rbo81l,rbo81l,rbo81l,An idea for better frostfire,Burbund,12/08/2021,2,As chemtank got immolate removed i wondered if frostfure really needs it  I got to an idea that instead of dealing damage frostfire could make a weak permament slowing aura (5-10% slow) aside from its current frostfield (of course it wouldnt stack) or some kind of antidash capabilities (bear with me xd) like when someone dashes in around You he gets slowed a little for up to 2 seconds (like 10-15% slow)  Slow numbers are of the top of my head but the idea is for the slow to help with lack of mobility of tanks and in teamfights ofc but to make it weak enough so mobile champs wouldnt be grounded by it   Sorry if You think its stupid its just an idea to help tanks but to not make them just deal more damage
rbo6x4,rbo6x4,rbo6x4,The real problem with ADCs,WantToDie78,12/08/2021,0,There have been several posts recently talking about ADC being a bad role but they all miss the real reason why that is in my oppinion.   The real reason behind the “lmao ADC in 2021/2022??” state the game is currently in is entirely because of the existence of melee crit champs. Viego yasuo 1 and 2 tryn etc. These guys all use crit items better than ADCs due to having much more mobility utility and damage.  Crit items have to be nerfed because they would be abused by these guys if it got too good. There’s no real good defensive item for ADCs that isn’t also being abused at a much higher power level by melee crit champs.  So how could this be fixed? Most crit items should be nerfed for melee champs similarly to how ezreal got almost every bruiser item changed for ranged. In fact I don’t know why this isn’t already in the game but riot being a small indie company probably forgot it was an option. It realistically makes no sense that bruiser items are nerfed on ADCs but the opposite isn’r true when there are so many melees abusing the items.  This makes it easier for riot to design defensive items for adcs that don’t cause their damage to fall off a cliff.   The only real downside I see to this is that yasuo and yone might have their winrate slip slightly and riot may decide to respond to that by making a third yasuo.
rbo6x4,hnpajbh,hnpajbh,The real problem with ADCs,Natural-Ganache4565,12/08/2021,3,Imo you should only buy defense items when youre ahead.  If you enemy is fed armor or mr isnt gonna do anything. But if youre ahead the extra armor and Mr will let you have a lot more sustain than your opponent
rbo6x4,hnpd61e,hnpd61e,The real problem with ADCs,ConscienceNot,12/08/2021,3,You make it sound as if the problem with adcs is champs like yasuo are outclassing them in being adc which really isnt or that their items are kept underpowered which isnt true at all. In fact crit items are the best in the game.
rbo6x4,hnpawcp,hnpawcp,The real problem with ADCs,Angry---train,12/08/2021,2,The melee crit users are specifically designed around building crit and are given those tools because theyd instantaneously die without them. Either way most meta marksmen are 10 times stronger than them so arbitrarily nerfing crit items for melees who were designed to use them is mind numingly stupid
rbo6x4,hnq7rjw,hnq7rjw,The real problem with ADCs,ChemicalSpray7768,12/08/2021,1,the entire problem with ADC is that supports are just too broken right now. nerf supp so the whole lane is not decided by who gets better support and ADC instantly becomes good role again.
rbo6x4,hnpa7ov,hnpa7ov,The real problem with ADCs,Pur1tas,12/08/2021,0,Pretty sure ranged ADCs arent supposed to get defensive items. Their range is their defensive item essentially no?
rbo6x4,hnpd2zp,hnpd2zp,The real problem with ADCs,gigZ2g,12/08/2021,0,Your post would get more interest if you would stop using stupid wording. Yasuo 1 and 2 riot would make a third yasuo. Doesnt sound like a serious post.
rbo6x4,hnph1kj,hnph1kj,The real problem with ADCs,LOLCraze,12/08/2021,0,Is Shieldbow not a defensive item? Is Galeforce not a mobility item? Theres wits end. Maw is kinda bad maybe they can rework it.   ADCs arent bad. You are just misunderstanding the nature of the role.
rbo6x4,hnpusbo,hnpusbo,The real problem with ADCs,ColdFire252,12/08/2021,1,“Designed around building crit”  Sure that’s why Viego has been building DS up until now and do you remember the reign of tank yasuo?? Yeah they wouldn’t fall apart but marksman would
rbo6x4,hnpbklr,hnpbklr,The real problem with ADCs,WantToDie78,12/08/2021,6,That would be true if 1/6 assassins couldn’t close that gap and kill you in the time it takes you to make 2 auto attacks
rbo6x4,hnprs5d,hnprs5d,The real problem with ADCs,WantToDie78,12/08/2021,2,Wit’s end doesn’t give crit so if you take it second your damage is ruined and if you take it after IE it comes up too late for it to be relevant.  Shieldbow isn’t taken on most adcs since they still get oneshot through the shield and it’s abused way better by the melee champs that use it which is the point of my post.  Galeforce is a short range dash on a 90 second cooldown. Calling it mobility is a joke.  If the ‘nature’ of ADCs is being unable to 1v1 the 1/4 assassin when you’re 2/0 then the role is a mess and needs to be reworked
rbo6x4,hnpcxr1,hnpcxr1,The real problem with ADCs,Pur1tas,12/08/2021,1,I dont disagree its probably the hardest micro needed in this game to keep your distance properly and dodge skillshots while still dishing out DPS but whenever you DO manage to pull it off you melt everyone pretty fast.   I think thats kind of a fair payoff especially as when we talk about balance we have to look at whats optimally possible not whats happening in games if you know what I mean. An ADC not playing perfectly isnt a balance issue but a missplay to a degree. ADCs are very hard and unforgiving but insanely strong when played to perfection. That obviously kinda sucks for a big portion of players but luckily everyone else also plays far from perfect so it kinda evens out.   That still means ADCs are the hardest class of champions to play.
rbo6x4,hnpfwcp,hnpfwcp,The real problem with ADCs,-Quit,12/08/2021,1,Assassins cant do that when they are behind. You are playing the wrong game and assassins are not the strongest class in the game like you are making seem to be. Heck they are not even the strongest class in their own lane.
rbo6x4,hnpv50l,hnpv50l,The real problem with ADCs,ColdFire252,12/08/2021,1,That’s the whole issue with the game assassins are meant to kill adcs and squishy mages it’s their fucking job but what is utilized in pro play that isn’t in solo q is the fact that supports peel the assassins off of them exception is qiyana that champ is bullshit and deserves removal
rbo6x4,hnq4hrn,hnq4hrn,The real problem with ADCs,LOLCraze,12/08/2021,1,The role of an assassin is to kill carries. A 1/4 assassin can kill a 2/0 ADC because ADC mispositioned mistimed his lifesaving spell(s) his team did not peel for him or the carry facechecks without vision/with incomplete vision.   I dont know why you think 90s CDs arent enough. Objectives only come up every 5 mins. You can participate in 2/3 fights within the 5 mins and be able to use galeforce.

rbnu9a,hnp9fwl,hnp9fwl,Is Yorick the most useless champion in league right now?,Nubi_Princess,12/08/2021,2,Seems like your playing not to his strength.  Try to watch sir chez ( or whatever he’s spelled). He plays different styles of yorick like Tank or full lethality.
rbnu9a,hnpa9t4,hnpa9t4,Is Yorick the most useless champion in league right now?,LittleJenkins1,12/08/2021,2,I mean I would argue you may be playing him wrong. His Strength as a split pusher is insanity especially with Hullbreakers. Yes Laning he has fallen off as like you said E is predicable W is easy to get out of for a few champs but late game split pushing its a nightmare.   If the Enemy team leaves you alone you OWN that lane. Everything will fall to a Yorik with Hullbreakers. Though if they come after you then your team can fight either a divided team and pick them off or take other objectives. He is far from useless.

rbnu9a,hnpei4y,hnpei4y,Is Yorick the most useless champion in league right now?,brokerZIP,12/08/2021,1,Hes not ideal but hes good enough. His damage is kind of insane. Flat amounts of physical DMG through ghouls (combined with seryldas/cleaver) and sheen mythic. Percentage magic damage on E and R. You cant really build defensive against him. He scales decently. Worse than Jax or Nasus or Camille but still has not the last scaling power. He shreds both squishies and tanks. He has good mobility if he lands E (and good Yorick will always do). And of course pushing. He can double split with maiden.
rbnu9a,hnprs38,hnprs38,Is Yorick the most useless champion in league right now?,MrTortaFrita,12/08/2021,1,Yorick is split push machine and I despise how toxic his playstyle is

rbnqta,rbnqta,rbnqta,Subtle detail in Episode 3 of Arcane,ProjectKaycee,12/08/2021,0,I dont know if anyone mentioned this (I searched and didnt find) but theres a detail in Episode 3 that just makes a particular scene much more impactful. After Marcus betrayal hes given a bag of coins and tosses it to the ground. This can be mirrored to Judas betrayal in the bible where he feels immense guilt for his betrayal and wants nothing to do with the coins throwing it to the ground but alas its too late. The deed has been done. And since this betrayal basically triggers the events of Arcane its even sadder because unlike in the bible theres no salvation here.
rbnqta,hnpbxah,hnpbxah,Subtle detail in Episode 3 of Arcane,AngryBlitzcrankMain,12/08/2021,2,I swear to god reading dozens of post of people who have seemingly never consumed anything but Arcane made me dumber.

rbnplj,rbnplj,rbnplj,Riot nerfed Prestige Point Shop and Event Loot systems BUT lets mention how lot's of champions got a Legendary or secondary Legendary skin but Fiddlesticks haven't got a single skin for 3 years!,Kordben,12/08/2021,0,TLDR at the end.  Fiddlesticks havent recevied a new skin for 1125 days while Mundo is close second with 1097 days.  Aatrox Alistar Amumu Aphelos Aurelion Sol Dr Mundo Elise Ezreal Fiddlesticks Fizz Gangplank Hecarim Heimerdinger Illaoi Jayce Jinx Kassadin KhaZix Kindred Lee Sin Lissandra Nocturne Orianna Ryze Shen Singed Skarner Taliyah Taric Teemo Tristana Trundle Udyr Urgot Vi Viktor Zac Ziggs Zilean Zoe.  This is 40 champions. Not Including Arcane skins then 36 (Feels like more of a promotion but still I had to mentioon it). 34 if Im not counting Lunar Beast Alistar/Aphelios  Also there are 8 champions who havent recevied a skin for 362 days.  There are 11 other champions who havent recevied any new skins in 300+days.  Here are the list of champions who recevied 2 or more skins this year (I did not counted those skins which got prestige version in the same time as they got released except Leona for she got 4 skins in total this year) :   Darius (Lunar Beast+Crime City)   Draven (Ruined+Debonair)   Leona (Debonair+Battle Academy+1PR+DWG)   Zed (PROJECT PR+Debonair Legendary)   Caitlyn (Battle Academy Legendary+Arcane)   Malzahar (Beezahar+Debonair)   Karma (Ruined+Dragon)   Thresh (Unbound+Iron Dragon)   Yasuo (2Legendary Truth/Dream dragon)   Syndra (Withered Rose+Bewitching)   Kayle (Dragonslayer+Pentakill)   Mordekaiser (PROJECT+Pentakill)   Morgana (Bewitching PR+Dawnbringer)   Olaf (Sentinel+Pentakill)   Yone (Battle Academy+Dawnbringer)   Yuumi (Beemi+Bewitching)  This leaves us with 75 Legendary skins. 6 is unavailable for purchase so from this 69 skins 23 belongs to the same 11 champions:   Pulsefire Caitlyn/Battle Academy Caitlyn   Storm Dragon Lee Sin/God Fist Lee Sin    Spirit Blossom Ahri/Star Guardian Ahri    God King Darius/Dunkmaster Darius    High Noon Ashe/ Project Ashe   Nightbringer Soraka/Dawnbringer Soraka    Nightbringer Yasuo /Truth Dragon Yasuo/Dream Dragon Yasuo    Galaxy Slayer Zed/Debonair Zed    Project Vayne/Sentinel Vayne    Solar Eclipse Leona/Lunar Eclipse Leona    Cho Gath(Gentleman+Battlecast Prime)  Riot did promised to deliver 140 skins this year and while there is like 40+- champ who had not recevied any skins seems like too high a number if you ask me WHEN leona got 2 regular skins a prestige skin and a DWG skin or yone getting both a legendary skin and an 1350 rp skin or cait getting a second legendary and ASU to all of her skins.  Skin quality went down skin quantity went up. There are way more champions in specific skinline that just doesnt fit there but it seems like there is a Quota that they needs to fill. Like the crime city skin line wher Darius Akali Zyra TF feels really strange. Coven universe skins feels the same somewhat. I mean Ashe and Ahri feels forced into that skinline while every other champ is a huge success.  Then we have the interesting Firelight Ekko case.    Its a fucking experiment if they can lower the quality to 975 RP of the skin while still sell like an 1350 RP which is a huge shame. If that sells well then more skin like that will come which is a shame cuz Riot has no competition literally.    Imagine like how Blizzard crumbled itself could happen here. With the success of Arcane it would be good for Riot to keep the image of that good company but if they are getting way too greedy they gona fall just like that. Especyally because...Mmo is in production.  TLDR: Riot released a lot of skins but actual champ diversity in skins releases did not go up in fact a lot of potential got wasted. But hey at least plenty of champs got their second Legendary skin I guess. If FireLight Ekko gets releases in its current version it will mean that they also reducing the amount of work put into skins but not their price tags while a lot more champion will get into the 1000+ days without skins.

So what if fiddle gets a new skin? He has such a small playerbase compared to other champs that even if its the greatest league skin ever made or wont make them money. They are a businessand at the end of the day they are gonna act like it.
rbnplj,hnpssha,hnpssha,Riot nerfed Prestige Point Shop and Event Loot systems BUT lets mention how lot's of champions got a Legendary or secondary Legendary skin but Fiddlesticks haven't got a single skin for 3 years!,MrTortaFrita,12/08/2021,0,I dont get this post you mention a lot of champs that have a ton of skins (Ezreal Alistar Jinx Lee Sin Ziggs etc) and why should a champ get a skin every year? Others on the list got one at the end of last year.   Yes champs that didnt get a skin in 1000+ days SHOULD get a skin but remember skins are a business. Obviously Yasuo is going to get more legendary skins than Ivern the playerbase disparity is massive. Champs being popular may be the most important factor in determining what skins they get.

rbnnui,rbnnui,rbnnui,I have never seen so many complaints about a game which mostly works fine on a subreddit,NOWAY_YESWAY,12/08/2021,0,League of legends is the most popular game in the world and Riot is one of the major game companies right now but the players is the most negative in the entire world. As soon as riot releases a new thing be it a skin or game mode or a patch players quickly find the worst thing about it and make a big post about it here.  Riot releases a skin for Ekko from Arcane and The only comments about it is mask toggle or we riot? Or that its more expensive than other skins? Why can people never be happy about anything? There are so many complaints about the game when there defintely are more good things about it. So many spoiled brats in this subreddit and I just had to vent for once myself alittle hypocritical but I really needed to write this because every day I read about things that doesnt matter at all but people need perfection from a company that has thousands of employes.  Sry for the english and have a good day of games.
rbnnui,hnpbxqu,hnpbxqu,I have never seen so many complaints about a game which mostly works fine on a subreddit,GrizzlySin24,12/08/2021,15,Pretty easy Riot is a Multibilliondollar Multinational cooperation not your friend.. If I don’t like their product(skins) I the customer have the right to complain. To stick with your example of the Ekko skin questions like why wasn’t he part of the arcane quests or why isn’t he wearing the mask and using the Hoverboard he had for 90% of the show are good and justified questions to ask.  TLDR: They are just a faceless cooperation complaining about them their behavior and/or their products is always justified(if it is reasonable ofc)
rbnnui,hnp8yr1,hnp8yr1,I have never seen so many complaints about a game which mostly works fine on a subreddit,korksel,12/08/2021,8,Problem is people have experienced many different metas. Everyone has the personal favorite meta but to stay relevant the game has to evolve which basically means to go away from the good old times.  People in general just like to complain it is how it is
rbnnui,hnpahxz,hnpahxz,I have never seen so many complaints about a game which mostly works fine on a subreddit,TheAlpaka,12/08/2021,6,Well the game is really buggy. I think that there is at least one noticeable bug in every game some of them gamebreaking. Also the launcher is not really working. 50% of the time.i try to do something in my loot it doesnt work. Or it freezes my pc after game or the whole client is black or you cant see your friendlist...i cant remember a day without an annoying bug just in the launcher.  I could accept it if this was a small company but it is one of the biggest in the world

They are doing what Blizzard and Valve failed to do.
rbnnui,hnp8dh5,hnp8dh5,I have never seen so many complaints about a game which mostly works fine on a subreddit,TheUnit70,12/08/2021,8,Agreed. The league community does nothing better than complaining. Its our #1 skill.
rbnnui,hnp8ap6,hnp8ap6,I have never seen so many complaints about a game which mostly works fine on a subreddit,DR-Fluffy,12/08/2021,4,When you really enjoy something be it the gameplay or the lore only to have the devs shit all over it you start having some complaints.  Me personally I dont do a lot of complaining. I just try and keep a record of everyone on the balance team so when they die I can go and piss on their graves.
rbnnui,hnpaya9,hnpaya9,I have never seen so many complaints about a game which mostly works fine on a subreddit,Fictitious1267,12/08/2021,3,These guys make close to 2 billion a year and have a client worse than many games with less than 100k income. Can we stop making excuses for them? They deserve to be called out for most of the mess they get in including the champ design including the client including the extremely lazy preseason changes including horrible balance decisions.  We are customers not consumers. If were collectively making them filthy rich we should be entitled to a highly functioning game and not some mess that feels like a beta on a daily basis.
rbnnui,hnp9p50,hnp9p50,I have never seen so many complaints about a game which mostly works fine on a subreddit,fishwallet16,12/08/2021,2,yeah no shit people are complaining. can you imagine if tekken 7 released spiderman but all he does is punches and doesnt even use fucking webs?   riot did a bare minimum job for this skin that had an iconic mask and hoverboard design and its barely used even though everyone knows theres a toggle option for skin
rbnnui,hnp854h,hnp854h,I have never seen so many complaints about a game which mostly works fine on a subreddit,Far-Abroad8185,12/08/2021,-1,Lol you have the mentality of a slave.
rbnnui,hnp8k7t,hnp8k7t,I have never seen so many complaints about a game which mostly works fine on a subreddit,Pur1tas,12/08/2021,1,Its several things that play together here.  1. Its as you said the most popular game in the world (probably) which creates a HUGE playerbase. This means that chances someone dislikes something are very very high. 2. Reddit and other forums are echo chambers and what you hear from them (as in the posts people make) are EXTREME opinions always. For 100 people happy with the game maybe 1 will make a post for 100 people unhappy a lot more will make a post. So what you FEEL as the community opinion is actually just a loud few.
rbnnui,hnpds19,hnpds19,I have never seen so many complaints about a game which mostly works fine on a subreddit,LOLCraze,12/08/2021,1,People were complaining about skins? Must be those new players. Im pretty sure most of us oldies are so weathered that we only talk about the balancing of the game.

rbnnui,hnpejfw,hnpejfw,I have never seen so many complaints about a game which mostly works fine on a subreddit,ConscienceNot,12/08/2021,1,Well the thing is that Riot commits to china and even aside that they still arent perfect so yeah it makes sense they get flamed for misteps. If Riot does something correct we rejoice like in case of arcane and vex but if they do something borderline wrong we get pissed like in case of ruination event or yuumi or viego or yone or chemtech or elder buff or item diversity. You see that? Amount of bad things heavily outweight amount of good things they do.  If Riot did the same job back as now then there would be way less players. At start the game had its own issues because it was new but at the same time there was much more freedom for what is fun and the genuinelly bad things got addressed but now there are only implemented things that are nothing but frustrating and they do that completely willingly which is what makes u hate. There are bugs like in past but bugs arent intended so there is no reason to hate riot for it ( if it doesnt get out of hand or get ignored ). Also **we arent even complaining that its bad but that its getting worse.** With that said community might have gotten higher level of standards.

rbnnui,hnq8ssh,hnq8ssh,I have never seen so many complaints about a game which mostly works fine on a subreddit,Pure_Void,12/08/2021,1,man why do ppl keep talking bout how much ppl complain like who tf cares let ppl vent and half of it is justified like the ekko like how are u soo blindsided that u dont see that it isnt just about a mask its about how the price doesnt match what ur paying for like if ppl did what u wanted  we wouldnt see change and would open the doors for riot to scam tf out of us since they wouldnt get any backlash and theres legit thousands of users in this reddit so if 1 person post about a particular thing another might not see it and post bout it too.
rbnnui,hnq9bau,hnq9bau,I have never seen so many complaints about a game which mostly works fine on a subreddit,throwawaynumber116,12/08/2021,1,I sink money and more importantly time into League of Legends. If they do something stupid that impacts my experience of course I have the right to complain.   League won’t be number 1 for long if we as consumers let Riot get lazy with their product. LoL doesn’t have any real competition (other mobas like dota/smite just aren’t big enough) so the only pressure they get is from their own players. Imagine if there were a similarly huge mobas that actually had a client or map skins. Riot would lose money just from people leaving.  Us complaining is far better then the alternative which is letting riot get complacent and worsen the game over time.
rbnnui,hnq9f1g,hnq9f1g,I have never seen so many complaints about a game which mostly works fine on a subreddit,AdvanceHandball,12/08/2021,1,Every complaint is actually someone begging Riot to change the game in the way they want.

Yes the client is not the best (hell I think its bad) and balance is somewhat off but I personally cant agree with the fact that bugs and the like are an everyday experience.

rbnnui,hnpdr2q,hnpdr2q,I have never seen so many complaints about a game which mostly works fine on a subreddit,Sateless,12/08/2021,1,Why would I waste my time posting on reddit about what riot does right and what I enjoy if u can do that by simply playing and buying skins. Reddit is the only avenue for people to talk about how they feel about the state of the game. It used to be the league forums instead of reddit. The most passionate people are the ones that are willing to give criticism about what they like when they feel strongly. Most people also give riot a hard time because we know they have the resources to do better. If you played the game since release you would expect the client to operate as it should.

One is called antiwork and its people applauding walking out on jobs etc. Reddit is full of whiny lazy self-entitled babies.
rbnnui,hnqrgos,hnqrgos,I have never seen so many complaints about a game which mostly works fine on a subreddit,Blue_Seraph,12/08/2021,1,Thats the thing. More popular = more complaints. As a company grows in popularity it generally has to get more and more distant to its playerbase while the playerbase gets increasingly more diverse. In a small community catering to your niche is easy so making people feel like they are catered to is easy hence lesser complaints. In a big community theres more chances to have someone feel left out more ways someone can feel left out and chances are people have been there to see the company grow and are already engaged in the content more intensely --> more intense negative reactions.   But then you also need to acknowledge that the positive reactions when they happen are also super intense. I mean look at how much people are positively engaging with the pro season ( and offseason too) discussing matches rosters and bantering around.   Heck look at the Arcane Hype too. We might be a bunch of cranky people but we do hype the good things a whole lot too.

rbnnui,hnqrou8,hnqrou8,I have never seen so many complaints about a game which mostly works fine on a subreddit,HahnImWahn,12/08/2021,1,watch some replay of blitzcrank hooks that dont hit optically but hit according to the game. that means hitboxes are calculated wrong which in fact is a bug.  edit: also why do you downvote me only because i know what i’m talking as im a programmer myself.
rbnnui,hnqryss,hnqryss,I have never seen so many complaints about a game which mostly works fine on a subreddit,gaom9706,12/08/2021,1,Thats not a bug or more specifically anything wrong with the code. Thats just shitty animation and hitboxes

I never said that  >whats it called when not bug?  Shitty animation. The hit box doesnt line up with the animation being displayed. Nothings wrong with the code of the game the animation just poorly communicates the area of effect. That doesnt mean its ok (nessecarily) its fucked when it happens but thats irrelevant as to whether or not its a BUG.
rbnnui,hnqtgpp,hnqtgpp,I have never seen so many complaints about a game which mostly works fine on a subreddit,HahnImWahn,12/08/2021,1,maybe look up blitzcrank hook bug on youtube. its from six years ago and still the same.   nothing is wrong with the code of a game when it delivers wrong positions and results? it just doesn’t make sense to discuss with you as you clearly have no clue of programming.   just stick with your opinion and keep downvoting me because you don’t wanna accept that your holy game does have bugs.   i love lol but those hitbox bugs are annoying.

I can get you a ladder to stand on since youre reaching so much.   Like holy shit you say I dont know anything about programming but youre the one calling weird hitboxes a bug. The hook is working as intended but the animation isnt lining up 100% correctly with the hitbox. Thats an animation error not a bug. I dont know how else to say this. Jesus can we get a rioter in here or something?

rbnhv0,rbnhv0,rbnhv0,Ok so what's the deal with Jinx & Vi being sisters?,DND2000,12/08/2021,0,Ok I get that Jinx and Vi are sisters and I remember people had said that ages ago way before Arcane but is Arcane our first official confirmation of this or was there something else?  I know apparently there was a deleted Riot tweet that confirmed it around Jinxs release and apparently ut was deleted cause it wasnt canon or something.  I apso know apparently Ghostcrawler confirmed it at somepoint.  Basically when did we get actual canon lore on this official or was it canon then retconned out? Then changed back?
rbnhv0,hnp70z5,hnp70z5,Ok so what's the deal with Jinx & Vi being sisters?,czartaylor,12/08/2021,7,its always been heavily hinted (since release) but never confirmed. Its now confirmed.
rbnhv0,hnpesok,hnpesok,Ok so what's the deal with Jinx & Vi being sisters?,bornhat,12/08/2021,1,It was only ever hinted.  Only thing I remember being retconned is back then they said Jinx was older than Vi
rbnhv0,hnprmxk,hnprmxk,Ok so what's the deal with Jinx & Vi being sisters?,Roseking,12/08/2021,1,Ghostcrawler did say in an interview that they were sisters. However after that interview he said it was just such a common theory he believed it was true and was never told it wasnt.   > So funny story. >  > You may recall that I started at at Riot not long after the Jinx launch. At the time all the players assumed they were sisters. I had no insider knowledge at the time. >  > Since then I am almost positive that I havent been in a meeting at Riot where anyone ever said that Riot hasnt officially confirmed or denied their relationship. So I went right on believing it. >  > Also funny story I also manage the narrative team for LoL. >  > Anyway Zak (the interviewer) is a super nice guy and has great English but told me he was slightly out of touch with League or at least our lore so I thought he was just confused. >  > Turns out I was confused. >  > So the official answer from Riot is that Vi and Jinxs relationship is unresolved.

rbnhv0,hnp9h60,hnp9h60,Ok so what's the deal with Jinx & Vi being sisters?,ApplePitou,12/08/2021,0,Before the release of Arcane there were many hints and guesses that Vi/Jinx are sisters and now after Arcane show up it has been confirmed :3

rbnhv0,hnpthgf,hnpthgf,Ok so what's the deal with Jinx & Vi being sisters?,DND2000,12/08/2021,1,Yeah I get that but this is more so a question about if the lore has changed over time in regards to Jinx & Vi being Sisters.   Or in other words more so about the history of the lore being changed than the story that the lore tells.
rbnfy2,rbnfy2,rbnfy2,Gamemode where we can play pre-rework champs,cyrekko,12/08/2021,0,I dont know if this has been suggested before or if something like this is planned but Id love to see a game mode where we can play champions with their pre-rework abilities. Ill be honest I just want to play old irelia again but I think itd be cool to see. Also there is a joke to be made about which version of Ryze to use but thats a low hanging fruit
rbnfy2,hnp6th8,hnp6th8,Gamemode where we can play pre-rework champs,Pur1tas,12/08/2021,5,I dont think it will ever happen. Bringing back things that were removed essentially seems like a lot of work for very little profit. And after all this is about making money for riot.

rbnfy2,hnpi3s5,hnpi3s5,Gamemode where we can play pre-rework champs,nuuudy,12/08/2021,1,seems like a lot of work for very little profit. Besides do we really wanna go back to AP Yi or Madreds Warwick? say all you want about new releases but they are not half as broken as many pre rework champions  also 85% tenacity Irelia with 75 true damage extra autoattacks was very fun (for Irelia only but hey it was fun!)
rbnfy2,hnpt0g7,hnpt0g7,Gamemode where we can play pre-rework champs,MrTortaFrita,12/08/2021,1,Riot said its not that easy. They dont keep old champion files in the game to get them back they would have to re-do them again or something
rbnfy2,hnp8cjc,hnp8cjc,Gamemode where we can play pre-rework champs,Greigsyy,12/08/2021,1,Didn’t they do this with items on the rotational game modes like nexus blitz when it first started? I.e bring back items that used to be in the game but was removed.  EDIT: I see from comment below they’ve looked into it but was just asking as I’m sure they’ve done the same with items.
rbnfy2,hnp8nk5,hnp8nk5,Gamemode where we can play pre-rework champs,Pur1tas,12/08/2021,2,I would argue an item (especially ones with ... say little interactivity in terms of what they need to do on the map) is much easier to bring back than a champion.
rbnfy2,hnpa06d,hnpa06d,Gamemode where we can play pre-rework champs,Greigsyy,12/08/2021,1,I do agree with this as riot have said it’d be far too much work to get it coded in was just wondering about the removed items being added in as i imagine it is indeed a million times easier to code in basically just multipliers rather than full as champs with old kits ect.

rbmseo,hnp8xtk,hnp8xtk,Teleport change in PBE,Mornos,12/08/2021,808,I really hate it when they try to solve problems by introducing such niche mechanics. Why cant everything function in a uniform way? Mid and Top tower have extra armor early bot doesnt. Minions always give the same amount for gold except for midlane and I believe even that is time gated. One team receives stronger minions if the difference in levels is great enough. First scuttle has reduced rewards all the other ones are the same.   Just so many bullshit mechanics you need to look up and learn because riot cant find a sensible way to balance things.  EDIT: because some people have replied with new mechanics here is a list:  1. first minion wave is ghosted so it does not collide with champs 2. mid lane minions gold is reduced by 10 for the first 14 minutes of the game 3. Only top and mid tower have extra armor for the first 4 minutes I believe 4. Towers gain extra armor for every enemy champ near them.  5. Minions move faster and have more attack dmg depending on the level difference between teams 6. If a champ with smite kills too many lane minions before minute 20 he is hit with a gold and exp penalty for minions.  7. First crab of the games rewards reduced xp and gold. 8. Turrets gain extra resists when their health goes below certain thresholds. 9. Ranged champs deal 17% less dmg to turrets while they have plates.  Im sure I missed a lot of niche mechanics so I will just add them. Players can gain info about some of these mechanics by reading ingame stuff but if one is not hit on the nose with it you wont look for it. So most of this stuff just stays hidden to most players.
rbmseo,hnq3edf,hnq3edf,Teleport change in PBE,JeanBonjambon,12/08/2021,1,Good. Cant wait they delete jungle role and put huge walls between all lanes so i can finally play with my brain off.
rbmseo,hnpd62n,hnpd62n,Teleport change in PBE,TheWarmog,12/08/2021,193,So.   1) can no longer impact the map for 14 minutes that also means that you cant even go b and tp back to contest herald or dragon.   2) Can no longer force lane freezes by tping on creeps     3) Welcome to ignite top i hope people are ready to welcome your s3 overlords in ignite ghost tryndamere and flash ignite jax + many more.
rbmseo,hnpbs6p,hnpbs6p,Teleport change in PBE,PhantomRager,12/08/2021,210,I am a top lane player and I dont like this change. Finding the right time to tp botlane takes skill. You cant just tp bot lane because if you get nothing the enemy can get 2 free waves and at least one plating or also tp bot. Its not like you can tp bot lane for free and the enemy top gains nothing.  But I see why they changed it. I have been flamed too many times by random botlanes because their top managed to tp botlane and I decided to go for 4 plates.
rbmseo,hnpauaz,hnpauaz,Teleport change in PBE,barryh4rry,12/08/2021,7,i havent seen anyone say this but something that is changed by this is tping to hold a freeze whether its the enemy laner trying to push out the wave or its just slow pushing towards you after you’ve based or roamed this one tp can decide an entire laning phase and punishes poor wave management
rbmseo,hnp9olb,hnp9olb,Teleport change in PBE,00Dandy,12/08/2021,95,Please no. This just removes so much potential playmaking in the early game. TP plays are already very risky anyway.
rbmseo,hnp6f2o,hnp6f2o,Teleport change in PBE,OverZedlous,12/08/2021,93,this buffs botlane.  Katarina no more tp bot last hit 2-3 kills for 900 gold and 6 dark seal stacks!
rbmseo,hnpa4ux,hnpa4ux,Teleport change in PBE,barryh4rry,12/08/2021,99,people complaining about top/mid tping bot never sweep for bush control nor do they respect the possibility of a tp flank  im even saying this as someone who holds tp and perma plays for myself but you should be playing around tp like you would play around any other summoner spell if you’re being tp’d on while pushed up under the enemy tower then you are overextending without properly setting up/clearing vision
rbmseo,hnpbwby,hnpbwby,Teleport change in PBE,DC_Flint,12/08/2021,130,Besides teleporting bot   what you can teleport on _toplane_ makes a massive difference.   Tping on a pushing wave after a base to push an advantage teleporting behind someone overstaying after a trade / kill teleporting on the last living minion of a wave to create / force a freeze after a base instead getting shoved into the tower and get a bouncing wave are all hugely influential use cases of teleport and this change will remove all of them.  It actually makes top less skill reliant than it already is all so botlane doesnt have to properly play a vision game or play around _other lanes cooldowns_.

rbmseo,hnp7g9h,hnp7g9h,Teleport change in PBE,VindicoAtrum,12/08/2021,81,I get it though. +2 levels mid/tops teleporting to wards bot for double kills is killing gameplay in bot lane in favour of playing safer than ever before and not handing out two kills and four assists.
rbmseo,hnp4dbp,hnp4dbp,Teleport change in PBE,wenasi,12/08/2021,22,Considering I rarely see early minion flank tps in low Plat and below its probably not going to change much for most people.  But damn its big for competitive (and probably high elo?)

I should be worried about top laners like Quinn Shen and Kled coming to beat my ass once they hit their level 6 as that is what they are designed to do. I shouldnt worry about a Wukong coming to my lane for a free Double Kill just because hes got solo exp and hit level 6 while Im still at 4.
rbmseo,hnpopr2,hnpopr2,Teleport change in PBE,2KWT,12/08/2021,13,Just another day of Riot fucking top lane.
rbmseo,hnpve7w,hnpve7w,Teleport change in PBE,DeleteAllWeebs,12/08/2021,3,So basically make top lane even less important than it already is since you cant tp to early drag fights.  I dont understand riot at all this preseason Lethal tempo change is the dumbest thing for top lane in years and now this.
rbmseo,hnpicuz,hnpicuz,Teleport change in PBE,Stage4TwitchChat,12/08/2021,20,Lets make the game even more bot focused because top laners can gank on a 6.30 minute cd and a price of 2 plates+ 2 waves.  Dont look at supports and junglers btw nothing wrong there
rbmseo,hnp9v5t,hnp9v5t,Teleport change in PBE,Radiant_Shelter688,12/08/2021,67,So as a toplaner when your botlane is losing you just shut up and lose the game ? Nice. Nevermind rewarding good supports who manage to ward deep and getting the enemy to push while the toplaner carefully managed the wave so as not to lose lane advantage.  If you complain about a toplaner tping into botlane then:  \-Monitor enemys summs.  \-Dont push with enemys TP up.  \-If for some reason your lane is still pushed sweep bushes.
rbmseo,hnpq31w,hnpq31w,Teleport change in PBE,Ketokeja,12/08/2021,11,tp/ignite Kat/akali you wont be missed not putting 0 effort in lane macro at all just to tp flank botlane to become relevant. The playstyle is so toxic for laners playing against them.
rbmseo,hnp3yam,hnp3yam,Teleport change in PBE,czartaylor,12/08/2021,21,ehhhhhhhh  I mean it makes sense that you nerf tp given that despite riot piling on nerfs for 3+ seasons its still the best summoner not named flash but at the same time this kind of fucks over pretty much every use case of TP besides tping back to lane or onto a tower to prevent a dive (which isnt really the most healthy use case of TP right now if were being honest)  removing it from champion related terrain is something that probably should have happened a while back but minions and maybe wards? no. The most logical place to start is by removing it from just champion created objects and wards if youre feeling frisky and then moving onto minions if it keeps being a problem.   Also an indirect but massive nerf to top lane.
rbmseo,hnp43e9,hnp43e9,Teleport change in PBE,screwmystepmom,12/08/2021,74,Hmmm.   Well I already felt useless as a toplaner. I didnt think I could feel even more useless.   Its a shame cause Im a big roamer for my playstyle. I give up farm to roam mid/bot early multiple times.   Seems I cant do that anymore. Sigh.
rbmseo,hnp53bv,hnp53bv,Teleport change in PBE,gangplank_main1,12/08/2021,39,top lane agency is getting lowered even more?
rbmseo,hnp6sgj,hnp6sgj,Teleport change in PBE,oioioi9537,12/08/2021,38,Hot take i like this change because bot lane is a 5v5/4v4 fiesta at like 7 minutes. Im not even a adc/sup main but i feel like idk bot lane should be allowed to lane instead of lvl 6 solo laners tping behind them when theyre level 4. You can still use tp to prevent dives so i dont think its as bad as people think it will be
rbmseo,hnp80yg,hnp80yg,Teleport change in PBE,Jozoz,12/08/2021,41,Potentially hot take: This is a great change and sorely needed for pro play. Might have poor effects on solo queue though but I guess that can be fixed in other ways.  **Heres why I think this change is needed:**  We have reached a point in pro play where teleport is more game-influencing than flash. That is absolutely insane. Individual skill is being hampered A LOT by it. You cant ever go for a solo kill in lane without getting mass teleported on. Almost every skirmish ends up becoming a 4v4 or 5v5.   Every game in pro play mid and top laners will have TP. In the past we even saw ADCs also take it very often. We need more actual choices in summoner spells. Whens the last time you saw someone take ignite mid unless on very specific champions? In the past you saw a wide variety of summoners in mid lane. Ignite ghost cleanse exhaust tp whatever. Now its just 99% of the time TP.  They have nerfed and changed TP over time but it hasnt really fixed the core issue. I 100% agree with their decision to majorly overhaul TP but I know it will be controversial. Kudos to Riot for having the balls. (now remove stopwatch next)
rbmseo,hnpi1tr,hnpi1tr,Teleport change in PBE,TheNotCoolKid,12/08/2021,5,Kennen players in shambles right now
rbmseo,hnpovpx,hnpovpx,Teleport change in PBE,winniepuuhtin,12/08/2021,4,Reasoning: Top lane has way to much influence to the game.   Now u can´t TP gank anymore and have to stay top for the first 14min of the game (pretty much >50% of the whole game time).
rbmseo,hnp90yv,hnp90yv,Teleport change in PBE,dil3ttante,12/08/2021,23,Great change for pro play. Skillful 1v1 2v2s were being crowded out / discouraged by everyone and their mother tping the moment a trade goes bad / someone gets engaged on.  Teleport gimps/punishes aggression around the map so hopefully we’ll get to see winning bot lanes harassing enemies under tower and the same for mid as well.   Also huge indirect jhin nidalee buffs. Using traps to skillfully coordinate tp flank will be cool to watch.
rbmseo,hnpg4ln,hnpg4ln,Teleport change in PBE,Nicksiss,12/08/2021,7,stupid change
rbmseo,hnpcs61,hnpcs61,Teleport change in PBE,gellatomato,12/08/2021,21,Yes lets take away the 5% of influence Top Laners have on the game by removing the only thing that gives them access to the map. Top Lane is an Island. This is also another indirect buff to my main Shen. They need to revert his last Ult buffs.
rbmseo,hnpcjil,hnpcjil,Teleport change in PBE,NurseTaric,12/08/2021,19,Riot just hates skill expression huh
rbmseo,hnpg6yb,hnpg6yb,Teleport change in PBE,-M-Morningstar,12/08/2021,9,yeah let’s reduce skill expression and the ability for top laners to impact the rest of the map.
rbmseo,hnpo78d,hnpo78d,Teleport change in PBE,AalfredWilibrordius,12/08/2021,4,This affects mid lane TP users much more than top lane TP users as a mid laner its much easier to find timings where youve shoved the wave and can tp to a side lane for a gank because its much easier to get back to mid in time + mid laners can usually clear waves faster and easier without their opponents freezing.   Plus mid laners have two long lanes they can TP to as opposed to top laners who cant really tp gank mid because its too short.
rbmseo,hnpadlb,hnpadlb,Teleport change in PBE,justPierre,12/08/2021,2,Its a buff to toplaner doing ego tp on a minion right after dying lvl3 to a gank they wont die a second time the same minute
rbmseo,hnpbhe3,hnpbhe3,Teleport change in PBE,Exterial,12/08/2021,2,as much as i hate tp katarina getting fed for 0 reason because my bot lane is braindead i do think its a big idea to remove the ability to tp gank early.
rbmseo,hnpjx3o,hnpjx3o,Teleport change in PBE,HawksBurst,12/08/2021,2,I missed the random TP changes. Everytime they try to reduce its presence it goes back to multiple per game after a while so I wouldnt celebrate too much.    But honestly this change just makes the game yet again easier as you dont have to worry about tps on the river/behind you before 14
rbmseo,hnpngto,hnpngto,Teleport change in PBE,Puuksu,12/08/2021,2,People wanted longer games. Here you go.
rbmseo,hnpqv6i,hnpqv6i,Teleport change in PBE,Falsus,12/08/2021,2,It will still be picked for lane since TP is really strong for lane on many champions. But that is such a good change for bot since you can finally play it without having to second guess every single thing you do because of TP.
rbmseo,hnprhho,hnprhho,Teleport change in PBE,scotthappytimes,12/08/2021,2,I feel like a sizable amount of the complaints to this change come from solo laners that have rarely if ever had someone tp to their lane while they were mid fight with their lane opponent.
rbmseo,hnpscev,hnpscev,Teleport change in PBE,Dalroy10,12/08/2021,2,Assassins who need to gank sidelane with tp like katarina are going to be hurt alot.  But... its not really a bad thing in my opinion !
rbmseo,hnpuato,hnpuato,Teleport change in PBE,Newfypuppie,12/08/2021,2,I do not enjoy this change removes a lot of strategic depth from the game. Perhaps remove tping to minions instead
rbmseo,hnpw2ls,hnpw2ls,Teleport change in PBE,MeLuvBlobsInnit,12/08/2021,2,Zac nerf
rbmseo,hnqar9z,hnqar9z,Teleport change in PBE,IcyPanda123,12/08/2021,1,As an ADC player thank you Riot Games
rbmseo,hnqed3p,hnqed3p,Teleport change in PBE,GGFrostKaiser,12/08/2021,1,This could have worked years ago when Top lane wasnt so counter pick heavy. But changes with the game throughout the years just made some matchups unplayable. There are only 2-3 meta top laners you can blind pick and even those can be countered by certain picks. By taking TP away you just make Top lane all about laning so getting counter picked makes it impossible.   They should just limit TP to only top lane like Smite for junglers if they want to limit playmaking around the map or something like that.
rbmseo,hnqfu4a,hnqfu4a,Teleport change in PBE,hot-hills-near-you,12/08/2021,1,I could not stand playing top lane anymore if this goes live. Counterpick was already degrading now whoever gets the counterpick essentially wins lane from select.  This just rewards botlane for trying stupid all-ins and punishes top lane for trying to help.
rbmseo,hnpa0bg,hnpa0bg,Teleport change in PBE,cantordubs,12/08/2021,5,stupid change early tps onto minions/wards are a skilful thing worth keeping in the game
rbmseo,hnpnq69,hnpnq69,Teleport change in PBE,Crosisx2,12/08/2021,6,Good sick of bot lane being 4v2.
rbmseo,hnp9qnh,hnp9qnh,Teleport change in PBE,colledeicorvi,12/08/2021,7,Ofc the toplane gets fucked :))))

rbmseo,hnpc6g6,hnpc6g6,Teleport change in PBE,Azafuse,12/08/2021,4,This looks great for the pro-scene botlane could be an actual lane again instead of the complete mess weve seen last few seasons.

rbmseo,hnpbmdb,hnpbmdb,Teleport change in PBE,viktor25fsh,12/08/2021,3,GG toplane
rbmseo,hnpirds,hnpirds,Teleport change in PBE,FearTHEReaper01,12/08/2021,2,As someone who only watches proplay good. I love this change.  I was legit starting to get sick of the usual strat of tping to bot in pro play that basically decides how the match up plays pre 14.  I wanna see botlane actually lane 2v2 for once without the constant worry of a tp play happening.  Im more excited about what happens to Bwipo now since his usual toplane play is find openings for a tp play at botlane early to autowin them the match up.
rbmseo,hnpk47z,hnpk47z,Teleport change in PBE,imLoges,12/08/2021,3,This seems like a change they should release at the beginning of preseason.  Classic fucking Riot they did this last year with jg exp and chemtank.
rbmseo,hnppqbt,hnppqbt,Teleport change in PBE,SercTCG,12/08/2021,2,huge buff to botlanes mental
rbmseo,hnpea9u,hnpea9u,Teleport change in PBE,BeepBoopAnv,12/08/2021,6,What the fuck is this?? At this point just say you can’t teleport below the dragon on the map because you can’t balance your game. How am I supposed to play a champion that doesn’t roam well vs champs that do. I already can’t follow them into the river and matching their play with TP was my only counterplay.   Absolutely boring zzzzz change. Bot lanes should have to play around other lanes cooldowns. If you can’t track it and brainlessly push without clearing minions or checking for lane wards you deserve to be punished. Bot lanes and strong roaming champions are strong enough as is
rbmseo,hnphg4u,hnphg4u,Teleport change in PBE,someone_3lse_,12/08/2021,2,Finally a nerf to Katarina
rbmseo,hnpradp,hnpradp,Teleport change in PBE,SupremeQuinn,12/08/2021,3,Great change. Teleport definitely needed to be curbed a bit.
rbmseo,hnp8oqe,hnp8oqe,Teleport change in PBE,ComfortableBite6644,12/08/2021,4,As a top I get it and I understand that TPs to bot lane as both mid and top behind the botlane was too much. However what about fucking supports running around the whole map with no punishment?
rbmseo,hnpbkus,hnpbkus,Teleport change in PBE,papu16,12/08/2021,3,Riot games : we know that toplane have huge problems with agency Toplaners : you gonna fix this problem right? Riot games : ... Toplaners : right?
rbmseo,hnp8nmd,hnp8nmd,Teleport change in PBE,MrPreviously,12/08/2021,2,I don’t think it’s that big of a change to nerf it early on early TPs are too much of a gamble if used on another lane.   Late game TP is actually buffed because it completes .5 seconds faster which can make a difference
rbmseo,hnp8hmj,hnp8hmj,Teleport change in PBE,asjdkasfkldsfs,12/08/2021,6,When will Riot learn that no matter how hard you suck off adc mains they will continue to whine. This just kills the only way for top to impact the map and adcs wont stop whining anyway.
rbmseo,hnp6hlm,hnp6hlm,Teleport change in PBE,TopMidAdcPlayer,12/08/2021,0,What a stupid change. Early TPs to bot arent even good right now.
rbmseo,hnpbc6k,hnpbc6k,Teleport change in PBE,chakacan,12/08/2021,2,This is a huge loss for proscene. There won’t be huge 5v5 fights happening in minute 10 early dives or huge flanks anymore but understandable considering regular players since most people don’t buy sweeper until they complete ward items nor pink wards and get tp’ed by top laner to suffer for rest of the game.  I really hope they will think of something for proplay otherwise the meta will be in a really small champion pool for a long time with character consists lane or just being safe. In my opinion we might be going back longer games with front to back team fights.
rbmseo,hnpejs4,hnpejs4,Teleport change in PBE,n00bcheese,12/08/2021,2,Hopefully it commits as imo will make watching pro play way more interesting it was so lazy to be able to TP directly back to minions in lane so early maybe it ain’t much but reckon it makes a decent impact
rbmseo,hnpnm78,hnpnm78,Teleport change in PBE,Maloonyy,12/08/2021,2,Actually good no more is bot lane a free double kill once tp comes up.
rbmseo,hnpoowp,hnpoowp,Teleport change in PBE,Key_Rate_9245,12/08/2021,2,in pro play this is drastic since the best time to to is when youre usually doing a four man gank bot or drag. in solo que it wont mean much since its much better to tp to your lane pre 15 mins in the game. its just because if you tp somewhere without getting anything thats drastic in soloque. idk how many times I won games simply by not tping and understanding that a farmed irelia can kill any fed adc.
rbmseo,hnpt35p,hnpt35p,Teleport change in PBE,WarwickIsMyWaifu,12/08/2021,2,Good now the typical: die at level one teleport right back and die immediately again wont happen anymore and toplaners cant throw away the game within 15 seconds anymore.
rbmseo,hnp6cyx,hnp6cyx,Teleport change in PBE,itsallabigshow,12/08/2021,1,Good bless. Good change.
rbmseo,hnp9wld,hnp9wld,Teleport change in PBE,Radiant_Shelter688,12/08/2021,2,Ah yes cant wait to deal with Ignite top. Thank you Riot.
rbmseo,hnpas5v,hnpas5v,Teleport change in PBE,SeanTYH,12/08/2021,2,This kinda makes absolutely zero sense. At the very least this should be an allied minion or tower but not wards so at least you can make tp plays to another lane but that laner can still run or have counterplay. Or just being unable to tp on wards for the first x minutes of the game.   Nerfs should still allow for plays to happen but maybe less frequently instead of just saying fuck you no.
rbmseo,hnpazop,hnpazop,Teleport change in PBE,Lyonex,12/08/2021,2,WTF Riot?
rbmseo,hnpof3q,hnpof3q,Teleport change in PBE,daveythedumb,12/08/2021,2,I mean teleport was fucking insane if people knew how to abuse it but why do they want to make games longer ??

rbmseo,hnpd66t,hnpd66t,Teleport change in PBE,genetik3295,12/08/2021,1,This makes playing botlane SO MUCH better.
rbmseo,hnpidxk,hnpidxk,Teleport change in PBE,neutral-hamster57,12/08/2021,2,I hope this doesnt get past pbe bc even if it helps the champions I usually bc it removes counterplay I think that it removes an important part of macro game
rbmseo,hnps2cl,hnps2cl,Teleport change in PBE,Bro_miscuous,12/08/2021,2,Honestly fuck teleport ganks when I 2v2.
rbmseo,hnpbisr,hnpbisr,Teleport change in PBE,BlueKayn29,12/08/2021,1,Simple just walk to bot then tp to top tower
rbmseo,hnpdb7y,hnpdb7y,Teleport change in PBE,alexpheal,12/08/2021,0,Thats huge for competitive games it was so boring to see every botlane 2vs2 kill attempt transforming into a teleport fiesta
rbmseo,hnpevin,hnpevin,Teleport change in PBE,Nahkriiin,12/08/2021,0,Idk how ppl say its unfair/unskilled to tp to botlane. Imagine you play toplane outtrade enemy opponent and force him back. You are able to shove the lane in and get a good reset meanwhile the enemy toplaner must tp back to catchup the wave. Now you have the advantage to help ur team cuz you abuse the tempo. This is legit a prime example of how to use Macro in a competitive game. Or the mechanic that you tp on a minion to maintain a freeze would be gone also. Its just so stupid once again that riot makes the game unfun for player who are actually good at the game
rbmseo,hnpfc03,hnpfc03,Teleport change in PBE,Captain_Chogath,12/08/2021,1,This is so damn big the benefits outweigh any negatives massively.
rbmseo,hnp6t8z,hnp6t8z,Teleport change in PBE,Moon_Breaker,12/08/2021,1,Personally I stopped taking Teleport in most solo queue games once plates became a thing anyway.  Stomping lane and taking plates is guaranteed gold compared to the this teleport might pay out of the old days.  Usually if the enemy is silly enough to tele away I manage to shove 2-3 waves under and take 2-3 plates before they even think of coming back with their 2 assists.  &#x200B  For more organized play though... Ouch.  Im just a scrub playing Clash with strangers as a free agent and I still make TP plays to bottom lane quite often.  Unlike solo queue I normally trust that the team will play around the bot lane carry later and getting them ahead is generally worth it.  Id imagine itll really change up the gameplay meta for true organized(pro) play.  &#x200B  Probably also be a unintended buff to TF/Ryze/Galio/Shen/whoever I might be forgetting as their laner cant just follow them with TP anymore at level 6.
rbmseo,hnpcwzw,hnpcwzw,Teleport change in PBE,Iperovic,12/08/2021,1,Thank fuck for this theres nothing more fucking annoying than playing scared because the enemy is running 2 sometimes 3 teleports and your team has 1 or even 0
rbmseo,hnpijwe,hnpijwe,Teleport change in PBE,Crazymage321,12/08/2021,1,Good change teleport teamdiff always sucked
rbmseo,hnpt1g4,hnpt1g4,Teleport change in PBE,WorstTactics,12/08/2021,1,People unironically suggesting for TP to be removed from the game but ignite is FINE. Yeah good idea guys!
rbmseo,hnq24zz,hnq24zz,Teleport change in PBE,I_am_not_Serabia,12/08/2021,1,Top mains here acting like tping to bot is the only way to get out of the lane. You guys know you can: roam mid invade the jungle or even go from base to bot and them tp to ur own top turret after everything. But no here people are only like: I cannot tp bot then i cannot do anything in the game.
rbmseo,hnpd09y,hnpd09y,Teleport change in PBE,Tron_Impact,12/08/2021,-2,Top laners malding they can’t win their own lane and bot lane by themselves meanwhile bot laners can’t even win their own fucking lane on their own. Oh im so sorry you have less agency have you ever tried literally having half of your fucking laning phase decided by someone else on top of being teleported on by 2 other members.
rbmseo,hnpbgf1,hnpbgf1,Teleport change in PBE,Drengar,12/08/2021,1,This is actually a pretty reasonable change as an alternative to buffing botlane XP. Instead of lvl 7 top tp’ing bot onto wave vs lvl 4/5 bot the toplaner just isnt allowed to tp bot anymore and change the fight pre14z   Also interested to see how this effects the tp vs ignite matchup top. Will soloq players just abandon the spell for a few weeks?
rbmseo,hnpa1ty,hnpa1ty,Teleport change in PBE,B4ndito,12/08/2021,1,There is no TP as far as I know in Wild Rift and it works so maybe it is not end of the world.
rbmseo,hnpakkh,hnpakkh,Teleport change in PBE,XXXVI,12/08/2021,1,Probably a buff for me as I main Kayle still Im unsure if I like this change
rbmseo,hnpbmcn,hnpbmcn,Teleport change in PBE,Intarhorn,12/08/2021,1,Lovely change. Perfect. Should make bot lane aggression more rewarding.
rbmseo,hnphtsv,hnphtsv,Teleport change in PBE,Nemesis233,12/08/2021,1,<br><br> had me laughing
rbmseo,hnpmf95,hnpmf95,Teleport change in PBE,ADeadMansName,12/08/2021,1,Very good. Still strange to not just remove the ability to TP onto wards. Minions and turrets are ok. It slows the game down in competitive so much because of your team having to sweep step by step and if they miss a ward you easily get fucked by it.  Minions can be locked behind the 14 minute mark still.
rbmseo,hnpqqy7,hnpqqy7,Teleport change in PBE,Sl_hero999,12/08/2021,1,Good  now kata cant tp bot at 5 min for a triple kill
rbmseo,hnpqrn2,hnpqrn2,Teleport change in PBE,antraxsuicide,12/08/2021,1,14 minutes is a good line for this. Matches up with turret plates.
rbmseo,hnprz8y,hnprz8y,Teleport change in PBE,Imyourlandlord,12/08/2021,1,Nice....give junglers more bot prio.....
rbmseo,hnpsqm7,hnpsqm7,Teleport change in PBE,Alabugin,12/08/2021,1,Good. Top will need to reset go bot hope wards are clear then gank. Then just TP back top.
rbmseo,hnpu2ks,hnpu2ks,Teleport change in PBE,EinSabo,12/08/2021,1,Riot trying everything they can to appeal to adc mains so they can keep being the only factor that matters. Bad adc? Too bad your lp is gone.
rbmseo,hnpuuqv,hnpuuqv,Teleport change in PBE,MonsieurCoty,12/08/2021,1,Just put it on higher cd if TP is used on a non structure object? Why fully remove the only teamplay tool at the disposal of the most isolated role ? I will roam from base anyways botlaners dont deserve a peaceful passive lane.
rbmseo,hnpc7hw,hnpc7hw,Teleport change in PBE,Phemeth,12/08/2021,-3,This is not such a good idea the game is already going towards late game anyway killing tp on wards will definetly hinder early game champions even more if they want to create counterplay to ward tps they should make TP visible trough fog of ward and on minimap when someone TPs.  Making the top laner sit top with his 2nd tp up will only force a boring top lane stalemate where both are tping back to lane and farming while being completely terrified of losing lane and not being able to impact the map at all after losing T1 since they have to sit under T2 and have no way of matching to to the opponent roaming its such a baffling idea and an enforcement of meta for no discernable reason especially between minute 11 and 14.  If one laner wants to tp gank bot lane let them do it it creates important early game dynamics and the opposing laner can react to it with platings one option to more heavily discourage early TP ganks could be making Fortification only on T1 top only work when there are 2+ champions so top laners can punish harder the early tps when left alone
rbmseo,hnp9qxn,hnp9qxn,Teleport change in PBE,KillerCryptid,12/08/2021,-1,Meh 90% of the playerbase wont notice this change
rbmseo,hnpaj60,hnpaj60,Teleport change in PBE,C9sButthole,12/08/2021,-3,Most players were using TP for lane pre 14 anyway I dont think this changes much for top tbh. Mid might start to shy away from it more though.
rbmseo,hnp7qrp,hnp7qrp,Teleport change in PBE,furiousRaMPaGe,12/08/2021,-8,Why tho imo TP is perfectly balanced as it is now. I dont see it being a problem in pro aswel..
rbmseo,hnpjwi8,hnpjwi8,Teleport change in PBE,BLlZER,12/08/2021,-1,The most broken summoner spell in the game and only now has actually been NERFED.      Thank fucking god.
rbmseo,hnpm5wg,hnpm5wg,Teleport change in PBE,AFarAwayTimeTraveler,12/08/2021,-1,This is a bad change. The summoner is practically useless behind or passed mid game when you’re pushing enemy territory.  Quite literally no reason in solo q to take this summoner or  play split push champions.   1. It’s allied structures only so when you’re pushing inhib or tier 2 you’re over extended and or can’t tp anywhere to the wave.   2. If your team is behind and lost turrets you can’t use this summoner to affect the map ever.   3. Post 30 mins this summoner will be a huge waste of a slot where you can just use exhaust or ignite.   Real stupid choice
rbmseo,hnp7qd8,hnp7qd8,Teleport change in PBE,aser08,12/08/2021,-3,So what is unleashed tp. Does it allow you to tp to wards and minions after 14 mins or what. Tping to structures only pre 14 sounds awful.
rbmseo,hnp8zkd,hnp8zkd,Teleport change in PBE,PaintedFog,12/08/2021,0,Not a bad change tbh. One of the smarter changes Riot has done recently and even if you think oppositely you can understand the logic behind this change.
rbmseo,hnpbjo0,hnpbjo0,Teleport change in PBE,Amxricaa,12/08/2021,0,YES YES YES YES THANK YOU RIOT
rbmseo,hnpdw43,hnpdw43,Teleport change in PBE,hotbooster9858,12/08/2021,0,As a D2+ top laner I love this change. It finally makes my lane more consistent and it kills the atrocity  of mid lane tp.
rbmseo,hnpi7gt,hnpi7gt,Teleport change in PBE,alo0oys,12/08/2021,0,Katarina players crying rn
rbmseo,hnplpkz,hnplpkz,Teleport change in PBE,Rexsaur,12/08/2021,0,The only bad thing about this is that its only the first 14 mins and not the entire game.  TP has needed this nerf since forever its too easy to turn fights anywhere on the map TP has been basically better than flash in terms of power for a while.
rbmseo,hnpm075,hnpm075,Teleport change in PBE,MadeInShurima,12/08/2021,0,Thank you now there wont be aram on botlane 6 minutes into the game.
rbmseo,hnpm5wu,hnpm5wu,Teleport change in PBE,QuinPal,12/08/2021,0,Nooo now Toplaners have to play the lane and Botlane can play aggressive now : ( 😭
rbmseo,hnp5avo,hnp5avo,Teleport change in PBE,-Quit,12/08/2021,-10,Not a big change if you ask me. Since plates top laners only teleport top lane because they dont want to lose or give anything and teleporting bot lane or for drag have become a thing of the past. Very rare when they would teleport elsewhere.
rbmseo,hnpia7z,hnpia7z,Teleport change in PBE,CEO-of-Zaun,12/08/2021,-1,So top laners and unskilled mids cannot disrupt my bot ganks now.   Finally a good change in S12.
rbmseo,hnp9gqo,hnp9gqo,Teleport change in PBE,Blastuch_v2,12/08/2021,1,Maybe take off random TP MS buff if you dont want tp to be so impactful in fights.
rbmseo,hnp9p1q,hnp9p1q,Teleport change in PBE,Natyrte,12/08/2021,1,they gotta be careful so league doesnt become a win lane win game kinda game(even more) especially for top laners and strong laners in the bot lane might get stronger.  also tank and weak laners in the top lane are gonna really drop in viability but i guess a few champions like Sion and Kled are probably fine since they gank from lane.
rbmseo,hnpa0k4,hnpa0k4,Teleport change in PBE,WeirdChamp960,12/08/2021,1,Can they atleast give it a lower CD in early Levels? Top already has the lowest KP across all roles im every region. This takes another thing away so you cant really Play with your team before 14minutes. Would be cool If they made it so the 3rd tp comes up sooner so you can use your tp to lane twice

rbmseo,hnpmapz,hnpmapz,Teleport change in PBE,geonik72,12/08/2021,1,Next patch tp will be single use only like stopwatch and you can only use it to tp from base to top lane if you are queued as top no exceptions

rbmseo,hnpodwl,hnpodwl,Teleport change in PBE,Linnus42,12/08/2021,1,Perhaps they can just make it so you can only teleport to turrets in the early game but mid game it lets you do it normally. Transition to occur between 10-20 mins.
rbmseo,hnpr21d,hnpr21d,Teleport change in PBE,PleutreLoL,12/08/2021,1,The channeling time is already 4sec
rbmseo,hnprt8y,hnprt8y,Teleport change in PBE,Slotherz,12/08/2021,1,I think many Mages will still prioritise it in mid lane.  Its such an interesting change. You know when watching worlds 2021 seeing what Elyoya basically had to do to counter TP flanks was all kinds of nuts.  This brings up a point about TP is removing TP flanks a downgrade in a skill of the game or have TP flanks offered too much to the team with the TP adv?
rbmseo,hnpswqk,hnpswqk,Teleport change in PBE,After_Signature_6580,12/08/2021,1,This is a complete nerf to LSs coaching style lmfao
rbmseo,hnpt0dp,hnpt0dp,Teleport change in PBE,SamsungBaker,12/08/2021,1,Good change it was frustrating as midlaner how you had to take TP everytime   Lets hope we will shift out from this waveclear + roam playstyle
rbmseo,hnpt0z4,hnpt0z4,Teleport change in PBE,Tirriss,12/08/2021,1,Oh boy first they -rightfully- nerf predator and now that. I guess they really want us in the jungle.
rbmseo,hnptfit,hnptfit,Teleport change in PBE,DremoPaff,12/08/2021,1,Can they at least bring back the old cooldown reduction when tping on towers??
rbmseo,hnptg9i,hnptg9i,Teleport change in PBE,TyphonXT,12/08/2021,1,Ah yes we dont want top lane to have impact nonono just bash your heads in and take ignite
rbmseo,hnpthz2,hnpthz2,Teleport change in PBE,Blacklance8,12/08/2021,1,Oh yer just remove the only way the top laner has any impact on early why doesnt we. But on a serious note why are we charging tp rather then idk the damage problem that everyones been complaining about
rbmseo,hnptmm7,hnptmm7,Teleport change in PBE,Dracoola,12/08/2021,1,They should make it so that you could also teleport to Control Wards. That way it makes sense to be punished if you didnt clear good enough and it kinda makes sense cause control ward I guess. Right now with 1 lens its impossible to clear every potential ward on bot that a top laner can teleport to
rbmseo,hnptqsx,hnptqsx,Teleport change in PBE,LunalaLuana,12/08/2021,1,meanwhile everyone still takes flash since years now and nobody cares

rbmseo,hnpxdnc,hnpxdnc,Teleport change in PBE,Vytral,12/08/2021,1,I honestly really dislike this added complexity. I feel it compromises the longevity of the game because players who stopped playing will have a hard time getting back in (and dont let me speak of new players).   It should either only teleport to turrets whole game or not at all. Having a summoners spell drastically change behaviour mid game because you cant balance it otherwise is just lazy and TERRIBLE game design
rbmseo,hnpxr4r,hnpxr4r,Teleport change in PBE,TheHippySteve,12/08/2021,1,In competitive this is a huge push towards flashless top laners and aggro bot lanes
rbmseo,hnpxy7c,hnpxy7c,Teleport change in PBE,mrpeanut332,12/08/2021,1,Why don’t they just remove the movement speed from tp instead? It would solve the same problem and keep top lane allowed to participate in dragon fights and such.
rbmseo,hnpy06a,hnpy06a,Teleport change in PBE,SpaceMarine_CR,12/08/2021,1,Sorry Zac couldnt save you
rbmseo,hnpy448,hnpy448,Teleport change in PBE,IforgotmyAOLpassword,12/08/2021,1,Fucking hate this change. I get why its necessary to gate tp in high elo and especially pro since like half the team takes it there but I think this is a terrible way to go about this.

rbmseo,hnpyvbt,hnpyvbt,Teleport change in PBE,Dlooph,12/08/2021,1,Not a fan this removes an important skill that shows the difference between good and bad toplaners.  Finding the perfect window and communicating a play botside can be one of the most rewarding things in the game if you manage to pull it off. It takes multiple parts like your support adc or jungler getting a deep ward managing the waves correctly and even then youll certainly lose something in Top if they dont follow your TP.

rbmseo,hnq1ilh,hnq1ilh,Teleport change in PBE,Sarazam,12/08/2021,1,I guess this makes bot lane less of a 5v5. Can only really teleport bot to prevent dives.
rbmseo,hnq1kgk,hnq1kgk,Teleport change in PBE,ProEngineer3000,12/08/2021,1,I get the change and I dont think its necessarily bad but... it will definitely have a lot of repercussions if it does end up making it to live. Certainly an interesting change nonetheless seems like it will make the game a have a bit more focus on individual skill while reducing the number of early skirmishes.
rbmseo,hnq1lg4,hnq1lg4,Teleport change in PBE,Tight_Flamingo4650,12/08/2021,1,They better not push this to live WITH katarina nerfs or she will be officially kneecapped

rbmseo,hnq5xzn,hnq5xzn,Teleport change in PBE,Zeddit_B,12/08/2021,1,I think this will open up a lot more action pre-14 especially in pro play. The timer coincides with plates coming off so its not that out of place. As a jungler Im tired of getting counter ganked by mid and top because I didnt track the timers or know if my team could cancel the TP...
rbmseo,hnq5zsl,hnq5zsl,Teleport change in PBE,Antenoralol,12/08/2021,1,As a bot laner I love this change.  No more stepping 1cm out of line and getting double tpd on to minions/wards.

rbmseo,hnq81as,hnq81as,Teleport change in PBE,_negniN,12/08/2021,1,At this point theres absolutely no reason to actually play top unless you have counterpick. Like if your enemy top is picking after you you might as well just dodge.  This change makes sure youre in no way useful neither to yourself nor your team in a losing matchup.
rbmseo,hnq86uy,hnq86uy,Teleport change in PBE,nekofrog,12/08/2021,1,Honestly this game keeps getting worse. I keep hoping itll go back to something resembling strategy but thats obviously never happening :(
rbmseo,hnq8ai1,hnq8ai1,Teleport change in PBE,zennok,12/08/2021,1,On one hand I dislike this because it seems to just make early game less interesting  On the other hand this means people will stop TPing to the cannon minion as im about to stack it.  Im conflicted

rbmseo,hnq9bwd,hnq9bwd,Teleport change in PBE,RoboSpark725,12/08/2021,1,Cool so top lane is even less impactful now. Why the fuck is Riot so hellbent on making top lane entirely useless? They may as well just make it so that if you queue top you just get put into a 1v1 on Howling Abyss.
rbmseo,hnq9idx,hnq9idx,Teleport change in PBE,funkymonkey3693,12/08/2021,1,Meanwhile flash is untouched.  One day we will have more than one summoner spell choice.  Because flash is almost always one of the two.
rbmseo,hnq9pse,hnq9pse,Teleport change in PBE,CohnDev,12/08/2021,1,Good TP has been broken forever. It scales with player skill more than any other sum by far and hopefully this can curve that a little. I wish this season has a Summoner Spell rework. I feel like they have so much potential to be cool but theyre all still basically exactly how they were 10 years ago.
rbmseo,hnqacel,hnqacel,Teleport change in PBE,8u11etpr00f,12/08/2021,1,Must admit I havent played league in quite a while but this change seems....awful?  Teleporting to wards was one of the main ways to punish overextension and get a losing lane back into the game. Without the threat of TP it means losing botlane could be incredibly painful as the enemy can just ward tri brush and shove up to the tower 24/7 without the threat of anything flanking them.  Also for solo laners it diminishes playmaking potential as its gonna be really hard to catch up to the enemy if youre starting at the turret. It encourages TP to only be used for returning to lane and catching waves which promotes things like top lane island.  Overall I think it encourages laning rigidity which scraps a lot of the complexity in the early-mid game and puts more emphasis on winning your own lane matchup. Im sure that sounds great for some but imo it makes the game worse because when youre losing lane its gonna feel like shit.
rbmseo,hnqaqvw,hnqaqvw,Teleport change in PBE,FerrariRocker,12/08/2021,1,> target allied structure    Can TP to Heimer turrets?

rbmseo,hnqbpld,hnqbpld,Teleport change in PBE,dogwithasword,12/08/2021,1,i play both top and bot lane and while this really fucking sucks for top laners because they can actually no longer impact the map pre-14 its really good for bot lane players who no longer have to worry about mid and top tping to their lane because they tried to actually use their lead to win lane.   &#x200B  playing adc sucks. it really does. it feels bad to play. 4 or even 5 man dives constantly going 3/0/1 in lane only to lose because the enemy has a champ like camille or katarina which makes you unable to play the game... the role is just unforgiving. but this tp change will give botlane players some agency to be able to do stuff without top laners tping in and fucking them over. i actually kind of like this although i will be taking ignite on all my top laners unless im picking shen.

A TP bot doesn’t instantly win you the game if it’s a bad TP.  Also I’m seeing a lot of people saying there’s no counterplay to early TPs bot mostly the infamous brush ward TPs. But the counterplay is visioncontrol and actually thinking and playing according to enemy teams summ CDs.  ”Oh enemy has TP advantage and we haven’t swept the brushes for a potential TP ward? Maybe we shouldn’t overextend. Maybe we should try gain vision in their jungle help our jungler take drake roam mid or reset.”

They didnt care about tps to begin with.  Being able to only TP to turrets means that you dont have to worry about bullshit mid ganks and recall/revive>safeguard* (meant homeguard)>tp bullshit after you win a 1v1 huge win for likes of Trynda.  Obviously a massive buff to botlane which in pro play gets visited and tp ganked by every laner and their dog.

I get fed on top almost every fucking game and lose because I fail to properly utilize my lead into my other lanes. Now it will be even HARDER for me to do this. What the fuck else am I supposed to do when my bot lane has a weakside matchup and is constantly pushed under their tower and feeding gold? Fucking roll over and die? Kled isn’t a god damn late game carry champ. I am supposed to help my laners get fed so they can carry late game with my lead.  So unbelievably fucking dumb.

rbmseo,hnpy670,hnpy670,Teleport change in PBE,Head_Haunter,12/08/2021,1,Oh thank god. When bot lane gets fucking 4 man dove fucking 9 minutes into the game youre just like well fuck me right?   Worst part is your team starts to flame you for losing but the top laner couldnt even get first turret despite their opponent TPing bot.
rbmseo,hnpz2co,hnpz2co,Teleport change in PBE,OhanaMeansFamily69,12/08/2021,0,thank god bot lane is getting buffed now it might go from obviously the most broken lane to anyone with a functioning fucking brain to obviously the best lane to every single league of legends player
rbmseo,hnphbk5,hnphbk5,Teleport change in PBE,piiees,12/08/2021,1,Definitely a change to deter the good old 2v5 dive to destroy your ass in botlane strat. Theres still the 2v4 with their mid/jng ganking though which if the enemy is reasonably coordinated they can still pull off quite successfully. but I guess you just got to respect the mid roam/have your mid call roams/not be completely tunnel visioned and pay attention to your minimap ward and pay attention to your mid calling the roams (I definitely do not fall into that last couple of categories I promise).
rbmseo,hnpwmat,hnpwmat,Teleport change in PBE,ConebreadIH,12/08/2021,1,Just keep donkey pushing til 14min.  This is one step closer to the jungler box.
rbmseo,hnq7ulw,hnq7ulw,Teleport change in PBE,Jandromon,12/08/2021,1,Very necessary. Its extremely cringe that Janna+Ezreal are rewarded for doing nothing but having a better toplaner that insta TPs when the enemy Thresh finally lands a smart hook onto Ez which ends up being punished. That rewarded playing like a pussy bot doing nothing. Now aggressiveness bot is highly rewarded.
rbmseo,hnqa35q,hnqa35q,Teleport change in PBE,Corsharkgaming,12/08/2021,1,Removed winning top lanes win condition though.
rbmseo,hnqhqhj,hnqhqhj,Teleport change in PBE,DoYouMindIfIAsk_,12/08/2021,1,Im really glad they needed to like this. As a support main I never have enough wards to cover all the bushes. So in a way tp was pretty much unstoppable.  In pro games way tooany TPs because its the only way to counter a tp..with another tp
rbmseo,hnpx78i,hnpx78i,Teleport change in PBE,TitanOfShades,12/08/2021,0,Yeah and toplane now has even less impact on the game. Why not just remove that lane altogether? Just put the two toplaners on the fucking howling abyss to duke it out and theyll have about as much impact on the game.
rbmseo,hnpfjzt,hnpfjzt,Teleport change in PBE,NeitherAlexNorAlice,12/08/2021,-70,Good. They can delete TP for all I care about. Im tired of winning lane through sheer out-plays but losing all of that because enemy just TPs into a clueless overstaying bot to get two kills.
rbmseo,hnpcy4t,hnpcy4t,Teleport change in PBE,G33ke3,12/08/2021,249,This was my first thought also. This part is actually a huge buff to top agency it makes really early kills on your lane opponent way better for champs with early wave clear. (which is reasonably common for top champs) They still get the XP/gold but you can finish shoving and take a recall to immediately spend that gold now without trading TP’s.
rbmseo,hnpea0j,hnpea0j,Teleport change in PBE,Freakkopath,12/08/2021,20,Yeah that’s actually huge
rbmseo,hnps7e9,hnps7e9,Teleport change in PBE,evandrew,12/08/2021,17,Wouldnt the solution then be to stop making minions invulnerable during a TP? If the minion dies the tp channel still completes in that specific location. This allows for early TP plays while making it easier to crash a wave after a successful gank.

rbmseo,hnpfacp,hnpfacp,Teleport change in PBE,DC_Flint,12/08/2021,-12,so go base and match with your own teleport?   This is actually a huge part of wave management removing this makes top _less_ skill reliant not more.
rbmseo,hnppvl6,hnppvl6,Teleport change in PBE,sowydso,12/08/2021,1,Why would you shove in this situation and not back and tp to lane?  Im asking bc Im literally bad at the game

rbmseo,hnpsus3,hnpsus3,Teleport change in PBE,sanic420mph,12/08/2021,1,So true actually kind of a huge buff to ignite/ghost in top lane. As this was the main reason in not taking them.
rbmseo,hnqfanm,hnqfanm,Teleport change in PBE,LezBeHonestHere_,12/08/2021,1,It actually makes Kayle level 1 solos a viable strategy lol. Previously it was basically never worth it to go for a lv1 kill or all-in vs any competent opponent because youd be fucked at low hp whether you get the kill or not and frozen on permanently because of this and youd have to use your own teleport after recall anyway so you wouldnt even have tp advantage.
rbmseo,hnpgeqe,hnpgeqe,Teleport change in PBE,pereza0,12/08/2021,-1,As a guy that played Trundle top with Ignite for a while this hits home.   Didnt feel fair to lose lane to Summs diff because I got FB lvl 1
rbmseo,hnpf5fm,hnpf5fm,Teleport change in PBE,BudgetFar380,12/08/2021,0,TRUE. Holy this change is so based.
rbmseo,hnpk350,hnpk350,Teleport change in PBE,N0UMENON1,12/08/2021,0,They can still tp to tower though. Not many top laners can push the wave fast enough for this to matter.
rbmseo,hnq3435,hnq3435,Teleport change in PBE,ExceedinglyLonelyCat,12/08/2021,1,just kill them again if the wave is stacked. If you are someone who can block autos or shield/heal like Fiora Jax Camille it is easy to use the stacked wave to stop them from freezing most of the time they tp back with a cloth armor or long sword and you should have lv advantaged from that kill.
rbmseo,hnq7j7o,hnq7j7o,Teleport change in PBE,Akanan,12/08/2021,1,You still do need to shove!?     He can still tp back but at turret. Which gives you an opportunity to shove on time (not holding a minion) but doesnt guarantee to not get a freeze

rbmseo,hnq87bz,hnq87bz,Teleport change in PBE,Jandromon,12/08/2021,1,Its a buff for toplaners that like to fight earlygame: 1) if you solo kill him early he cant TP to a minion creating a freeze against you and 2) the losing toplaner cant TP bot to grab a quick double kill against the underlevelled botlane escaping from his losing matchup top. If you win toplane often youll like it.
rbmseo,hnpq2k7,hnpq2k7,Teleport change in PBE,PursueSomeBitches,12/08/2021,139,You vill get camped  You vill get frozen out of xp  And you vill be happy
rbmseo,hnpven4,hnpven4,Teleport change in PBE,licorices,12/08/2021,24,I feel this change does two major things.  Top lanes only role is to have tp to defend dives on your bot lane/mid.   Force top laners to sit on their ass because god forbid they get to help secure a dragon.
rbmseo,hnpszl6,hnpszl6,Teleport change in PBE,viktor25fsh,12/08/2021,77,ADC mains just wants you to sit and shut the fuck up in top lane and then peel them so they can have their protagonist syndrome fulfilled

rbmseo,hnqd4zo,hnqd4zo,Teleport change in PBE,ZanesTheArgent,12/08/2021,1,Finally a scenario to also force people to proactively build for hard tanking instead of just forcing everything through the lens of a sunfire pseudobruiser.

rbmseo,hnpwa5z,hnpwa5z,Teleport change in PBE,we_have_an_urgent,12/08/2021,26,Thats my one problem with this - its probably good for game health but the more specific situational rules get added onto things the less accessible the game becomes.
rbmseo,hnq5fzq,hnq5fzq,Teleport change in PBE,Zeddit_B,12/08/2021,1,The problem is that in pro a lot of plays cant happen because you know top and/or mid can just TP to the play. I think this will open up more pre-14 minute action.
rbmseo,hnqg66l,hnqg66l,Teleport change in PBE,TheMastobog,12/08/2021,1,Exactly this. The meta is no longer discovered it is enforced by the balance team adding niche interactions to kill gameplay they dont like (or just change it arbitrarily because change = good universally somehow /s)
rbmseo,hnpss1f,hnpss1f,Teleport change in PBE,AlternativeAward,12/08/2021,0,They are doing it since season 4 or even earlier
rbmseo,hnq2zo0,hnq2zo0,Teleport change in PBE,tomorrowdog,12/08/2021,1,I liked the days when Baroon boss spawned at 20 minutes but otherwise the map had more or less one ruleset.
rbmseo,hnppi4e,hnppi4e,Teleport change in PBE,froggison,12/08/2021,98,And so many of these mechanics are hidden! I started playing a year ago and it took me forever to learn about the extra armor. I just barely learned a month or so ago that the armor increases based on how many champions are around taking plates. And some things Im still not clear on--like when do blast cones *actually* spawn? They seem to spawn at random times but sometime before 1:30. Idk lmao there are dozens of things like that that are never explained.
rbmseo,hnpdbll,hnpdbll,Teleport change in PBE,Slowacki,12/08/2021,239,Yeah its like applying hacks over hacks over hacks in programming. At some point you realize youve built this extremely wobbly tower and touching one thing can cause many other blocks to fall.  &#x200B  They should really strive to build a solid base and then balance around it.
rbmseo,hnpftn7,hnpftn7,Teleport change in PBE,PM_something_German,12/08/2021,12,Its what happens when you have 5 fundamentally different roles but try to make them all as strong as each other.  You can add a lot of other stuff to this list like jungle/support items additional or reduced damage to minions/monsters. Different amounts of gold for different towers. Hell even different dragons with different attack speeds is already very irritating.
rbmseo,hnpkwzt,hnpkwzt,Teleport change in PBE,jacko4lyfyo,12/08/2021,113,Next year:  - Ranged champions are melee only for the first 7.4 minutes of the game. Buy ranged tokens at the shop for a temporary range boost.  - For the first 14.9 minutes junglers cannot leave the jungle except to base and collect creep waves from empty lanes.
rbmseo,hnpf67u,hnpf67u,Teleport change in PBE,WoorieKod,12/08/2021,53,In a few years wed have convoluted mechanics on top of simple mechanics like jojo stands - a turret but every lane has different armor removes platings at different interval different gold gain different damage to minion or whatever the fuck
rbmseo,hnpmeuz,hnpmeuz,Teleport change in PBE,Deathmarked,12/08/2021,10,Riot has implemented so many bad changes over the years (most of them being lazy band-aid fixes like this) that they dont even know how to fix anymore. For example the bot tower change you mentioned was to stop lane swaps in pro play because Riot doesnt really like strategy since they want the game to be a deathmatch now. At this point they are just completely lost and their only chance is to keep implementing these band-aid fixes otherwise they will have to rework half the game. 2016-2018 were some tough years for League.
rbmseo,hnpd66x,hnpd66x,Teleport change in PBE,PiBiscuit,12/08/2021,27,>Mid and Top tower have extra armor early bot doesnt.   So you want laneswap meta back?
rbmseo,hnp9enr,hnp9enr,Teleport change in PBE,Jozoz,12/08/2021,46,I agree with this. Its a very ugly solution but I think it still makes the game better.  I personally wouldve just straight up removed teleport from the game and balance from there but I guess they find that too extreme.
rbmseo,hnpgozg,hnpgozg,Teleport change in PBE,halofan642,12/08/2021,6,riot tried to bring in comeback mechanics this season and people bitched about it (partially cause it was to strong). what do you want them to do about the minion level stuff? it seems to me to be designed as a comeback/snowball mechanic depending how you view it. If the enemy has consistent level leads now their minions push into yours which means those brutal indefinite freezes top won’t happen as the wave will come into you.
rbmseo,hnplzaw,hnplzaw,Teleport change in PBE,Hazakurain,12/08/2021,2,TP should have been removed a long time ago
rbmseo,hnprqce,hnprqce,Teleport change in PBE,DG_Gonzo,12/08/2021,2,Been playing this game for 10 years and i peaked D4. I never knew about any of the stuff you mentioned. Like how am i even supposed to even imagine such mechanics are in the game?
rbmseo,hnpshf0,hnpshf0,Teleport change in PBE,Timberino94,12/08/2021,2,it is because ultimately riot does not want to break the meta that is 1 top 1 mid 2 bot. It is good for them to have a stable game state like this such that they can create KPIs to talk about in LCS etc and that the game is the same for casual fans regardless of what team they are watching. It limits strategy quite massively but thats the point diverging from this meta will always be nerfed to the ground and so its in riots best interest to balance the game around it.

rbmseo,hnpddl5,hnpddl5,Teleport change in PBE,DoorHingesKill,12/08/2021,12,Cause these niche mechanics are unobtrusive all things considered. Yeah you have to read burden of knowledge etc but unless youre trying to laneswap the armor disparity between bot and the solo lanes wont affect your gameplay whatsoever.  The alternative to this niche turret armor crap is some massive change to the entire early game that would somehow prevent the 0.01% from laneswapping while the 99.99% who couldnt give a fuck about laneswaps have to deal with it.  They try to fix these problems without changing the game.  Here with teleport they have 3 options leave it as is do what theyre doing rn or get rid of teleport. Id take the one in the middle.
rbmseo,hnppda1,hnppda1,Teleport change in PBE,elveszett,12/08/2021,1,Im still pissed at things like the gold cap on lane minions for junglers before min 20. If you need to introduce a mechanic that is basically if you reproduce this set of steps your champion explodes instead maybe you should reconsider how you want to nerf a problem.  At some point its hard to rationalize what you should do now when mechanics are this specific and full of exceptions.  Also Id like to know why some specific dashes in league cant jump over walls. Like who decided that Vi shouldnt need to care about walls but Lillia jumping one would be broken?
rbmseo,hnphm0i,hnphm0i,Teleport change in PBE,Anarchontologist,12/08/2021,-1,Theyre starting to make a really bad Hobby Board Game.  Just fiddly mechanics that are stupid because their game is getting too bloated with dumb convoluted details (like the wonky shitty dragons they added that give you perma-fog and Heroes of the Storm portals around the map).  League is starting to jump the shark big time
rbmseo,hnpkzh8,hnpkzh8,Teleport change in PBE,Clemenx00,12/08/2021,1,Really disagree. These little changes in unexpected places are better than broad strokes.  Theres nothing to learn here other than a single sentence. Youre overrating the amount of info needed.
rbmseo,hnph7cr,hnph7cr,Teleport change in PBE,SilvertheHedgehoog,12/08/2021,1,Do you know what the meta was like when top and mid had no early damage reduction? A sluggish clusterfuck.   The game was basically a PvE for everyone but mid laners since the strategy to make your bot lane vs a top laner was so strong top laners had to go with the jungler and scramble to have any resources.
rbmseo,hnpl0zg,hnpl0zg,Teleport change in PBE,Zanderax,12/08/2021,1,This is how I feel about all jungle changes since season 4. Theyve tried to make jungke an official thing and give it specific mechanics. It jumped to be youd have to oick a champion that had good life steal or tackiness of healing just to survive jungle. Now with jungle items every champion can do a full first clear but its so much harder without smite or jungle item
rbmseo,hnpmfom,hnpmfom,Teleport change in PBE,Funkydick,12/08/2021,1,Its true that there are many obscure mechanics in the game that many people dont know about but fact is just that the different lanes arent balanced the same because theyre not the same and because players abused that in the past. I dont really see the issue unless you want to argue that things like laneswap meta or lvl 4-6 botlane TPs are good for the game which is a different topic
rbmseo,hnpntnk,hnpntnk,Teleport change in PBE,ADeadMansName,12/08/2021,1,Because most of these things cant be balanced otherwise.  Tell me a way to prevent the 4/0 lane swap meta without the turret change?  How do you reduce the impact of the mid lane without actually targeting the mid lane (except reducing the minion MS while they move towards the middle of the lane so that all 3 lanes clash at the same time which was a change pro teams didnt want).
rbmseo,hnpsncc,hnpsncc,Teleport change in PBE,Daniel_snoopeh,12/08/2021,1,To be fair the extra armor on tower was an hard force to end the roleswap meta and I call this a success

rbmseo,hnqk0yp,hnqk0yp,Teleport change in PBE,WeDoALittleTrolIing,12/08/2021,1,The reason bot doesn’t have armor is because of an old pro play strat you would swap bot and top and send a champ who was still useful while behind like a tank into a 1v2 and 2v1 the enemy top
rbmseo,hnqk4yq,hnqk4yq,Teleport change in PBE,PsychicFoxWithSpoons,12/08/2021,1,Youre not supposed to be thinking about all of this. These mechanics are supposed to be invisible and unimportant for the vast majority of players while adding an extra dimension of optimization for those who are an echelon above the rest.   The highest ranking players even the ones who are just diamond are amazing optimizers who can easily take into account all the different mechanics you just listed and make good decisions based on them. Meanwhile none of these things actually matters to a bronze player since theyre really busy trying to optimize how not to die to Zed in midgame teamfights by buying a Stopwatch.   This isnt Dota and Riot balances for all skill levels simultaneously. Adding invisible macro mechanics is a fairly straightforward way to make the game more interesting at high elo without making it too dizzyingly complex for players who dont really have the skill to think about stuff besides comboing their ulti with flash or buying a good item for the situation.

Can you not get the push top then help your jungler invade or secure top lane scuttle?  You dont *have* to be able to TP bot to have map impact early game.
rbmseo,hnpy5xc,hnpy5xc,Teleport change in PBE,The-War-Life,12/08/2021,3,Forcing lane freeze by tping to minions is the most cancer shit ever. Being solo killed shouldn’t force the enemy top into a losing state where they have to trade tps or else get their wave frozen.
rbmseo,hnpvteo,hnpvteo,Teleport change in PBE,happygreenturtle,12/08/2021,1,I disagree because:   1) You can still impact the map you just have to play your timers more precisely than being able to ooga booga TP to any fight that was happening with no prior planning except walking away from the enemy top so they cant cancel it. Now you can try to crash a wave recall and walk to mid/bot for dragon and then use TP to get back to your lane. Not that Id even recommend this because I think TP is best used for winning your lane and securing/denying platings in the first 14 minutes.   2) Ok. You cant force lane freezes by tping to creeps. You can still freeze in the standard way. Could be argued that TPing to a minion being focused by the enemy wave was a gimmick and its not necessarily a bad thing that Riot removed it. Something existing doesnt inherently make it good.   3) TP still has as much benefit for lane phase as it did before. Literally nothing has changed with regards to ignite vs TP for lane. The only difference is whether you used TP for cross map plays. And I highly doubt thats going to be a significant deterrent for most people who want to use TP. And theres also the mid-late game macro aspect of being able to push side lane and TP to objective. That has also not changed.  This is nice for bot laners (I am a Top/Jungle main) not having to worry about a teleport into their lane before theyve even had a chance to back for pinks/sweeper. It will barely change anything about the top 1v1 in isolation.   People are 100% overreacting
rbmseo,hnq8snv,hnq8snv,Teleport change in PBE,Jandromon,12/08/2021,1,* You can now kill the enemy laner earlygame and its worth it because you cant get frozen on thats a good thing. * You can still roam bot and TP back to top to defend after the play is over. Now it just takes more planning and skill than pressing TP the second the enemy Thresh finally lands a hook which only encourages Thresh to main Yuumi instead. * Toplane can still be balanced after this change if necessary in other ways. This change is to fix the two aforementioned problems.
rbmseo,hnqanh1,hnqanh1,Teleport change in PBE,rokingfrost,12/08/2021,1,uhh. you still CAN Back and tp to help with drake or herald. you can tp to top tower or bot tower is more slow BUT you still can do it tho.

If you pick tp on anything that isnt a hyperscalling champion that doesnt want to touch his enemies before 3 items you are trolling.

rbmseo,hnpip32,hnpip32,Teleport change in PBE,Eventari,12/08/2021,61,I dont see how a toplaner who just got killed 1v1 and tping on the last minion to freeze the lane is actually skill expression. Thats just punishing a toplaner for winning his 1v1 because he has no waveclear

rbmseo,hnp79tt,hnp79tt,Teleport change in PBE,Serek32,12/08/2021,382,No they are trying to salvage the botlane from lvl 6 irelia tping behind a lvl 4 duo because they got pushed in and had a bush warded once early or dared to step in front of their minion wave once they got an upper hand..... play some other roles sometimes to see how it feels - sincerely a fill palyer. Also please do not give me crap about your top tping too - by the nature of toplane one of the tops lost the lane hard and had to tp back by that time in 90% of the cases so he cannot respond/will be late/will tp and give one more kill just the same as had He stayed top.
rbmseo,hnp5le2,hnp5le2,Teleport change in PBE,SilenceOfRage,12/08/2021,27,It is a proplay change for sure I see what they want to do as to avoid botlane or gank to always get 1/2 fucking teleport coming everytime to fiesta but I feel it is very bad because it mean giving way less pressure early.  I really feel this meta is going to be heavily into scaling or make games longer. Better defensive item early scuttle being non important teleport potentially nerfed...
rbmseo,hnp5vfn,hnp5vfn,Teleport change in PBE,DHSUAUGEV,12/08/2021,45,They already did with last year tp nerfs. Wtf is this.
rbmseo,hnpab9q,hnpab9q,Teleport change in PBE,Umarill,12/08/2021,28,They are trying to stop 4 Teleports every game in pro play and the shitshow botlane when you have a ward behind you and cannot take any 2v2 unless you want to start the roaming circus visiting you immediatly.   It might not be the best solution but something has to be done. Teleport is just too strong early on in a controlled environment like pro-play.   In pro play every early game skirmish ends up in 4v4 due to teleports. Its not even like you sacrifice a lot for taking it because its also a very useful laning tool.  When champions like Gwen or Camille choose to sacrifice Flash and still keep Teleport you know something weird is going on with how strong it is. This change will be controversial but I think its for the best.
rbmseo,hnpqaef,hnpqaef,Teleport change in PBE,Mythik16,12/08/2021,2,Seeing as the meta was to play around top lane at worlds and in summer playoffs I dont think this will kill the role friend.
rbmseo,hnp8osi,hnp8osi,Teleport change in PBE,Jozoz,12/08/2021,5,Theyre trying to stop every skirmish becoming a pseudo-teamfight in pro play.  You didnt notice how in Worlds people would always insta-TP the moment something happened?  This is sorely needed for high level play. They can always buff top lane impact in other ways.
rbmseo,hnp76au,hnp76au,Teleport change in PBE,kibplaysit2,12/08/2021,-2,no they are trying to balance it god damn lethal champs are super saiyan 2 all the time they need to simmer down

rbmseo,hnp8z2w,hnp8z2w,Teleport change in PBE,Blank-612,12/08/2021,-7,This change makes top more fun change my mind. Ignite top lane in s3 s4 were more fun

rbmseo,hnpb1el,hnpb1el,Teleport change in PBE,Imgurisfunnier,12/08/2021,-1,This is a buff to carry/split push tops and a nerf to engage tops it will just adjust the top lane meta not hurt the role
rbmseo,hnpbh0a,hnpbh0a,Teleport change in PBE,JustJohnItalia,12/08/2021,72,Yeah but if youre playing bot you already have a lot of influence due to the fact that winning your lane puts 2 players ahead instead of one your tower doesnt have the defenses that mid and top do and botlane winning basically guarantees dragons.  What do I get for playing top though?
rbmseo,hnpnxag,hnpnxag,Teleport change in PBE,TheSoupKitchen,12/08/2021,1,Literally remove TP and overhaul summoner spells for more interesting and compelling choices. Either also removing flash from the game (or giving everyone flash and 2 optional summoners).  TP being used on 2 roles every game is boring and stale. Flash occupying everyones 2nd summoner slot isnt diverse. And ignite just counters the living shit out of heal. Exhaust was beginning to finally pick up steam as the better summoner for ADC (because it is).   They really could have changed summoners this season but instead they added 2 dragons and that was pretty much it...  It just feels like summoner spells have stayed the same for the entirety of the games lifespan and its probably one of the areas of the game in my opinion that needs a shake up the most. They also continually removed choices and stipped them from the game. Like revive fortify and surge.  I also totally agree that Teleport is horrible for the health of the game from a bot lane and ADC perspective. (Solo queue) but in competitive and esports leagues its mandatory and necessary for playmaking and coordination.   Just another design choice that shows Riot doesnt know wtf theyre doing.
rbmseo,hnp84pe,hnp84pe,Teleport change in PBE,throwawayfinggra,12/08/2021,14,i play around adc d1 in euw. yes it is big and it is good - as soon as the enemie has more tps than you you have to hope people dont tp bot behind you as soon as you engage on the enemey botlane.  If you want to play perfect you have to consider tp´s 24/7 which makes it almost impossible to play aggressive. I think it is a really good change
rbmseo,hnp5e6v,hnp5e6v,Teleport change in PBE,pbEliana,12/08/2021,4,Could be for the popular Katarina ignite/tp where you get shoved in early sack wave and TP bot super early to get a double kill. I haven’t seen many other champions do it as well as she does but yeah.   It sucks though because I love TP plays and have an extremely roaming playstyle. They can so win you or your laners the game either through kills or for countering early ganks.
rbmseo,hnq76s3,hnq76s3,Teleport change in PBE,NSawsome,12/08/2021,1,Don’t worry you’re still not safe from the lvl 3 jg diving you 3v2 and getting out

rbmseo,hnq4gcq,hnq4gcq,Teleport change in PBE,AbyssArray,12/08/2021,1,Youd have to do it the other way around walk towards the objective then TP back (probably after a base) - youd be counting on your teammates commiting to the play though
rbmseo,hnpz7dd,hnpz7dd,Teleport change in PBE,TitanOfShades,12/08/2021,1,Jungle feels awful right now roit has consistently drained XP and gold from the jungle so its either snowball or go fuck yourself.  But a good support especially when faces with a worse one can auto win games via vision and ganks. Theres nothing worse than having the enemy pyke appear top for a 3 or 4 man dive.
rbmseo,hnphe3y,hnphe3y,Teleport change in PBE,V_Dudez,12/08/2021,23,So as an adc when your top lane is losing you just shut up and lose the game ? Nice. Nevermind rewarding good junglers who setup around dragon and mark the enemy’s pathing while the bot duo carefully won the 2v2 so as to not lose lane advantage.  If you complain about a top laner not being able to tp into botlane then:  -Recall and move bot/drake earlier or cover mid while mid roams down  -Focus on winning your own lane  -If for some reason you’re losing top play safe in lane and play around the strong adc later
rbmseo,hnpzlpk,hnpzlpk,Teleport change in PBE,The-War-Life,12/08/2021,6,So basically a winning bot lane shouldn’t be allowed to push their lane. A Caitlyn Lux shouldn’t be allowed to push an Ezreal Yuumi because the enemy top laner exists. Yeah sure. Have you ever played anything other than top lane my guy?
rbmseo,hnq5l9l,hnq5l9l,Teleport change in PBE,NfinityBored,12/08/2021,1,So what prevents them from just holding tp the entire lane phase? It basically locks bot lane into doing nothing the entire game because going for a kill potentially loses them the lane. Top Laners dont understand how unfun it is to have your lane 100% decided by not the bot Lanes anymore.
rbmseo,hnpcuof,hnpcuof,Teleport change in PBE,turkishsupremacy31,12/08/2021,3,yes you will shut up and lose. just like how every botlaner just shuts up and loses when they have a losing top
rbmseo,hnpcgrb,hnpcgrb,Teleport change in PBE,dondiato,12/08/2021,3,Ill like to hijack one part of your comment:  Whats an ADC supposed to do if he wins lane but his Top Laner gets completely destroyed? There is no option to actually turn the tides Top by helping him/her - vice versa it was still possible to do so.

rbmseo,hnpxmq5,hnpxmq5,Teleport change in PBE,trapsinplace,12/08/2021,1,If you TP vote you have to walk back top. If you walk to bot you get to TP to top.  Its different but ultimately youre still able to affect botlane if you really really want to roam instead of letting mid/jungle do it. In solo Q basically anything goes as long as you get the kills.  I play Shen mostly so Im used to not running TP and instead using ult though. Only use tp in losing lanes.
rbmseo,hnpsvwl,hnpsvwl,Teleport change in PBE,Ryaize,12/08/2021,0,Your points dont matter. Your Leona support engages on the enemy adc. Enemy top laner tps on the wave. Your support is now dead. Enemy support flashes on you. Your now dead too.

rbmseo,hnq2b0l,hnq2b0l,Teleport change in PBE,Matte28,12/08/2021,0,Ye but there is a difference between Akali and Kat both have a lot of mobility so they dont must pick flash but: Akali despite being dogshit rn with the wr can easily kill the enemy laner I mean yesterday I played with an Akali top who won and killed several times Camille.    While Katarina cant do that in most lanes she has no damage early game to kill the enemy unless they misplay a lot Kata is literally a scaling champ who roams because she cant safely farm without tp her wr will go down a lot and her wr  is at 49.50% in the 11.23
rbmseo,hnpqhck,hnpqhck,Teleport change in PBE,Jentleman2g,12/08/2021,1,Ive never had an issue with them ofc I play morde so the more fed off my team my opponent is the more fed I am combine that with an exp lead and every tp bot just comes out relatively even.
rbmseo,hnprh1k,hnprh1k,Teleport change in PBE,BradL_13,12/08/2021,2,I could get behind this more.  Makes TP bot a bit more risky only being able to tp on minions and still allows you to tp to a heavy pushing lane onto enemy t2 or 3 tower after youve won a fight to really punish them.
rbmseo,hnqbtvd,hnqbtvd,Teleport change in PBE,shrubs311,12/08/2021,1,i feel like allowing you to tp to wards and structures is better than allowing you to tp to minions. tping to wards means your team had to set up that attack in some way as opposed to just botlane tried to fight tp on the wave and they have no chance. whereas if its on the ward it required the other team to set that up.  regardless i think removing wards OR minions alone would be a major nerf. im surprised they did both even if its only for 14 minutes
rbmseo,hnp91c7,hnp91c7,Teleport change in PBE,Blank-612,12/08/2021,58,> Its a shame cause Im a big roamer for my playstyle. I give up farm to roam mid/bot early multiple time  Top isnt the best role for this. Mid/jg/sup are all far better roamers.
rbmseo,hnp51c7,hnp51c7,Teleport change in PBE,Mostdakka,12/08/2021,-4,Early game as a toplaner your tp should be used on your own lane 99% of the time anyways. Tp to other lane before lvl 9-10 is only really worth it if you get a double kill. TP allows you to fix your lane very easly if you lose control over minions thats why you take it an not to necessarly tp to other lanes.  Thats for soloq of course where you cant really trust your teammates to carry. In competitive this will have huge implications.
rbmseo,hnpbjkn,hnpbjkn,Teleport change in PBE,SilenceOfRage,12/08/2021,-1,You can take ghost and roam mid or take ignite and just fight to hard stomp you ennemy/catch the ennemy jungler and assblast him.
rbmseo,hnpbvi3,hnpbvi3,Teleport change in PBE,Art_Zoe,12/08/2021,-1,Nah you still can. The strat is now to walk bot after recalling and get into a fight. Then you can tp top to catch the wave. More difficult but thats what they want from this change.
rbmseo,hnpby2l,hnpby2l,Teleport change in PBE,DingoThBOY,12/08/2021,-1,You should have never been doing that it’s objectively bad gameplay a majority of the time unless you are playing shen who could tp back after (and who will still be able to do that with this) if that was what you were looking for

rbmseo,hnq4m1s,hnq4m1s,Teleport change in PBE,NSawsome,12/08/2021,1,More hot take maybe bot shouldn’t be 2 levels down and able to get ganked lvl 1 by a lvl 3 shaco or ulted on by a lvl 6 Shen/hec/fiddle at lvl 4
rbmseo,hnpn9jm,hnpn9jm,Teleport change in PBE,Boockel,12/08/2021,-10,The hot take that is about as hot as I am.  Mate this kind of comment sucks off the seemingly massive proportion of adc/support mains on reddit you arent being controversial by saying this.
rbmseo,hnp8czb,hnp8czb,Teleport change in PBE,SnooAbbreviations503,12/08/2021,10,Uhm reduce the macro and strategy early game for more agressive play? I don’t know seem not a good for low apm player like me.
rbmseo,hnq501s,hnq501s,Teleport change in PBE,colefromreddit,12/08/2021,1,Maybe pro players will feel more comfortable trying to win lane by fighting each other instead of farming simulator until teammates come. I think it would make for more interesting and skill expressive comp play!   The better laner should be able to style on their opponent but often doesnt in pro play because they know they’re just asking to get tp flanked. Turning a proactive play into a misplay.
rbmseo,hnpft54,hnpft54,Teleport change in PBE,Caenen_,12/08/2021,3,Riot also loves people of any ranking being able to do what the best (pro) players do in your own game in League which is also why there is no adjusted balance or mechanics for pro play. The average soloQ player does not have the awareness or game experience to make a good TP gank bot lane and its a skill whichs mastery is hard to gage (should I have teleported bot here? Was my bot TP actually good? No idea.) so Riot is removing it because it probably *is* better for the game long-term.  I wonder if Riot will have to come up with mechanics to influence bot lane as a top laner nor or if the comeback systems they just added and a few champions being able to gank bot normally (e.g. Sion can just lane gank Shen can still R and then they TP back at a now-reduced cooldown) is already enough.
rbmseo,hnpaym2,hnpaym2,Teleport change in PBE,InspiringMilk,12/08/2021,-5,Then change pro play and leave the remaining 99.99% the same. Teleport is not an issue for most players so dont change it for most players

rbmseo,hnq64e0,hnq64e0,Teleport change in PBE,DarkProdigy820,12/08/2021,1,TP is mainly taken in pro play because it lets them use their macro. Its also a get out of jail free card in some situations. As was already mentioned 14 minutes is half of a game so removing tping to wards/minions removes tp macro for half of the game. Not to mention it also has the longest cooldown in the game. We’ve seen characters take ghost instead of flash but TP stays a staple because its safe and it lets you macro well. If assassin midlaners come back into the meta (Zed Qiyana etc) then we will 100% see more ignite taken in the midlane. But the meta right now doesnt favor them and its not because of TP.
rbmseo,hnqat30,hnqat30,Teleport change in PBE,KaraveIIe,12/08/2021,1,not really.
rbmseo,hnq72pq,hnq72pq,Teleport change in PBE,NSawsome,12/08/2021,1,Games average 28 minutes or less in gold and above so literally half the game or more if you’re not silver or bronze
rbmseo,hnpq322,hnpq322,Teleport change in PBE,Nhoebi,12/08/2021,1,Top lane has too much influence? xD its the least impactful role in the game...
rbmseo,hnpud9f,hnpud9f,Teleport change in PBE,Owen_newO,12/08/2021,3,Love this change because it increases ADC agency and allows for more all-ins pre 14 allows for a more volatile top lane and nerfs mage bot laners who were able to take teleport because they had great wave clear.
rbmseo,hnq6d78,hnq6d78,Teleport change in PBE,DarkProdigy820,12/08/2021,1,I dont think that jhin/nid traps count as “allied structures”. Wouldnt then heimer turrets and illaoi tentacles count too?
rbmseo,hnpsdjk,hnpsdjk,Teleport change in PBE,ArcusIgnium,12/08/2021,-11,lol top lanes are so salty but there are a number of top laners who get fed through bot lane and then just take over.
rbmseo,hnpq7jt,hnpq7jt,Teleport change in PBE,antraxsuicide,12/08/2021,5,I agree with this. Top laners (especially in solo queue) werent TPing to bot all that often unless a kill was guaranteed. Its just too long of a walk back.   This is 100% aimed at mid TP to reduce the bot lane parties especially in pro play.
rbmseo,hnppy7y,hnppy7y,Teleport change in PBE,AregularCat,12/08/2021,-9,The world revolves around me! The toplaner!
rbmseo,hnpitzh,hnpitzh,Teleport change in PBE,Icretz,12/08/2021,-7,Then the simple solution is to make ADC as strong as mids or tops with 1 item and have the same early game power. Then everyone will complain about ADC being overpowered.
rbmseo,hnp8iao,hnp8iao,Teleport change in PBE,Jozoz,12/08/2021,17,Theyre doing it to avoid every fight in pro play becoming a 5v5 fiesta.  So often we saw everyone insta-tp the moment bot lane was fighting.  With this change we might actually see some more individual skill mattering in lanes. Sorely fucking needed.
rbmseo,hnq5q7k,hnq5q7k,Teleport change in PBE,i-want-to-die-mabye,12/08/2021,1,Tbh i think its pretty good because the better team will force the enemy top to waste his tp in lane and go force a play drake side

rbmseo,hnqefsn,hnqefsn,Teleport change in PBE,KingFredo5674,12/08/2021,1,No no but you dont understand!! Our precious and special protagonist adc players that cant be bothered to keep track of vision and lack any form of map awareness need to carry the game!! How can they do that if other lanes are allowed to teleport to them? They need to single handedly carry the game for their team (theyre not called adCarry for nothing after all!!).   Plus dont you just enjoy being forced to stay in lane with a champion that counters you? Oh whats that? You made one mistake in lane? Sorry man guess you dont get to play the game anymore!! Oh is that the jungler I see over there? Damn guess you cant play the game now either sorry bud. Oh it looks like the support and mid player are coming around too to join in on the fun!   Top lane is such a fun role!
rbmseo,hnpj4as,hnpj4as,Teleport change in PBE,Angry---train,12/08/2021,4,Botlaners crying that the enemy toplaner might possibly kill them after sacrificing 600 gold in farm plates while they jerk of with no vision while being overextended
rbmseo,hnqjs0d,hnqjs0d,Teleport change in PBE,Venom5569,12/08/2021,1,Yeah its hilarious  theyve been alone on an island so long they dont know what its like to get an auto filled noob who throws the lane while you have to try and outplay the botlane duo while also getting TPd on by top laner  camped by the jungle and being constantly roamed on by the mid laner  Not to mention 75% of enemy supports are spell casting mages who have infinite mana and can just nuke you off  CS while said auto filled noob support is sitting behind you
rbmseo,hnpczm3,hnpczm3,Teleport change in PBE,TheWarmog,12/08/2021,2,There is tp.   Its a boots upgrade.    Also comparing 2 different games is wrong.

rbmseo,hnpfi97,hnpfi97,Teleport change in PBE,WoorieKod,12/08/2021,4,This changes top more than mid TP usage in mid will likely stay unchanged pre14 min but itll differ in top for sure
rbmseo,hnpcl85,hnpcl85,Teleport change in PBE,Fearlessmojo,12/08/2021,-3,Tp is a get out of jail free card. Fucked and got a bad trade in lane? About to miss out of 3 waves crashing on your tower? Got ganked and are now at 20% hp and risk getting dived? TP can save you from all these situations.   But not only was it a get out of jail free card it was also massive pressure on the map. At any moment early game you can tp to another lane and change the outcome of a fight and snowball your own team.   Now they are removing the roaming aspect of it and making it more of a get out of jail free card. (For the first 14min) it can still be extremely useful late game when you split push and your team heads to another objects you can join them right away.  I dont know what perfectly balanced means but this a game that keeps changing and evolving and they are trying to change things up especially in the pro scene where tp is utilized even more efficiently and can punish a play 10 times more then regular and makes snowballing games even worst
rbmseo,hnq627r,hnq627r,Teleport change in PBE,i-want-to-die-mabye,12/08/2021,1,Like flash has not been running for every single champion

You do realize that a single tp play bot is usually a profit of 600g at least. Unless youre losing 4 plates every time you tp its more valuable to tp bot just on the kills alone not to mention drag/your bot lane getting plates. Unless the only thing you put value on is gold in your pocket in which case theres no saving you.

rbmseo,hnq37ll,hnq37ll,Teleport change in PBE,Jeutnarg,12/08/2021,1,Shen already loves to ult bot lane for double kill participation early on. This buffs him by removing the counterplay option his opponents had of having their top laner tp in to keep the numbers even.

I think it’s probably good overall for tryn/nasus/darius types but might not be as good as it seems if at all.

rbmseo,hnpxbrv,hnpxbrv,Teleport change in PBE,Vytral,12/08/2021,67,I honestly really dislike this added complexity. I feel it compromises the longevity of the game because players who stopped playing will have a hard time getting back in (and dont let me speak of new players).  It should either only teleport to turrets whole game or not at all. Having a summoners spell drastically change behaviour mid game because you cant balance it otherwise is just lazy and TERRIBLE game design  Edit to clarify: I am not against big changes *per se* I am against changes that are inconsistent and hard to read. As an example think top turret and bot turret working drastically differently which is of huge importance and yet very difficult to read in-game if you do not know about it already

rbmseo,hnpagwh,hnpagwh,Teleport change in PBE,Merkantum,12/08/2021,229,Honestly its always super frustrating if the enemy toplaner teleports into your back before min 14 and you cannot do shit against it. Of course you can try to run but there is no way fighting 3v2 esp if the toplaner is 1-2 levels up and hungry for your ADC
rbmseo,hnpkzzi,hnpkzzi,Teleport change in PBE,ColdBeing,12/08/2021,2,Nah I think its because not only does Top use TP but Mid uses it too.   This is what happens when you try to make league champions able to lane everywhere. Brusiers were never played mid but here we are they can take TP and TP to opposing lanes this is the direction Riot went and they shouldve known. Many other mages take TP as well. You don’t see assassins taking TP  Game used to be where only designated champs went to designated roles frankly they shouldve kept it that way and not just seeing broken champs every game because theyre broken and played in every role..

rbmseo,hnqjaz8,hnqjaz8,Teleport change in PBE,Chubs1224,12/08/2021,1,I think this is to help early game champs compete with the boy ties being added.   That Draven/Nami bot lane can now shove you hard under turret without worrying about a TP flank until team fights which gives them a better chance of getting far enough ahead to not get put really far behind the moment a T1 tower falls with a bounty.  I also think it helps early top/mids because they can push and roam and dont have to worry about that Malzahar or Maokai just using TP to join after collecting their CS under turret at level 6.
rbmseo,hnqk3l6,hnqk3l6,Teleport change in PBE,Spitfire836,12/08/2021,1,About time ADC is borderline unplayable rn.  However it still wont do much for the role until crit items get buffed.

rbmseo,hnplmc6,hnplmc6,Teleport change in PBE,catseye013,12/08/2021,5,Okay so flip the scenario. What does your botlane do to help you when you’re getting destroyed in lane?

rbmseo,hnpomtm,hnpomtm,Teleport change in PBE,elveszett,12/08/2021,10,How is forcing you to waste a TP like that every single time more skill?

rbmseo,hnphbl0,hnphbl0,Teleport change in PBE,KCKrimson,12/08/2021,0,Yeah but the lane opponent gets a freeze and puts you in risky position. I like this change people can actually be punished for dying early on in lane.
rbmseo,hnpqpt0,hnpqpt0,Teleport change in PBE,tytyos,12/08/2021,8,Most of the time those kills happen from an exp lead which means you killed more minions already than enemy laner so your wave is most likely already pushing and a simple back + tp would just give a free freeze to the enemy
rbmseo,hnq25tf,hnq25tf,Teleport change in PBE,fridgebrine,12/08/2021,2,Because if you can make the wave crash then you don’t have to use your tp while the enemy does. Now your tp can be used to make plays while the enemy top laner is stuck in lane with no tp.  However if you’re low health then the enemy can tp to a minion and force a freeze since you can’t contest cos you’ll die. Now you’re forced to back and use tp to fix your wave. Tp play opportunities gone.

rbmseo,hnpqe6c,hnpqe6c,Teleport change in PBE,ihatethisweb,12/08/2021,1,Heres another one. They use the tech from the chem  dragon with something like noc r. So top lane from both sides is like its covered in fog or something for the season so for the first 14 minutes you cant see what your team is doing and only communicate with him through chat. This will make it so its an 1v1 and the jungle cant just follow the same clear path and gank top 4 times till he gets a kill. He will need to communicate with the top laner about were the wave is and if its gankple and it will. Pros: the better jungle will be able to utilise his ganking ability. The better top laner will be able to utilise his ganking set up. The team should ward around the top lane so its more to warn the top about enemy jg entering the top lane and trying to counter gank. Cons: yea gl playing vs duo top jg

The 5man tower taking funneling support items being used in solo lanes all have had pretty band-aid fixes and could use some real solutions. I think finding the alternative strategies and making those stronger would just be a better fix to it.

rbmseo,hnpeibh,hnpeibh,Teleport change in PBE,Mornos,12/08/2021,31,Im not totally opposed to it because I think counterplay to it would be discovered. Other than that I prefer a sensible solution that does not rely on niche mechanics. If we go further into the direction of niche mechanics the burden of knowledge and barrier of entry will only increase for new players. I dont want to suggest any solution here as it is the job of the huge balancing team.
rbmseo,hnpks54,hnpks54,Teleport change in PBE,raiyosss,12/08/2021,-6,Id argue that at this point the laneswap meta is already dead. Even if they removed the bonus armour the elemental drakes theyve added since are simply too important as a wincon to allow the map to be vertically split. Sure you get heralds but in pro play you cant end early with heralds like in soloq. At most it swings a turret gold and 75 extra from the actual objective at the cost of roughly the same in dragon bonus stats and a ticking time bomb known as the soul.
rbmseo,hnpnmf8,hnpnmf8,Teleport change in PBE,BIPOC_MARXIST,12/08/2021,0,They fixed that with first turret gold.
rbmseo,hnpeuaz,hnpeuaz,Teleport change in PBE,Royal-Donut2199,12/08/2021,28,I think removing TP causes too many problems. It buffs champions with global presence/roaming potential to an insane degree.  It also makes it so that champions with pushing power/dueling power to push harder creating unfun scenarios to play with and/or against. Yes you can potentially remove the ability for a 1-3-1/ 1-4 comp...but the champions who could do that anyways without tp to press that advantage can press that stuff harder.
rbmseo,hnpcubc,hnpcubc,Teleport change in PBE,Revil0us,12/08/2021,65,Removing tp would just ruin the fun for one toplaner in too many games. Imagine you die or youre forced to back and your opponent has the push. Now you lose 2 platings and 2 waves because of a single mistake and your lane is fucked. With tp youre atleast allowed to do one such mistake every ~6 min.  On top of that toplanes early game impact would be reduced significantly and splitpush would barely be possibly anymore.
rbmseo,hnpbswd,hnpbswd,Teleport change in PBE,DingoThBOY,12/08/2021,44,If they removed teleport I would quit it’s literally the most skill expressive summoner in the game and it makes macro at all stages of the game more complex and interesting

rbmseo,hnpp8j3,hnpp8j3,Teleport change in PBE,FreezingVenezuelan,12/08/2021,1,making tp a default summoner and balancing from there would be even better imo. It now works like recall every champ has it with cooldown. the game would be a lot more strategic if everyone could have tp
rbmseo,hnpcpqa,hnpcpqa,Teleport change in PBE,AliceInHololand,12/08/2021,0,I think they should consider creating a special summoner for toplane that grants top lane players a faster way to get to the lane. Top lane is an island and the worst feeling about the lane is that not only do you lack impact you can also get hard fucked completely outside of your control with no good methods of mitigation.  Botlane has two champions and good supports know when and how to hold waves for the adc. Jungle has no static lane and tbh if they’re getting hardcore invaded it’s a team gap and you’re probably not winning that match anyway. Midlane has the shortest distancd to traverse and is generally played by champions with strong waveclear. Top lane legit only has TP going for it. A single roam with no response from your team can completely fuck you. It can take away your TP advantage. It can snowball the game out of control.  If toplaners are going to get what little agency they already have removed then they need some type of system mechanic to make the lane itself less punishing. Otherwise why the fuck not just swap mid?
rbmseo,hnpex6v,hnpex6v,Teleport change in PBE,rathyAro,12/08/2021,0,Ive been suggesting this instead. Disable tp from base so it cant be used as a way to recall and come back to lane quickly. Then create a separate summoner that lets you buy items anywhere like ornn passive but also restores hp and mana like youre in base. That would be for Champs like kassadin and ekko who use to to survive lane.
rbmseo,hnppt7z,hnppt7z,Teleport change in PBE,elveszett,12/08/2021,1,tbh I love the objective system weve got. Ime at least it has greatly reduced the amount of games where you are stomping your enemy to the point it isnt even funny or are so behind that even playing perfectly will get you killed over and over. And most importantly it gives you actual goals to work towards when you are behind.  RIOT likes to do goffy things but this one is certainly a step in the right direction.
rbmseo,hnphsgg,hnphsgg,Teleport change in PBE,Mornos,12/08/2021,-1,How did it work the 10 years before that change? Besides that freezes are not really used mid/late game.   About the comeback mechanics: why is there a special mechanic that is specifically rewarding the losing team only? Comebacks should happen because the losing team plays a teamfight better or has better macro not because of artificial rewards. To make comebacks more likely they might as well lessen the strength of items or levels. Another way to make comebacks happen is to balance champs into categories of early/mid/late game champs. In recent years they went into the direction of making champs strong at all times of the game. Examples for this are the changes they made to Pantheon where they shifted his strength to late game.
rbmseo,hnq87nd,hnq87nd,Teleport change in PBE,Mornos,12/08/2021,1,It is ghosted because you can change the way minions arrive by body blocking them with your champ. Especially in mid lane you used to be able to set up a slow push from level 1 that would enable you to get first level 2 and 3. Bad change in my opinion.
rbmseo,hnqbnke,hnqbnke,Teleport change in PBE,Mornos,12/08/2021,1,I just looked this up because I didnt believe you but its true. wtf
rbmseo,hnpp0nh,hnpp0nh,Teleport change in PBE,Mornos,12/08/2021,2,I think you are right when you say that most players dont need to think about these mechanics and they just stay in the background of gameplay. But to me 2 problems arise from them.  1. The slippery slope: the only niche mechanics I can recall that they revoked was jungle exp rubberbanding. I believe right now there is no rubberbanding of jungle exp based on the level difference between junglers. Instead camps just give a flat amount of exp based on the time they spawned at. But I would have to look it up as they changed this mechanic numerous times and every time it changes people have to make up new strategies the roster of champs you can play in jungle changes completely and you have to change how you think about jungle pathing. For everything else they just keep adding those niche mechanics. It is getting a bit too much and the number just keeps increasing.   2. Making strategies: to make strategies you have to know all the games mechanics. Therefore to make a strategy you would need to look up and memories all the hidden mechanics that were introduced over the years. And there is a ton of them and this ton keeps changing patch by patch. Jungle exp is just one example. Making a strategy becomes really difficult for casual players and even at the pro level players just warm up to a certain state of the game and then it gets changed once again. This is especially true for jungle because the exp mechanics keep getting changed at least once per year. This makes for a really bad environment to make advanced strategies in. On top of that good strategies are nerfed through niche mechanics and riot does not have the patience to wait until counterplay to such strategies is discovered.
rbmseo,hnpppqq,hnpppqq,Teleport change in PBE,Mornos,12/08/2021,0,Forgot about this one. As you say these changes reduce the number of strategies available and to make a strategy you have to stay on top of all of them. I believe this kind of design is just bad game design.

rbmseo,hnpvfol,hnpvfol,Teleport change in PBE,Mornos,12/08/2021,1,The big minion in mid lane gives less gold than the big minions in top and bot wave (I believe that is before a certain time mark).   Another thing I just remembered is that for the first wave of mid lane minions there is no collision with your champion. But the collision works for all the other waves. The collision change was made because you used to be able to block the first wave of minions with your champ to bring them into a favourable position for a slow push that would allow you to gain level 3 first.  Now that I remember the collision mechanic
rbmseo,hnpvekh,hnpvekh,Teleport change in PBE,kirmerk1,12/08/2021,3,Where should I click to read about XP differences on lanes? Fan wikipedia and patch notes. This is not right at all.
rbmseo,hnpns8p,hnpns8p,Teleport change in PBE,Jiaozy,12/08/2021,2,Theyre adding random niche stuff on top of random niche stuff making it like a Jenga tower.  Just look at the scuttle changes: it snowballed so hard that we had the Scuttle meta for close to 2 seasons.  Rift Scuttler became too important for junglers making laners without pushing/roaming power less relevant requiring them to fix wave clear abilities and mana items requiring nerfs to many of the champs that became too dominat etc etc etc.  When you add too many small changes to band aid problems youre setting yourself up for disaster in the long run.
rbmseo,hnq2o92,hnq2o92,Teleport change in PBE,Mornos,12/08/2021,1,If it really was shitty there is no way it would be either popular or that people would come back to playing it after 10 years. One complaint with the design doesnt make the whole game bad.

All these years people on reddit told me that if you want to have impact as a toplaner you have to actually use your tp and leave your lane.

Had a game a few weeks ago where me and my AD stomped the enemy duo lane within the first minute of laning phase killed support and forced out all of their summoners level 2. The immediate response for being the better bot lane was our asses getting 4 man tower dived by fiddles and a full HP Kat at 3:40 into the game.  I checked the replay so I know that Kat didn’t just come back from base with teleport. The idiot playing mid didn’t harass her at all and allowed a kat to shove that early. If kat was any lower from lane harass me and my AD easily kill the kat in the 2v4 dive.  Our mid also had teleport but of course someone who doesn’t lane harass at all is someone who isn’t willing to be proactive in the game.  I can’t even be mad about my AD eventually trolling after the following 2v4 fights in our lane despite us still stomping the 2v2.

rbmseo,hnpi16i,hnpi16i,Teleport change in PBE,Tron_Impact,12/08/2021,-1,I mean the actual counterplay is not to push up to a point where they can tp behind you unless your mid laner is in a spot where they can stop the tp but that much communication in a game without voice chat is impossible.

rbmseo,hnq097v,hnq097v,Teleport change in PBE,DC_Flint,12/08/2021,7,When playing the most important lane in the game (simply because there are TWO players down there) you also have to live with the responsibilities of it.  I have to live with coinflips enough already.
rbmseo,hnpb1uj,hnpb1uj,Teleport change in PBE,MawrCalleach,12/08/2021,31,I get it but how do you now share your lead with your team as a toplaner?  (Really looking to learn am bronze)
rbmseo,hnp9cxm,hnp9cxm,Teleport change in PBE,CaptaineAli,12/08/2021,69,People who dont play every role have no idea how the game truly works. Yeah you can be an amazing top laner but if you dont play other lanes and know how they work youll never be amazing at the game. Even in pro play you see how beneficial it is when a player has roleswapped (xiahuo corejj etc).. or watching Canyon Faker or Showmaker play off-role is honestly awesome because you can tell theyve got experience in every role and it helps them with their main role.
rbmseo,hnpb2zz,hnpb2zz,Teleport change in PBE,DC_Flint,12/08/2021,180,I play both top and support as master+ level and not _once_ in the past seasons did I think yeah man top teleporting bot is unfair. Reddits rank is showing.  It simply is not a problem in soloq. Pretending it is is dishonest.   In high elo if you queue for toplane your queuetime is cut in half because no one wants to play it already because you might as well watch Netflix half the time you dont get to do shit. How DARE we try to impact the *actually important lane* **once** by giving up 3 plates and 3 waves to our lane opponent we filthy peasants should stay toplane and let the real players decide the game.   why yes I can gank all lanes at any given point in time why do you ask? - jungle / support players.  Prepare for a lot of shen in soloq my dudes. [Also this impacts way more than just teleporting bot](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/rbmseo/teleport_change_in_pbe/hnpbwby/)
rbmseo,hnpaiex,hnpaiex,Teleport change in PBE,dahl777,12/08/2021,1,yeah maybe in silver tbh. supports aggressively control bushs with sweepers and control wards bc they dont need to ward tri or river early bc they track junglers and look at the map. wards dont stay in bushes often or for long. and top and mids will tp on even waves bc they try to play towards win cons.
rbmseo,hnp7ggq,hnp7ggq,Teleport change in PBE,Toxic_Fkin_Noob,12/08/2021,-27,Bot lane is already the most important lane by a wide margin thats why being able to TP to it is crucial for having *any* impact on the game pre-15 minutes as the top laner. Might as well rename Top to Spectator if they go through with this change.

rbmseo,hnpmfhg,hnpmfhg,Teleport change in PBE,Pisholina,12/08/2021,1,As a bot lane player (both ADC and support) the point of the game is to adapt to the playstyle the enemy has. If the enemy top laner TPs to your lane and you didnt expect it thats on you.  My main issue are these gimmicky changes that force people to play a certain way. cant use TP normally until 14th minute cant hit top and mid tower in the first 5 minutes minions get stronger if the team is in the lead... Are all these changes really that necessary?

rbmseo,hnps8ty,hnps8ty,Teleport change in PBE,Lord-Babbled,12/08/2021,-1,If you as a player cant understand trading windows and positioning relative to the map state (i.e. dont trade too aggressively when the enemy top has the chance to tp because he slow pushed and crashed 3 waves onto your top tower) then you deserve to lose lp.

It is much more accurate to say that they are taking ignite instead of flash because most people take teleport but they can afford to forgo flash so they want to push an ignite advantage.
rbmseo,hnpxkjh,hnpxkjh,Teleport change in PBE,Kai_Lidan,12/08/2021,1,I see that more of a problem with how stupidly powerful flash is to the point that is basically mandatory on almost anyone. Teleport is the macro version of flash and theres nothing wrong for it to be as strong specially because the punishment for not managing to get anything meaningful from a teleport is huge losing 1-2 waves and suffering heavy damage to your tower.  Id much rather see variety in the summs than always flash+role appropiate spell.
rbmseo,hnpwrv5,hnpwrv5,Teleport change in PBE,IforgotmyAOLpassword,12/08/2021,0,Okay easy solution: tp has a team wide CD everyone can take it but only one person can tp at a time. Maybe have the lockout run next to the regular tp CD so its not one person perma spamming it.

The moment my support hits level 3 he fucks off to run circles around the jungler same with the enemy support and their ADC and me are staring at each other while farming waves. We cant kill each other unless one of us fucks up one gets the push but cant extend for plates else he dies to one of the three roamers aka mid/jg/support coming down and this is the state of botlane laning phase. winning botlane barely exists anymore other lanes tempo and vision are way more important than that 2v2.  Maybe with these changes botlane will become more important cause the ADC becomes more important in dragon/jungle fights when there is no random irelia/sett/whichever meta champ oneshotting you at level 6 when youre level 4.

rbmseo,hnpnzk8,hnpnzk8,Teleport change in PBE,Radiant_Shelter688,12/08/2021,-8,>rewarding good junglers who setup around dragon and mark the enemy’s    pathing while the bot duo carefully won the 2v2 so as to not lose lane    advantage.  You do realize your toplaner has TP too ? So he can follow. If he cant that means he TPd to lane to get CS advantage (Or took another summ to get laning power) and the enemy toplaner kept his TP and lost CS advantage in favor of map presence. This is something called strategy.  >Recall and move bot/drake earlier or cover mid while mid roams down  Yes just move down. And then lose CS XP and plates while moving. You already lose around 600 gold when TPing botlane you do realize that right ?  >Focus on winning your own lane  Just win toplane. They froze the wave ? Just crash it dude. You got dove at level 3 ? Just play safe dude. You got counter picked ? Just play better dude.  >If for some reason you’re losing top play safe in lane and play around the strong adc later  Yeah dude just coinflip your whole game.
rbmseo,hnq7sl3,hnq7sl3,Teleport change in PBE,Radiant_Shelter688,12/08/2021,1,TPing to lane is still an option because it offers lane advantage through XP and CS. A toplaner wont be able to TP 24/7 he has to have the wave shoved otherwise his laner will have immense CS and plates advantage and will roll over him once he comes back and even after shoving the wave he will at least lose a whole wave and a plate if the laner didnt follow him with his own TP.  >Top Laners dont understand how unfun it is to have your lane 100% decided by not the bot Lanes anymore.  Yes and botlaners dont understand how unfun it would be to have your entire game decided by everyone else except you. And I dont see how a toplaner TPing bot is any different from a jungler ganking you.
rbmseo,hnpsgj1,hnpsgj1,Teleport change in PBE,jailtonight,12/08/2021,8,Are we playing a different game? Bot lane complains the loudest about a losing top
rbmseo,hnpdepx,hnpdepx,Teleport change in PBE,Radiant_Shelter688,12/08/2021,8,A Toplaner winning lane means he gets an advantage on his opponent and possibly a Herald.  A Botlane winning means they get jungle prio (especially Drakes) and possibly mid prio since the support can roam freely. Snowballing into the enemy jungler not being safe in his own jungle and the midlaner having to care for a gank at all times since the support makes sure to get rid of enemy vision.
rbmseo,hnpxn8z,hnpxn8z,Teleport change in PBE,IforgotmyAOLpassword,12/08/2021,1,You will have 2 fed characters bot in that case that that will outweigh the fed enemy top.

rbmseo,hnpeg43,hnpeg43,Teleport change in PBE,zammouri2001,12/08/2021,15,Yet you do the same with junglers and midlaners. You cant watch for a 5 minute long sum that takes forever to channel? You play a super impactful role you dont get to just forget about your opponents.
rbmseo,hnpyv4i,hnpyv4i,Teleport change in PBE,Radiant_Shelter688,12/08/2021,3,Walking bot and TPing bot are two drastically different plays in terms of timing and tempo. No one in their right mind would take the risk of walking bot and not getting anything from it.

While the enemy toplaner might be 20-30 cs ahead Ive gotten 3-4 kill lead for my team just by showing up to skirmishes which happen so often in diamond.   I think saying TP should be used 99% of the time for your lane is a huge exaggeration and if it is true I think people need to stop doing that because its highly overrated.
rbmseo,hnpc37l,hnpc37l,Teleport change in PBE,screwmystepmom,12/08/2021,4,Its not though. Who says so you?   I get a lot of value out of it.   I think toplaners place way too much importance on farm. I play renekton who is a point and click stun bot whether hes 5/0 or 0/5.    I can give up a level and 30 CS to get my team ahead without feeling any sort of regret. And I know its best for the team.

Nowadays the entire pro play meta is super macro focused from minute 1. We saw in Worlds how people TP to bot lane in the early game all the time.  I think LoL is a more interesting esport if it tests different skills. The laning phase should imo be a huge test of individual skill. If you are better than the opponent it should *really* matter. Nowadays it definitely matters but I think it should matter more. With this change it will. Pro play will be completely different which Im stoked about.

rbmseo,hnq6m0y,hnq6m0y,Teleport change in PBE,Phemeth,12/08/2021,1,Not exactly:  - Top and mid tower have Fortification for the first 5 minutes taking 50% damage  - Plating give more and more AR/MR as they kep falling consecutively so its very unrealistic to take more then 2 platings unless youve set up the weave accordingly  - Ranged champions do 17% less damage to tower platings  All considered if the opponents TPs out at a bad moment weave wise nobody covers and the Top dies or doesnt come back realtively soon you can take up to 2 tower platings after minute 5 otherwise with a big weave well setup and a short top laner absence you can take up to 3 tower platings at once
rbmseo,hnpfoga,hnpfoga,Teleport change in PBE,C9sButthole,12/08/2021,1,TP was super powerful in mid because you could lose lane prio catch a huge wave shove into enemy tower and still TP bot/top to match your opponents roam before they even got there. Now youre far more punished in lanes that can out-shove you and your sidelanes will suffer.

rbmseo,hnp78ig,hnp78ig,Teleport change in PBE,-Quit,12/08/2021,-4,>I cant use it effectively in my solo queue games so its not a big change  But its true. This is not only about me and you can open every top lane stream and you will see the same thing. The cd on teleport is quite long and most of the time you wont even have it up when a fight at drag is happening.  You also dont gain that 600 gold. Rare occasions when that happens most of the time your team gets that and at the same time you are losing plates or even the entire tower and minions(gold and exp).  Since plates bot lane teleports have become very rare and it happens when the top laner is sure that it will gain something with minimal loss.

It scaling with player skill isnt necessarily bad whats bad is that its basically the only summoner spell to do so. A pro and a noob both use every other rune in a near identical way where as TP is used significantly differently.  Balancing should mean tuning things that are too strong/weak relative to other things of the same nature but when something like TP (or Ryze/ASol) is OP for one group of players and terrible for another group its just a nightmare for everyone.

rbmseo,hnq38q9,hnq38q9,Teleport change in PBE,Glaiele,12/08/2021,1,When udyr was meta I couldnt believe that no pro teams played anivia into it. Shes like the biggest counter to that champion walls and slows just shut udyr down so hard and if udyr flashes in you just cut off the rest of his team. Shes so good at objective control also makes team fighting super hard in the river and jungle entrances
rbmseo,hnpekwy,hnpekwy,Teleport change in PBE,In_It_2_Quinn_It,12/08/2021,292,Its a buff to eggnivia since she can tp during egg form in 4 secs instead of 4.5.

rbmseo,hnq4738,hnq4738,Teleport change in PBE,Hyperly_Passive,12/08/2021,1,Shen doesnt not really
rbmseo,hnq5u3r,hnq5u3r,Teleport change in PBE,Silly_Asparagus,12/08/2021,1,Well teleport was basically taken by every solo laner all the time so from the point of view of pro play this is good will probably encourage more agressive laning bot
rbmseo,hnq6ta8,hnq6ta8,Teleport change in PBE,Kunzzi1,12/08/2021,1,I think I meant homeguard the movement buff which activates upon entering/leaving your fountain given to you if you die in first 20 minutes and then just to everyone afterwards. It used to be an enchantment on your boots you could buy as an upgrade but now its just a build in passive called something else.  It is an extremely annoying bullshit which punishes players who won a 1v1 without access to TP. If I played a Trynda and won 1v1 by picking ghost or ignite I was getting basically punished for a won duel as the enemy top would respawn in 10 seconds and could tp directly onto minion wave with activated homeguard effect (although this doesnt work anymore with tp since 11.6 as TP itself now gives you a movement speed bonus the result is the same though) which meant the only way to survive was to recall asap after won duel which could lead to really shitty wave positions & being behind in level even after a kill lead because youd have to walk back while the enemy top got 1 or 2 waves over you.   This change is massive.
rbmseo,hnph1q3,hnph1q3,Teleport change in PBE,KCKrimson,12/08/2021,69,I personally think that tp isnt that good on nasus at least not enough to give up flash ghost. Most nasus onetricks run flash ghost (except can1ne who runs phase rush).
rbmseo,hnpjxu5,hnpjxu5,Teleport change in PBE,AalfredWilibrordius,12/08/2021,2,Yeah if you want to play to get carried. If you want to make an impact in teamfights ghost/flash is the way.
rbmseo,hnpf1lc,hnpf1lc,Teleport change in PBE,BudgetFar380,12/08/2021,1,Ghost TP Nasus since the slow is so much?
rbmseo,hnpnwtb,hnpnwtb,Teleport change in PBE,SignificantSample,12/08/2021,1,If he takes it he is unlikely to tp to anything but his own turret for the first 14 minutes anyway.
rbmseo,hnpu4so,hnpu4so,Teleport change in PBE,trixon221,12/08/2021,1,If you dont take ghost as Nasus do you really play Nasus?
rbmseo,hnpzwmj,hnpzwmj,Teleport change in PBE,ArziltheImp,12/08/2021,1,Well he loves TP early to get back to lane. Lategame it‘s the same spell basically.
rbmseo,hnplz6b,hnplz6b,Teleport change in PBE,zepolen,12/08/2021,1,TP to enemy tower 5head.
rbmseo,hnq05ph,hnq05ph,Teleport change in PBE,tanezuki,12/08/2021,1,>a problem i see is nasus will have a harder time stacking. if enemy tps bot and doesn’t get    >   >too much   >   > you sitting and stacking for a minute or two really helps you transition to the part of the game where you stat-check kill everybody.  Lmao they never do that vs me they just stay on the lane to try to hard bully.
rbmseo,hnpmczn,hnpmczn,Teleport change in PBE,Magicslime,12/08/2021,21,No OPs point is that this is good for Darius and Trynd because they already didnt go TP whereas current TP users are nerfed. But the reply is pointing out that this is actually bad for Darius because ignite is stronger against him and now more people will be incentivized to take it.
rbmseo,hnpkopr,hnpkopr,Teleport change in PBE,Snoo8331100,12/08/2021,27,Trynd I can understand but Darius can be kinda bullied rn by many lethal tempo users early especially when you take ignite.
rbmseo,hnpmzrj,hnpmzrj,Teleport change in PBE,RealRadya,12/08/2021,10,As a riven player I always take ignite and destroy Darius in lane lol
rbmseo,hnpoeu6,hnpoeu6,Teleport change in PBE,bman10_33,12/08/2021,2,I personally find exhaust to be way more a trynd counter on a lot of champs tbh. It buys the extra time to wait out his ult so easily in a lane 1v1
rbmseo,hnpnpx3,hnpnpx3,Teleport change in PBE,Ninjahound789,12/08/2021,4,Ignite is pretty good into both of those champs actually. Both depend on healing and dish out damage kind of slowly at the start but benefit immensely from extended trades which ignite directly counters.  Trynds ult in particular is easier to play around when you have ignite and you can generate a 1v1 lead against him early on with the added kill pressure
rbmseo,hnppbrf,hnppbrf,Teleport change in PBE,parwa,12/08/2021,1,I havent played in a while but why is this? When I played it was pretty common to take ignite against Trynd to kill him when his ult is out
rbmseo,hnpj1rx,hnpj1rx,Teleport change in PBE,Praxyrnate,12/08/2021,0,Why is that? I usually just run ww into them but why is ignite specifically bad?
rbmseo,hnqdeai,hnqdeai,Teleport change in PBE,ProEngineer3000,12/08/2021,1,>I am against changes that are inconsistent and hard to read  Eh I dont think this will be that much of an issue in that regard since:  1. The icon of the spell changes 2. Since it happens when turret plating falls you get a pretty clear indicator of when it will be upgraded
rbmseo,hnpxo7a,hnpxo7a,Teleport change in PBE,jonydevidson,12/08/2021,42,So dramatic
rbmseo,hnq3k5g,hnq3k5g,Teleport change in PBE,isabimbo,12/08/2021,1,They cant do whole game cause how are top laners supposed to tp to dragon or baron fights the turret is too far away.  The change to only turrets is terrible though just leave it as it is
rbmseo,hnpyqjm,hnpyqjm,Teleport change in PBE,pereza0,12/08/2021,5,I agree honestly. Towers Wards  and Minions should be it IMO (because otherwise it would become too useless once the map is often).   Champ pets and objects should not be an option
rbmseo,hnq47lp,hnq47lp,Teleport change in PBE,Fearlessmojo,12/08/2021,1,>Having a summoners spell drastically change behaviour mid game because you cant balance it otherwise is just lazy and TERRIBLE game design  What? how does this make any sense. Do you even know what game design is?
rbmseo,hnqjbdu,hnqjbdu,Teleport change in PBE,Somebodys,12/08/2021,1,I quit for 4 years and came back at the start of season 11. The game is still fundamentally the same. There is definitely a learning ingredient curve but it honestly isnt bad. The biggest hump for a returning player is getting mechanics back.
rbmseo,hnpzby1,hnpzby1,Teleport change in PBE,deadxdolly,12/08/2021,1,I thought that was Riots whole deal ?
rbmseo,hnq4aik,hnq4aik,Teleport change in PBE,theycallmeAleri,12/08/2021,1,Lol delete this comment my guy
rbmseo,hnq7z40,hnq7z40,Teleport change in PBE,ACAnalyst,12/08/2021,1,Agree theyve done this before like making top tower tankier than bot to stop lane swapping. The game should be consistent and uniform just lazy balancing cause they cant figure out a clean way of doing it. Assume their objective was to stop flank TPs on bot lane so they can pressure lane more agressively which does seem a tricky fix. Either they do as you say only towers which basically destroys TP or they make the cost of using an early TP greater. Could have a semi ineligant solution of TP CD scaling with time/level like points in ulti. Then you could still do it but kaybe your early game CD for tp s really big so you only get one... I dont see an obvious fix tbh save ruining TP. Maybe they add one of those hex gates from top to bot and delete TP entirely would drastically shake up top play and make split pushing stronger buy potentially riskier.
rbmseo,hnq3z3r,hnq3z3r,Teleport change in PBE,MonstrousGiggling,12/08/2021,1,So the last time I had consistently played was before Yuumi was released I think maybe when Senna released? Theyve changed so much shit since then. Arcane got me back into the game but I only play ARAMS and occasionally a random summoners rift match because so much shit has changed and is constantly changing. Its annoying and doesnt make me go Wow I really want to relearn every little thing in this game!
rbmseo,hnq616p,hnq616p,Teleport change in PBE,WonderBrood,12/08/2021,1,Imagine coming back to the game after 3 years and having to deal with a change like that? Itll be tough but at least there arent other drastic changes to the game and the game and everything else about the map is static throughout..
rbmseo,hnpek9b,hnpek9b,Teleport change in PBE,Random_Stealth_Ward,12/08/2021,123,Imagine complaining about people crying about Zac then say in a game full of Yone
rbmseo,hnpdhwy,hnpdhwy,Teleport change in PBE,Erknaite,12/08/2021,26,Everyone crying about Zac is below plat or some shit its not hard to play against him at all and no its not bias.  If your champ has low mobility good chances they have items that boost your movement speed or they have abilities that cancel dashes XD  For a reason he has a super low banrate
rbmseo,hnpi3dn,hnpi3dn,Teleport change in PBE,Phloof_,12/08/2021,1,Camille and Yuumi have been nerfed hard recently Yone still a problem tho

rbmseo,hnq127y,hnq127y,Teleport change in PBE,Foogie23,12/08/2021,1,I hate Zac because his ganking range is insane. In solo queue it is so hard to keep a ward deep enough to see him coming if you are botside.   But I do hate those 3 champs as well.
rbmseo,hnqfz5v,hnqfz5v,Teleport change in PBE,Two_Years_Of_Semen,12/08/2021,1,TBH I have more problems against Zac than any of those. I could dodge his jump all day but it feels like theres no getting away from his tether thing.

rbmseo,hnpo8h4,hnpo8h4,Teleport change in PBE,Key_Rate_9245,12/08/2021,3,you nailed it on the head. Zac has insane range and if he hits you the chances of you blowing flash is pretty big. so the way you play against it is like rammus. instead of warding areas where you know you cant run from him. try warding further out. like entrances to your side of the jungle and once you see him. play at a safe spot. Once he leaves your side of the jungle you can play aggressive. Zacs biggest weakness is his biggest strength. if he cant hit you with his e hes borderline useless. other jungles you can get away with warding tri bush.

rbmseo,hnq2z6h,hnq2z6h,Teleport change in PBE,NO_FNX_NO_MAJOR,12/08/2021,1,It was for all season last year just look at winrates and quite a few zac OTPs I saw high elo had arguments for it. I understand if you disagree now but why the question marks like its not even up for debate? Thats where youre completely wrong.
rbmseo,hnqe2wr,hnqe2wr,Teleport change in PBE,AnxiousEzrael,12/08/2021,1,Youre acting like he wont just TP back to his turret and run it down. He might be slower by a second or two though
rbmseo,hnpyy6e,hnpyy6e,Teleport change in PBE,Sea-Selection-399,12/08/2021,5,nah hell just TP to the enemy turret instead.
rbmseo,hnpb0tm,hnpb0tm,Teleport change in PBE,PureImbalance,12/08/2021,308,Its part of the game. If you want to abuse the enemy botlane tell your toplaner to watch out for the TP and countergank. If youre winning bot and they are even top you should be able to win the 3v3. If your toplaner had to blow TP early or took ignite youll have to respect that simple.    This change just reduces strategic complexity favouring lower skill expression.
rbmseo,hnpbn77,hnpbn77,Teleport change in PBE,EldtinbGamer,12/08/2021,231,How dare a toplaner try to have some sort of influence in the game by impacting the by far most important lane closest to the by far most impacting objective.
rbmseo,hnppljt,hnppljt,Teleport change in PBE,PursueSomeBitches,12/08/2021,10,Oh no its frustrating therefore it should be removed. Lets do away with csing too very frustrating to be down in gold :(

rbmseo,hnps0f7,hnps0f7,Teleport change in PBE,evandrew,12/08/2021,1,You can sweep the lane behind you before you push. A lot of pros do this in solo queue.
rbmseo,hnpvhy1,hnpvhy1,Teleport change in PBE,Hue__hue,12/08/2021,1,it’s also super frustrating as a top laner to lose game because of hard botlane diff. top has the least impact on the game already it’s a stupid nerf
rbmseo,hnq68h9,hnq68h9,Teleport change in PBE,Antenoralol,12/08/2021,1,Its super frustrating stepping up for 1 second and the enemy mid/top are both tping on you at 5 mins.

rbmseo,hnpnylc,hnpnylc,Teleport change in PBE,ComputerScienceLover,12/08/2021,-4,You either dont play top lane/never bothered to learn or you just trolling.  Top lane is the wave management lane the same way a support needs to learn good ward spots and good roam timers. Not to get chall just to play the game RIGHT. A good top laner isnt someone who kills his laner in a pure 1v1 but he who plays the lane in that way that gets an advantage either way.   tldr: ignite is for pussies nolifers who love trynd bonking with no thought
rbmseo,hnpvvbj,hnpvvbj,Teleport change in PBE,pereza0,12/08/2021,1, > And ignite is an overpowered summoner and has been this entire season.  *citation needed*   It seems riot considers TP more of a problem.

rbmseo,hnqiamf,hnqiamf,Teleport change in PBE,licorices,12/08/2021,1,So they have to commit to walking down a lane and trying to do a gank/roam for dragon compared to TPing when the action happens which is a lot safer in terms of committing? Its very different. The fact that you have to walk to a lane for 25-30s and then hope the stuff aligns instead of instantaneously be able to join a fight in 45s is a huge difference.
rbmseo,hnq6jjo,hnq6jjo,Teleport change in PBE,Far-Abroad8185,12/08/2021,1,Top laners nearly all of the 1v9 power fantasy champions reside in this lane and any time any change threatens their ability to completely ignore every aspect of the game except mechanics they throw a fit.

Always crying about not having enough impact while they can oneshot us from 3 walls away being 0 4 (camille). Being 4 man dived on bot is one of the most disgusting things and I am frankly glad that this will be less easy due to the tp changes.

rbmseo,hnq4i16,hnq4i16,Teleport change in PBE,Mysterious-Bear,12/08/2021,1,Tbh I kinda feel like that’s what Wild Rift is. They will eventually just turn Wild Rift into league 2.0.
rbmseo,hnpse53,hnpse53,Teleport change in PBE,froggison,12/08/2021,7,Yeah seriously per the Wiki:  > Passive - Bulwark: When a turret has its health reduced to 4000 3000 2000 and 1000 health it gets a stack of Bulwark for 20 seconds. Each stack grants 0 − 180 (based on nearby enemy champions) bonus armor and bonus magic resistance up to a maximum of 0 − 720 (based on nearby enemy champions) resistances at 4 stacks. This value changes dynamically depending on the number of alive enemy champions within 850 range of the center of the turret.  So does that mean in botlane that I can take the turret faster if my enchanter support stands back? And also ranged champs do less damage to turrets? So many things that are just never explained.
rbmseo,hnq0tkx,hnq0tkx,Teleport change in PBE,Soulrealz,12/08/2021,0,then u havent been reading patch notes or simply forgot about it when you first read it

rbmseo,hnqazra,hnqazra,Teleport change in PBE,Vivid_Conflict_6742,12/08/2021,1,The solution is to let players find the counters and not just patch them instantly. If league mechanics existed more than only 2 weeks and people actually had time to analyze them the player base itself would have come up with real solutions. Like how the lane swap and fast push meta from back in like Season 4 was countered by Korean teams figuring out they can just freeze the lane.   Its like the Tetris competition just earlier this year where records are being broken because the players found out a new way to hold the controller and not because Nintendo released a patch that changed how the pieces move or whatever.

You just sit there and turret race where both solo laners just afk under tower and soak xp while both duo lanes wail away at the tower. Not fun to play and definitely not fun to watch.
rbmseo,hnpls49,hnpls49,Teleport change in PBE,Salmon_Slap,12/08/2021,5,They have a solution. I dont think giving a turrer less armour than the other turrets really counts as a niche mechanic.
rbmseo,hnpothc,hnpothc,Teleport change in PBE,Ninjahound789,12/08/2021,7,Herald is stronger than the first drake by a large margin and the second herald matches the second drake in power. Dragons become very important at 15 minutes or later so a role swap meta would definitely come back if the tower armor is gone
rbmseo,hnpst9q,hnpst9q,Teleport change in PBE,PiBiscuit,12/08/2021,1,To add to what u/Ninjahound789 said:  Yes if you swap you give up first drake. But with Herald you can guarantee to either get second drake or get midlane turret which would result open the map for them and I would argue almost guarantee for them to get  all other drakes
rbmseo,hnpsgy6,hnpsgy6,Teleport change in PBE,PiBiscuit,12/08/2021,2,?  Remind me again: Which team is more likely to get first turret gold?  The team which has access to drake or the team which has access to herald?
rbmseo,hnpprx1,hnpprx1,Teleport change in PBE,Felkin,12/08/2021,9,Getting back to lane using TP feels more like a bandaid than what the goal of TP is. A death leading to losing 2 plates and 2 waves is a design issue with the game itself. So if they were to remove TP obviously it would come with a change to top lane to severely lower the impact of a death for example earlier homeguarding to toplane tankier top turret etc.
rbmseo,hnpm8fb,hnpm8fb,Teleport change in PBE,dosjndxux,12/08/2021,0,And then your botlane pays the price for your mistake instead of you. How healthy of a game mechanic isnt it
rbmseo,hnpd8b7,hnpd8b7,Teleport change in PBE,Jozoz,12/08/2021,-14,Im sure theres something you could do to alleviate that issue. In fact Id say perhaps TP is just a band-aid thats masking this exact issue that needs to be addressed?

rbmseo,hnppj24,hnppj24,Teleport change in PBE,Ninjahound789,12/08/2021,5,Comeback mechanics are needed because League is extremely punishing. Falling behind in gold leads to the enemies having more room to face check to set up vision in your jungle and to allocate resources differently than in an even game. Even with perfect macro a team that is behind would take forever to recover an advantage against a decent-good enemy team without comeback mechanics.  Forcing identities on champions is never that great. Having a few champions with terrible scaling like Renekton and a few with insane scaling like Kayle is fine but a champion like Pantheon is bound to come where his early game is strong but not enough to justify his laughable late game so instead they nerfed the early game a little and compensated with a significantly stronger late game making his early game moderately powerful and his late game good.  Gwen has most of her power shifted to the late game but she isnt an instant win like Kayle or Kassadin so the result is a very lackluster champion that is fun but objectively never the right choice. This is often the result when you design a champion with a scaling orientation in mind and try to stick to it closely
rbmseo,hnpq6nv,hnpq6nv,Teleport change in PBE,elveszett,12/08/2021,2,> is to balance champs into categories of early/mid/late game champs  I hate this idea. It makes the game not fun at all by amplifying factors you have no control over. Its not fun to lose your lane just because the enemy champion is so ridiculously strong that it can steamroll you by punching the keyboard. Its also not fun to be 7/0 play better and still lose a fight because its min 30 now and your champ is no longer useful and its Twitchs time now.  Having a stronger early or a stronger late should be part of the weaknesses and strengths of certain champions of course but it shouldnt be something so drastic as to categorize champs into early mid and late and have them excel in their category and suck in the rest like it was the case with some champs in the past.  At the end of the day this is still a game and you still need to have fun playing rather than feel like you need a degree in mechanical engineering to optimize the best procedure.
rbmseo,hnq8qh9,hnq8qh9,Teleport change in PBE,shrubs311,12/08/2021,1,>About the comeback mechanics: why is there a special mechanic that is specifically rewarding the losing team only?  because unlike in football if you do well early in league it makes future plays easier for you. so if two teams were equally skilled if one team makes a single mistake then the game is over because how can someone beat an equally skilled opponent who also is straight up stronger than you? it would take a miracle play and those kinds of miracle plays are special because theyre extremely rare.  so instead we have comeback mechanics to balance out the snowball mechanics

Sure TPing at the right moment was the most powerful thing to do before so powerful that it became the only thing to master to have an impact (Im exagerating it to make a point).

The way it is now if your Top has already TPed back to lane well you just cant try anything bot because the enemy Top will TP on you and destroy you.

Do objectives i remember in bronze after  a teamfight they recalled instead of doing objectives remember that sometimes you simply cant contest objectives and is better to look for other things to do on the map  Never let your enemy do something for free  As a top laner coordinate with your jungler for a first herald the first herald is better than the first dragon and is a way you can impact the map.
rbmseo,hnppbj2,hnppbj2,Teleport change in PBE,Maloonyy,12/08/2021,5,By soaking pressure. Go splitpush if youre stronger than the enemy top laner then they need to send 2 people or their strongest player to deal with you giving your team a favorable team fight.

If you’re ahead as a top laner you more than likely can take the game over and it doesn’t matter what happened on the rest of the map. Top laners exchange their agency for having the strongest champions in the game.

As long as drakes are as powerful as they are and herald is this hard to solo + low impact toplane will always be an irrelevant role for the first 20 minutes.

rbmseo,hnpmfu8,hnpmfu8,Teleport change in PBE,BradL_13,12/08/2021,2,I don’t play top but I watch a bunch of challenger elo top streamers and they don’t even TP bot every game. If it was so op it would be happening every single game. It’s super risky with how volatile top is if you tp and get 2 assists you’ve lost 2-3 waves and possibly tower by the time you’re back to top.   I think mid laners ability to roam without tp and still make it back to catch their wave is more oppressive. (Not saying it needs changed)
rbmseo,hnpcntg,hnpcntg,Teleport change in PBE,Leandermann,12/08/2021,-3,The thing is it makes variance as a botlaner bigger. You can destroy the enemy botlane as much as you want and be better but a good enemy with tp makes it much harder. I cant count how often i had 2 teleports from the same toplaner to botlane pre 15 minutes which won the other botlane the game.   For a botlaner who most of the time wins his lane 2v2 this change is great.

rbmseo,hnqexox,hnqexox,Teleport change in PBE,azersub,12/08/2021,1,Idk in my expirience if top laner wins his lane and gets fed i cant do shit against him as adc before 35/40 mins even when i dominate lane.  And top lane being borning is top laners  fault. In mid or bot even when i die 1 or 2 times opponents are willing to fight and i  feel like i can win while in top if you die once it is pretty much done. You ther get freezed or top champs are just too cancerous to da anything against them.

It happens every game and what you are saying is correct but puts the burden of villigance and unfun gameplay on two people instead of one - pressing tp and going brrrr on ur lvl 6+ bruiser for a double kill every time its up does not take a macro genius does it now?
rbmseo,hnp9llz,hnp9llz,Teleport change in PBE,SSGKCMDarkBetty,12/08/2021,15,Not necessarily. This can also be awful for those champs. As someone who plays a good amount of twitch and kog last season these champs dont have many winning matchups and can be choked out of lane pretty easily. This is a two-way nerf. Your team cant bail you out as easily and the enemy team cant abuse you as easily either.   Imo this will exacerbate or at the very least highlight weaknesses in specific bot lane matchups. I dont think the tp change really impaacts Kayle kassadin in the same way though.  E.g. poke lanes hard counter kog + lulu and now a varus karma lane can sit in front of your tower with less threat to them overall (obv excluding jungle influence)
rbmseo,hnpc14z,hnpc14z,Teleport change in PBE,AliceInHololand,12/08/2021,12,It’s dominated by “carries” because tanks are shit in soloqueue.
rbmseo,hnp7tq2,hnp7tq2,Teleport change in PBE,VindicoAtrum,12/08/2021,31,This is why TP is being nerfed. Any meta +2 level bruiser ruins bot lane fights. Its an unfair slaughter if they TP to a brush ward theres no counterplay (except the other top laner also TP to bot and coinflip it) for a lvl5 adc + lvl5 support when a lvl7 bruiser TPs behind you you just get crunched and die. Your enemies get 6 before you get back to lane.  Im in agreement with this change. 14 mins is fine give bot lane some ability to actually play without two lane enemies one jungler and an overleveled bruiser bomb dropping at 9 mins.
rbmseo,hnpsssh,hnpsssh,Teleport change in PBE,Huzzl3,12/08/2021,2,> dominated by carries popularity-wise  Thats always the case even when tanks were batshit fucking OP and not picking one was trolling people still played carries because they enjoyed them more. That doesnt mean tanks are bad or carries are the better class...
rbmseo,hnpk6l3,hnpk6l3,Teleport change in PBE,ColorfulThoughts,12/08/2021,1,It certainly isn’t dead in Proplay as we have just witnessed worlds where the most important carry-role was toplane with an average dmgshare of 30% and highest goldshare.  Soloq might be a different beast but this nerf screams competitive to me.
rbmseo,hnpfqk2,hnpfqk2,Teleport change in PBE,Th_Call_of_Ktulu,12/08/2021,5,Exactly tp is still too important if you want to splitpush later on and it can bail you out of some rought matchups by allowing to recall get a big powerspike item and tp righ back to your lane
rbmseo,hnpc3p2,hnpc3p2,Teleport change in PBE,papu16,12/08/2021,19,People who talk that tp is free lead never played toplane... Have they played against literally any non tank toplaner? If you Leaving lane with tp = enemy gonna get at least 500g from plates+ minions. Sometimes even more.
rbmseo,hnpbfga,hnpbfga,Teleport change in PBE,Snoo8331100,12/08/2021,1,Ignite or the lack of it doesnt make top lane counter match ups any better or worse tbh. If youre countered your only hope is to have a better jungler or a boosted opponent.
rbmseo,hnpc3a9,hnpc3a9,Teleport change in PBE,Blank-612,12/08/2021,0,That should be good for top lane mains because they get to roll anyone who doesnt have as much laning experience/skill as them
rbmseo,hnpcrwp,hnpcrwp,Teleport change in PBE,DingoThBOY,12/08/2021,-1,But that’s a part of every lane at least this gets rid of players coin flipping games at 5 minutes with cross map tps that are barely ever worth it
rbmseo,hnpcg8p,hnpcg8p,Teleport change in PBE,Umarill,12/08/2021,0,You can influence the map as much as you currently can post 14min which is when youll start effectively split pushing.  Its only a change before that doesnt affect split pushers thatll want to TP back in lane to accumulate ressources and be a threat later on.

rbmseo,hnpsaor,hnpsaor,Teleport change in PBE,Kirigaya_Yuumi,12/08/2021,8,unironically yes getting enchanter supports ahead has always been a sure-fire way to help carry games (obviously with at least one carry being fed). we obviously saw this at its advent during ardent meta but it still rings true today ever since the s10 item overhaul with the heal&shield stat items being busted.  that’s not even beginning to mention the fact that an ahead support can effect the map easier and faster essentially being a 2nd jungler
rbmseo,hnpzol2,hnpzol2,Teleport change in PBE,JustJohnItalia,12/08/2021,2,if top and adc both suck because of jungle and support being too impactful how is the answer to nerf toplane?  Adc are fine its a good class and got plenty of overtuned tools this season (namely LDR galeforce and shieldbow). They are not weak botlane is. Almost any champion could be put bot and do as bad as an adc if not worse. Support/Jungle are just too strong and duo exp is too bad that has nothing to do with the class.  Nerf support nerf jungle and the game will be healthier. Support and jungle (and toplane depending on the elo) are all picked less than jungle so lets not start talking about queue times and all.

rbmseo,hnpciol,hnpciol,Teleport change in PBE,JustJohnItalia,12/08/2021,25,I fail to see how jungler would think to themselves you know what? Now that toplane is even less useful and mid/top cant tp bot to interfere with my ganks which makes it much easier to make them work I think I will stop focusing on botlane. Yeah let me go and gank my toplaner. Maybe hell be useful once I see him 20 minutes down the line
rbmseo,hnpe2tg,hnpe2tg,Teleport change in PBE,Radiant_Shelter688,12/08/2021,3,You dont gank bot because of teamfights you gank bot because it gives Drakes and bot prio snowballing into free roaming for your support to get your mid ahead too and harass the enemy jungler.
rbmseo,hnpb8x4,hnpb8x4,Teleport change in PBE,The-Devilz-Advocate,12/08/2021,12,You are acting as if there arent 5 bushes to clear + minions that have to be checked.  Blue side drag bush. River Bush and the 3 lane bushes.
rbmseo,hnpcwgd,hnpcwgd,Teleport change in PBE,throwawayfinggra,12/08/2021,2,well i mean if it was that easy sure. you are often getting pushed in and your jungler comes for a gankl and you engage - you didnt have time to sweep yet.  Also you can tp on minions. supporter / adc can drop wards the moment you engage. there are more than 3 brushes and if the lane is kinda even you can not just walk up and clear all the wards with a red trinket
rbmseo,hnqdydm,hnqdydm,Teleport change in PBE,Senko_san123,12/08/2021,1,No no you didn’t
rbmseo,hnqe2cz,hnqe2cz,Teleport change in PBE,Waxburg,12/08/2021,1,I think youre leaving out some pretty important details here cause theres no way a level 3 jungler with only his jg item and (maybe) and HP pot beat a 3 kill top solo thats actually backed and returned with the items he would have been able to afford. Only way I could see this happening is if he roamed to that 3rd kill and killed you while you were already low which is 100% fair on his part and thats on you for not realizing what side he started or if he was playing a jungler which is abnormally strong early and cheesed you but once again kinda your fault for not even knowing where he starts.  btw 3 kills literally dont mean anything if you dont back and actually use the gold you earned from them. Just having 3 kills alone doesnt mean you deserve to kill them unless youve actually used that 3 kills worth of gold.
rbmseo,hnpv1y0,hnpv1y0,Teleport change in PBE,MarcosLuisP97,12/08/2021,12,And you think a losing bot lane will not be a free double kill + dragon + enemy support that goes wherever he wants when losing?  Bot lane isnt some magical place where counter picks do not exist and all strategy goes to waste. A behind ADC is literally a caster minion and you contribute even less to fights than a top lane ever would and a behind support that cant deep ward and roam is basically giving the enemy free access to the entire map.
rbmseo,hnq4a23,hnq4a23,Teleport change in PBE,NSawsome,12/08/2021,1,If you tp bot to match when pushed in you insta lose lane that’s not how tps work tping bot with a good wave state like a good player however loses maybe 2 waves and a plate and if they can’t clear or hit tower enough only a wave or two which you can make up with a kill or a drag or even by taxing bot wave. When losing you won’t be carrying anyways so you’re already coin flipping and if you get dove then either your jg plays for bot and gets something or you lose that’s how a team game works. If they freeze call jg to break and if they don’t break pray they gank bot instead or play for drag again that’s how a strategy based team game works
rbmseo,hnqcplv,hnqcplv,Teleport change in PBE,sceptic62,12/08/2021,1,It’s not strategy to get your tp burnt early lmao.  If you’re in an ass early matchup like 90% of counter picks most junglers are straight up willing to dive you level 3 to kill your ass.  I think this past season I dove a malphite or saw a malphite get dove at level 3 almost every game it was in lmao
rbmseo,hnpugqp,hnpugqp,Teleport change in PBE,V_Dudez,12/08/2021,1,Yes my top laner has tp. That was part of the problem. This change is being implemented to stop bot lane becoming a 5v5 party 7 minutes into the game.   Yes you lose xp/cs/plates if you walk down just the same as when you tp down. Ever thought about using tp back up to top after the roam though?  Focus on your lane is the same statement applied to all lanes and it’s still very valid. You can always improve your own play and are in control of your own play. Freezes counter picks dives are all part of the game but they don’t insta lose you the game. Learn how to play into these things rather than giving up on lane completely. Stem the bleeding.   Coinflipping the game is exactly what solo queue is. The view you have about bot is the same that bot has for the solo lanes and jungler has to pray that not every lane loses. Open your mind and learn to look at the game from all 5 players pov
rbmseo,hnq93v4,hnq93v4,Teleport change in PBE,NfinityBored,12/08/2021,1,So why not have it where both tops can just save tp for lane. That way you dont have to play the game of is this tp worth or not or losing tower because of a failed tp. You get to play lane phase with less risk and bot lane gets to actually play lane phase.   Bot Lanes do understand because games usually end before we get to do anything anyway. Its usually a fed top mid or jungle that ends the game by wiping team fights while we are still shooting peanuts at them. If anyone understands losing a game that is out of your control its ADC players.   Its different from a jungle gank because a jungle gank is one person usually coming in from vision. While tp cant really be seen that well if its coming from behind and can sometimes even be two people coming in. Its also usually saved for when the dive is already happening. So you have to either finish the dive and then die to the top or abandon the dive and have their bot retaliate on you as you run away making it an auto loss for the bot lane who was playing aggressively. This on top of jungle ganks makes everyone else in the game have more pressure on bot lane than bot laners.  This change allows Laners to be aggressive and actually show skill expression in lane instead of an enemy bot getting tp saved and the aggressive bot be punished and now lose lane.
rbmseo,hnq4ffl,hnq4ffl,Teleport change in PBE,NSawsome,12/08/2021,1,Idk I only complain about a losing top when my jg is pathing there and they still lose lmao

rbmseo,hnpk5fy,hnpk5fy,Teleport change in PBE,Hydraplayshin,12/08/2021,2,You can walk into the enemy jgl if u are ahead as a top laner and u can one shot him. U cant do that as winning bot :)
rbmseo,hnpgljk,hnpgljk,Teleport change in PBE,DragonPeakEmperor,12/08/2021,22,Do these people just pretend like mid/jungle doesnt exist and they dont already have to do this especially when junglers can literally gank from bush? Half this thread is people acting like its a chore to prioritize vision.
rbmseo,hnpf6xp,hnpf6xp,Teleport change in PBE,F-b,12/08/2021,-5,You dont understand because you probably dont play bot. What this guy asking is unrealistic as fuck. The resources for vision control are very limited in the early game and the entire area to clear is fucking massive. You cant sweep every potential ward spot. Even if you do enemy laners can ward right after youre done.   Youre forced to make very tough choices on your vision investment. Sometimes its the jungler that requires more vision sometimes its simply the enemys support. Right now you can perfectly play the vision game and still get fucked.  Anyway its pointless to argue about outplay potential. Riot saw the problem and fixed it.
rbmseo,hnppur0,hnppur0,Teleport change in PBE,Maloonyy,12/08/2021,-2,Well damn I guess you should tell all these braindead proplayer supports they constantly lose to a TP. You figured it all out though.
rbmseo,hnq38hv,hnq38hv,Teleport change in PBE,DanielsDraven,12/08/2021,1,So don’t play the game if enemy has Tp got it. When top/mid brings tp and hold it for bot do I just get to never play my lane? God forbid I do anything more then farm for 20 minutes and throw out any play making opportunities because the enemy top laner has tp.
rbmseo,hnpq49r,hnpq49r,Teleport change in PBE,BradL_13,12/08/2021,14,you will only split push and you will like it
rbmseo,hnpyg0k,hnpyg0k,Teleport change in PBE,trapsinplace,12/08/2021,3,Bro just walk to other lanes. Im an ass laner at top and I play Shen. If I am losing hard and they freeze at tower I just walk bot lane or mid and we get kills/dragon. I can ult top onto mid or jungle for a 2v1 once the enemy breaks the freeze.  Just walk to other lanes and use TP to get back top. You dont need to TP to bot to get agank off. Shit was OP as fuck and we all know it. Same reason people bitch about Shen ult except everyone has it.
rbmseo,hnp9n9a,hnp9n9a,Teleport change in PBE,Blank-612,12/08/2021,18,It means that riot wants to cater to core playstyle of the role which is more of 1v1 isolated brawling. Top is the pinnacle of laning skill because they have a long lane with an unforgiving laning phase. They cant please everyone but TP has been a core of toplane for more than 5 years now and honestly it was a get out of jail free card.
rbmseo,hnq4k2e,hnq4k2e,Teleport change in PBE,NO_FNX_NO_MAJOR,12/08/2021,1,just ignore this thread man people just like to state points to make themselves sound smart. No shit support can roam better than toplane just do you.
rbmseo,hnpakke,hnpakke,Teleport change in PBE,Def1ance,12/08/2021,-7,Then play top and roam?  &#x200B  ????
rbmseo,hnp5a93,hnp5a93,Teleport change in PBE,Mostdakka,12/08/2021,0,If you can get 3-4 kills then yeah but like i said. breakpoint is 2 kills. That is 2 kills for yourself.  in the end its a gamble. It can pay off but if you want consistency then tping to your own lane is almost always a safer choice.
rbmseo,hnpcgbz,hnpcgbz,Teleport change in PBE,DingoThBOY,12/08/2021,-1,But that’s a coin flip completely.  30 cs and a level is worth a ton not to mention turret platings so depending on lane matchups by doing it you are essentially coin flipping the game.  Sure if the roam works you can get your team even if you get 2 kills or ahead of you get 3+ on a roam but at the same time if the roam goes bad you are putting yourself and potentially your team atrociously behind.  Why risk all of that when you could tp to lane which decreases the risk of you immediately throwing the game greatly
rbmseo,hnpbte4,hnpbte4,Teleport change in PBE,Angry---train,12/08/2021,-7,Bruisers arent even all that good  Best performing toplaners are tanks like TK and Shen and this is a specific buff to their stonewall farming simulator playstyle along with Shen being the only toplaner that can possibly influence the map now
rbmseo,hnpc0g6,hnpc0g6,Teleport change in PBE,Romu-,12/08/2021,-6,All those weak side top laners played in worlds and soloq. Graves Jayce Camille Irelia etc. Mean while bot lane is playing jhin and Ziggs. Supports leaving lane after lvl 4. I think you are watching some other game than league.

Not happening unless you are at 10% health with no summoner spells while the enemy botlane is full health with everything being up

rbmseo,hnq4r4i,hnq4r4i,Teleport change in PBE,ShewTheMighty,12/08/2021,1,Zils not boring. I feel like hes fun and one of the more interesting champions all about how you play him. If all you do is bomb farm and ult yourself he is dull af. But.... he can speed himself up for good roams ult to turn fights get huge teamfight stuns zone speed up teammates for kills slow down or stun enemy to counter engaged.  Hell just double bombing dragon/herald/baron pits can give you huge objective wins. if you speed up your jungler and time it well enough for jungler to possibly steal.  All this while dealing pretty legit damage on low cooldowns. Hes not an assassin that one shots people but hes damn good sustainable damage late game with crazy utility.  Zils kit is cracked if you know how to play him.
rbmseo,hnq5tub,hnq5tub,Teleport change in PBE,Thaedael,12/08/2021,1, I feel like Zilean (at least in support role) is easily punishable these days. Anivia is just a terrorist no matter what.

rbmseo,hnpe0rs,hnpe0rs,Teleport change in PBE,HardCoper,12/08/2021,27,Agreed and people cite his decent win rate as if his pick rate isnt average at best  If you are in any decent elo then you see Zac and you abuse him early while getting good vision to avoid cheese ganks  People out here acting like Zac is dominating the meta and unplayable for low mobility champs
rbmseo,hnpfc5s,hnpfc5s,Teleport change in PBE,ElBigDicko,12/08/2021,22,No he is good at high elo too probably one of few tank jungler which are pickable and good. The same way Nunu is elo inflator the Zac is in similar way since you dont really need to know how to gank well.  The mvspeed doesnt do anything vs him. People really overblown how many dashes are in game. Most ADCs dont have dash Galrforce is 90 sec cd. Supports too. Mages dont have dashes and very few have counterplay vs Zac (Syndra). Zac has so much damage with few items if he hits E you can get chunked hard.

rbmseo,hnpoe57,hnpoe57,Teleport change in PBE,Ninjahound789,12/08/2021,69,It reduces strategic complexity in favour of highlighting laning skill and trading power so I wouldnt say that it lowers skill expression merely shifts it.  Previously a stronger bot lane could not play aggressively if the enemy top laner was beating their top laner so even if they could mechanically win the 2v2 (or even if its due to simple counter pick) they couldnt push an advantage due to the threat of TP now that is no longer an issue so good individual laning becomes more valuable in bot.
rbmseo,hnpr3bj,hnpr3bj,Teleport change in PBE,RiftHunter4,12/08/2021,37,WTF? Is this satire?  >tell your toplaner to watch out for the TP  >you should be able to win the 3v3  > If your toplaner had to blow TP early or took ignite youll have to respect that  A lot of words to say Git Gud. None of that crap happens in Solo Q.   >This change just reduces strategic complexity favouring lower skill expression.  The change doesnt seem that bad to me. It should keep bot lane from getting punished for simply winning their lane early. Sups dont usually have the ward coverage to counter a top TP before 15min.
rbmseo,hnpf0gn,hnpf0gn,Teleport change in PBE,rumpelbrick,12/08/2021,19,This change removes level 3 tower dives with invulnerable minions. I see this as an absolute win.
rbmseo,hnq93dy,hnq93dy,Teleport change in PBE,ApplicationHorror483,12/08/2021,1,Yeah because tping into 2 people who you can easily 1v2 with your level advantage due to the state of ADCs early game now while having your own bot lane to back you up is just the epitome of skill expression.      Until the lanes xp nerfs are reverted changes like this are 100% necessary to make the lane playable. Having Mid/Jungle/Top non stop in the lane beating up people who are just straight up getting way worse XP rates from their play compared to you on top of you being a solo lane/position isnt skill expression. Its fundamentally broken and bad design. If you dont like the TP change you should be on your knees begging Riot to revert their dumb poorly thought out xp nerf that was meant to impact Jungle but ultimately just fucked bot lane.
rbmseo,hnpoycu,hnpoycu,Teleport change in PBE,BradL_13,12/08/2021,1,Or have your support sweep bushes or use pinks if the enemy top laner has tp.
rbmseo,hnq5gdn,hnq5gdn,Teleport change in PBE,MrDoulou,12/08/2021,1,No way dood the answer to the enemy top tping to abuse botlane should not be “ur top shoulda had and used tp so u can countergank sorry that’s just part of the game.” You could say something similar about almost any broken mechanic in the game. The fact is bot shouldnt purely be a stomping ground for the others to feed off of. We bot laners have dreams too!

rbmseo,hnpopzp,hnpopzp,Teleport change in PBE,McDrewbs,12/08/2021,2,Botlane is only the most important lane because other lanes get fed off of it as theres more gold available botlaners being ahead isnt a win condition its other roles getting ahead that is. And botlaners quickly get 1-2 levels behind and that gap just widens.  Other lanes shouldnt have to suffer to make top feel better. Bot already got hit with the duo-xp nerfs to make top laners feel better about existing. Give me my damn xp back so that by the time midgame rolls around I can be within 1k range of a solo laner and not die half a second later.

rbmseo,hnq1a7r,hnq1a7r,Teleport change in PBE,Exzodium,12/08/2021,1,Problably not a shared opinion but I honestly felt its kind of bs because it puts more pressure on top to perform and on bot not to feed.  Its one of those things that visually is great but how it feels is kind of ass.   Im not against the devs creating moments where team fights happen but I would prefer that those moments be fought over hard resources like camps.  Thats just a personal preference mind you.   I understand that there needs to be lane pressure. But I feel like so much of it is present in champion matchups that the lanes dont need the help.  If I was gonna create a similar feel I would probably want to buff jungle gank power that way the threat is there and the counter play of ward placement from bot & jungle us preserved.
rbmseo,hnq5j4a,hnq5j4a,Teleport change in PBE,wolfho,12/08/2021,1,You still can its called roaming we used to do it back in ye olden days and gank through lane. I think this could open up fun and more strategical play.

rbmseo,hnpxtou,hnpxtou,Teleport change in PBE,Sea-Selection-399,12/08/2021,3,Yeah you are right we should try and sweep the whole bottom side river and jungle and all the bushes all in the timeframe it takes for sweeper to reset while also trying to push the wave and not leave the ADC alone for 10 seconds.  Like cmon dude youre not going to catch every ward someone drops. Just watch 1 professional game and you will see how many wards get missed. Your idea is far to simple.
rbmseo,hnpsbgx,hnpsbgx,Teleport change in PBE,Merkantum,12/08/2021,1,I do that as well but there are also times where the lane is neutral and you want to take an engage. Then the enemy toplaner can still tp on a random caster minion
rbmseo,hnpyubh,hnpyubh,Teleport change in PBE,Sea-Selection-399,12/08/2021,2,yeah a 5-0 irelia/jax running around 3 levels up on everyone definitely has no influence on the game. /S
rbmseo,hnq39zr,hnq39zr,Teleport change in PBE,Merkantum,12/08/2021,1,The same can be true for a hard toplane diff. There is not much adc and support can do vs a super fed top. But the difference is ADC can almost always be oneshot while most toplaners also get close to be unkillable.  You can still roam bot and then use tp to go back top. Its easier for bot to react to that for sure but in the end you still can influence the lane. Given that you have decent Makro its more or less the same. Of course you cannot react in a split second but then again we are only talking about the first 14 min
rbmseo,hnphcv7,hnphcv7,Teleport change in PBE,pereza0,12/08/2021,5,I guess on champs without some tool to enable ganks you will need to grow your leads by split pushing and hope people come to you basically.    I still kinda like the change though makes champion kits more relevant

rbmseo,hnprqev,hnprqev,Teleport change in PBE,pereza0,12/08/2021,4,Taking any summoner other than TP requires better wave management. IE a good Ignite user will be very wary of trying to get a lvl 1 kill while a TP user can just yolo    TP lets bad laners fix mess ups    I did a bad push and let enemy freeze me as I backed. Lose a bunch of XP and Gold if you dont have TP   I let my enemy kill me as he slow pushed a big wave into me. Lose a bunch of XP and Gold if you dont have TP    TP still can have its uses to group for a drake for instance. But I am personally glad its no longer a gank tool pre 14 or a way to freeze easily. It already does enough
rbmseo,hnpqksc,hnpqksc,Teleport change in PBE,JustADelusion,12/08/2021,0,> A good top laner isnt someone who kills his laner in a pure 1v1 but he who plays the lane in that way that gets an advantage either way.  In league any laner who manages to kill his opponent **should** be rewarded for it and riot seems to agree considering this change. The top lane TP meta was backwards for a long enough.
rbmseo,hnpwett,hnpwett,Teleport change in PBE,WorstTactics,12/08/2021,2,Idk look at the damage it deals and its cd. Look how more often its picked than in past seasons.  Your argument was: I pick Trundle with Ignite I win 1v1 but now my opponent who has TP gets to freeze lane while I dont have TP.  Yeah so I am not saying its fair for the opponent you just beat to be able to deny your push like that but if you go ignite to be able to get that early kill then you cant complain about TP being overpowered. Dont pick ignite then. You cant have it all.

rbmseo,hnqehru,hnqehru,Teleport change in PBE,Jandromon,12/08/2021,1,Its not as good but insta TPing the supports engage only encourages him to play Yuumi instead. 2v2 bot is stale in high elo because of the huge threat of the common double TP.   Also this change destroys the TP-freeze toplane strat which is great for 1v1 earlygame aggressiveness in top.  Toplaners should trust Riot they can get compensation in other areas if needed after this change.
rbmseo,hnqgr1l,hnqgr1l,Teleport change in PBE,Jandromon,12/08/2021,1,I dont see why toplaners need to be able to roam easier than botlaners do. Yeah dragon being stronger now than herald makes the game more botlane centered but just before preseason and during Worlds Herald was much stronger and therefore every team played around top.  Supposing both Herald and Dragon are equal in strength what makes Top have less agency than ADC? without TP both have it hard to leave their lane and cant impact the map like jungle supp and mid can.
rbmseo,hnqank5,hnqank5,Teleport change in PBE,DizzyRonin,12/08/2021,1,I just want my own Dark Souls Aatrox Montage its not fair >:(
rbmseo,hnq6vpu,hnq6vpu,Teleport change in PBE,Waxburg,12/08/2021,1,Bronzie lol     ok but in seriousness top laners arent complaining about their impact once they get TO a fight theyre complaining about lack of opportunities to actually participate in the first place until the game hits the stage where everyone has already left their lane. Pre-14min theres already been 2 dragon fights bot lane and chances are theres been plenty of roams between mid and bot by both parties meanwhile top has had 1 Rift herald spawn and its a gambit whether people roam to fight over it in the first place. Bot and Mid have frequent lane interactions as dragon spawns between the both and bot can be ganked by mid easily for a massive gold/xp lead and supps can roam mid/river to interact with both teams junglers/midlaners to ensure more total map control. The issue here is that its often the case that by 14min the game has already snowballed out of control due to so much happening between bot/mid/jg and the top laner hasnt really had much say in the matter if they havent gone TP. Thing is now even people with TP cant actually impact the earlygame anymore so they have 0 say over what cards theyre dealt meanwhile mid/jg/bot have generally always have had some deal of it.   I could of course also go into how roaming is heavily punished in top lane due to how easy it is to push and actually 100-0 towers for top champs but I think Ill leave it at that.

Your enchanter support is going to deal more dmg than an extra like 40-80 armor is doing to hurt you even if all they do is aas and dont buff you so no.   This was just to prevent what would happen in proplay where people would all tp to one lane tower dive the lane and then take the tower in 3 seconds and get first tower gold then forcing the enemy bit to have a huge lane to get ganked from so theyre basically immeditley forced out of the game.

You spam spells to get the pittance the enemy duo allows you early game and then you just have CC in your kit so you can hopefully be useful later as the completely safe hyper-scaling ADC does their hyper-scaling ADC things.
rbmseo,hnpnjk9,hnpnjk9,Teleport change in PBE,midebita,12/08/2021,13,im playing in a group of new players and i had to explain that bot turret has less armour than the other turrets in the early game. they asked why and all i had to say was uhh well back a couple of years ago there was this laneswap meta...
rbmseo,hnpy03q,hnpy03q,Teleport change in PBE,Mahelas,12/08/2021,1,Its an excessively brutish and inelegant solution tho
rbmseo,hnq2evu,hnq2evu,Teleport change in PBE,raiyosss,12/08/2021,1,But this is a pro play argument my point is that in a coordinated setting the late game dragons matters far more since the team can coordinate better defences for a herald push. Being closer to soul is also more important when people are already playing 5 vs 5 fights to the extreme calibre present in pro play and need the soul to make the difference.
rbmseo,hnq39t2,hnq39t2,Teleport change in PBE,raiyosss,12/08/2021,1,I really doubt breaking one mid turret would swing the game so much. Neither team is quite strong enough to force anything with the tower gone snd loss of vision isnt even paticularly bad with the vision lines that are common in pro play.  There is the argument about first turret gold but i still dont believe that its enough to solo win them the second drake. The positioning of the botlane duo and especially the support should be a far greater advantage. The support dictates vision and this is already a vertical map it should be hell for the other team to push into.
rbmseo,hnq3n8q,hnq3n8q,Teleport change in PBE,autospacer13,12/08/2021,1,those also sound like bandaid solutions no?
rbmseo,hnpycxg,hnpycxg,Teleport change in PBE,NoBear2,12/08/2021,5,It’s a team game. If your teammate loses and their laner takes their lead to the other lanes they should be rewarded for that. Imagine you’re a top laner and you won your lane. But you gained no advantage and couldn’t impact the game. Sounds like fun doesn’t it?
rbmseo,hnpkhzj,hnpkhzj,Teleport change in PBE,RAStylesheet,12/08/2021,7,Its impossible to fix  Champions cna do only one thing and there isnt even that much gold on the rift.  The only solution is having all roles on a spectrum like in dota were if you dont get an early lead you can just lower your prio and be more supportive but this wont work in lol because here champions are extremely streamlined and items stats are everything
rbmseo,hnpduk2,hnpduk2,Teleport change in PBE,Assassin739,12/08/2021,21,A rune that has been in the game since alpha is a bandaid fix? I think teleport molested you as a child
rbmseo,hnpb9oj,hnpb9oj,Teleport change in PBE,signmeupreddit,12/08/2021,-1,explain to me how a teleport is similar to a stasis. You might as well say that is just like a health potion so its very balanced. Yes theyre both consumables
rbmseo,hnpj394,hnpj394,Teleport change in PBE,BradL_13,12/08/2021,1,Kinda weird stop watch is a singular item but GA revive isnt (not saying I support the idea)
rbmseo,hnpv49f,hnpv49f,Teleport change in PBE,Mornos,12/08/2021,1,Im going out on a limb here because Im not that proficient at league. These days champs work differently than just stomping lane or hard losing it. A good example is Kassadin His early game is weak. He has the staying power for lane (unless he gets hard countered by Pantheon). The difference to other champs is that Kassadin heavily lacks agency in the early game. With him on the team it gets hard to play for first and second drakes because he does not have the agency to build vision in the river or contribute to a fight. This lack of agency can snowball into a disadvantage even though he can (mostly) farm lane safely.   My gripe with the shift of power for Pantheon is that his kit is clearly designed for a midgame power spike. His abilities are essentially single target and his ult provides him with a lot of mobility. After his initial combo is finished he lacks damage. That makes him a great skirmisher with a lot of agency in lane and midgame. Because he lacks aoe damage he is not a good pick for team fights. When you played Pantheon you had to make your advantage in agency count before 20 minutes. Either by gainging a big enough advantage to close the game or by parading as a crutch for scaling champs on your team Now they change his numbers and make his numbers so strong for late that he becomes a good enough teamfighter and in turn his agency for early and mid is reduced. That is despite the fact that he is designed as a skirmisher.   At this point I think that flattening and equalising power curves makes the game less interesting. It takes away nuance in draft and in gameplay.

rbmseo,hnq8sbe,hnq8sbe,Teleport change in PBE,Odd_Play_5769,12/08/2021,1,Thats fair Ill be interested to see their reasoning for this change
rbmseo,hnq8d40,hnq8d40,Teleport change in PBE,Waxburg,12/08/2021,1,Remember the average consoomer wants speed and action and fast hitting dopamine constantly injected into their veins with as little effort required as possible on their part. I mean how would they otherwise retain the energy needed to wipe the cheeto dust off their fingers and watch bingewatch the latest netflix series later?
rbmseo,hnq91yo,hnq91yo,Teleport change in PBE,shrubs311,12/08/2021,1,and yet junglers and mids and tops almost never get 4 or 5 man attacked. but if i walk past the middle of the lane botlane thats a very real threat. theres only so much ward and sweeper coverage you can have early game to mitigate that  that being said im not sure how i feel about the changes. its quite a large change
rbmseo,hnpuxca,hnpuxca,Teleport change in PBE,SerJeffe,12/08/2021,7,Its much easier to have a winning bot support roam and pressure or just swap the lane after turret is down while top seems to be stuck top untill otherlanes unlock.
rbmseo,hnpmfgl,hnpmfgl,Teleport change in PBE,cancerBronzeV,12/08/2021,-9,All the top laners in this thread somehow forgetting the entire rift herald existing on their side of the map as a way to impact the map (or ya know they can also roam mid or help their jungler invade or do any number of things that take more than a single brain cell needed to press a button on bot lane).
rbmseo,hnq9tf4,hnq9tf4,Teleport change in PBE,Scrinwarrior,12/08/2021,1,“That’s League and it happens to every role”  No no it doesn’t. But I guess I could expect that sort of take from someone whose answer to the problem is “just win lane duh”.   A losing jungle can play the opposite side of the map from his opponent. Gank top when they gank bot play opposing objectives and try to force a bigger lead on his winning lanes.  A losing mid can roam bot or top. Or help his jungle invade.   A losing bot can have their adc farm under tower while their support roams mid or invades with jungle.  Meanwhile top? You can’t solo Rift without 100% certainty that the enemy jungle isn’t topside and that your laner is backed without tp. You’re already losing 1v1 so the 2v2 isn’t looking any better with your jungle. You can try to roam mid but you’ll lose every tower plate and multiple waves to do it putting you so astronomically behind that you have become useless and that’s assuming your gank succeeds. And all this is after the absolute INDUSTRIAL strength counterpick meta that exists in top lane (that you probably never noticed because no one plays Trundle top).
rbmseo,hnq5nhd,hnq5nhd,Teleport change in PBE,PhantomRager,12/08/2021,1,I see what your thoughts are but thats not exactly the truth. If botlane is ahead they can easily farm double kills and snowball really hard. Or adc can stay in lane and farm while the support roams and gets midlane ahead. And well drake spaws directly next to bot lane and dragon souls are always a reliable win condition. Top lane does have herald tho but they are mostly only useful as long as there are turret platings and its most often the jungler that goes for early heralds.  Regarding the teleport changes: yes it does suck when you lose your lane because the enemy top Laner teleports botlane. BUT over multiple games you should get even amount of numbers where a toplaner tps bot and wins the game and 50% of the time its yours. And in soloQ and my elo (only dia 4 which is low elo) it doesnt happen frequently that a toplaner tps bot lane AND that it wasnt useless.   Its not like every game the enemy toplaner teleports to botlane on cooldown.  Its a team game after all and by the nature of the current meta its very optimal to play around bot and secure dragons. Having the option as a toplaner to be present is nice even if you dont have to tp.
rbmseo,hnqa45n,hnqa45n,Teleport change in PBE,Scrinwarrior,12/08/2021,1,There are far more differences between the lanes than just that but thanks for the laugh I guess.

rbmseo,hnq8rml,hnq8rml,Teleport change in PBE,Waxburg,12/08/2021,1,>I dont know like win your lane take towers  Ok but keep in mind youre talking about one of the most counterpick heavy lanes currently in league where its a 50/50 chance by champ select whether youll be getting perma pushed under tower and camped to death or doing the same to your opponent instead.

rbmseo,hnpq7wv,hnpq7wv,Teleport change in PBE,Play_more_FFS,12/08/2021,1,Oh yes because there is totally match ups that allow 4 man dives two minutes into laning phase TWO MINUTES.   My jg was graves but notice how I didn’t say anything about my jg? Graves can’t predict that our mid laner is an idiot to allow Kat to dive bot with full HP while losing zero minions on top of that at 3:40 barely 2 minutes into the laning phase.   You either hit the Kat or manipulate the wave to where she lose XP/gold if she attempts to roam. Our mid didn’t do both. Matchup doesn’t matter for this unless you’re playing something stupid like Janna mid which wasn’t the case.  Mid might as well be AFK no excuses.

rbmseo,hnpvr4z,hnpvr4z,Teleport change in PBE,kickassguy,12/08/2021,1,most botlane TPs are risky early game and u dont just secure your team a lead when its successful but it also most likely gives you a lead so idk why u think people tp botlane to help botlane. they do it to secure themselves a lead just as much as it is to help their team
rbmseo,hnpc7jh,hnpc7jh,Teleport change in PBE,MawrCalleach,12/08/2021,6,Thank you.  I do follow sum school just thought it was related to topic so I would ask. I main Garen and learning back up options but ai usually get collapsed on and my team doesnt do the right thing if I splitpush. Now I dont want to complain just why I am thinking this way.
rbmseo,hnpy7nt,hnpy7nt,Teleport change in PBE,MawrCalleach,12/08/2021,1,Good point. The thing I enjoy most about league is wave management. Also not very good at tracking enemy jungler so first am looking to learn that and then moght play it.  Also already tried and found myself have sub 30% wr. Which is not an issue for me but was for my teammates and I felt really bad about that.
rbmseo,hnqalxe,hnqalxe,Teleport change in PBE,MawrCalleach,12/08/2021,1,Ty for your opinion! I always play for dragons and even urge my jungler at the start of the game to play for bot to get dragons as my games usually go to 30-40 mins and dragons are a huge win-con then.  Will have to work on getting that herald. Also laning is what I am learning at the moment just thinking about the match up and wave and trading.
rbmseo,hnq3dfa,hnq3dfa,Teleport change in PBE,WiatrowskiBe,12/08/2021,1,And even if your team doesnt fight with numbers advantage youre allowing them to catch up on resources and/or deny enemy some resources (pushing waves taking jungle camps) with much less risk. As ADC after losing botlane theres hardly a better thing I can reliably count on that enemy support being forced to leave lane to salvage collapsing topside allowing us to 1v2 and catch up to enemy ADC.
rbmseo,hnpqxxk,hnpqxxk,Teleport change in PBE,MawrCalleach,12/08/2021,1,Ty for your answer!

rbmseo,hnpk7ad,hnpk7ad,Teleport change in PBE,SuperBeastJ,12/08/2021,21,Early heralds are far more important than the first or second drakes. Its just that people still think drake is a massively important early game obj and int for it over and over.
rbmseo,hnphtro,hnphtro,Teleport change in PBE,Hydraplayshin,12/08/2021,0,Drake is not powerful.  Last two seasons every pro team played for TOP and 8-9 min HERALD fight. so stop saying botlane is op when its literally the weakest role in the game.
rbmseo,hnpk4k0,hnpk4k0,Teleport change in PBE,gasti99,12/08/2021,38,Hahahaha ok i guess mid and jungle ganking bot without risking fucking anything is fair but toplaners using a high cd sum risking plates and waves so they can gank the most importante lane is unfair and deserves this nerf

rbmseo,hnps6f2,hnps6f2,Teleport change in PBE,iMidg3t,12/08/2021,-1,Yea toplaner capitalizing on botlane not paying attention to enemy summs and the map is rly unfair how dare they!?!?!?  You are master player for sure xD
rbmseo,hnpcvfz,hnpcvfz,Teleport change in PBE,Angry---train,12/08/2021,15,Use proper vision and clear the wards  Teleporting bot is a gigantic gamble because the enemy toplaner is guaranteed to gain 600 gold while you are away
rbmseo,hnpcsq7,hnpcsq7,Teleport change in PBE,DC_Flint,12/08/2021,19,If we dont want other roles impacting our lanes I demand a wall toplane that keeps junglers out for the first 14 minutes of the game thank you. How on earth is a toplane player supposed to win a game if hes not allowed to impact other positions but supports and junglers roam all over the map laughing in your face while you get dove for the third time.   Skill differences on other positions should matter. You dont get special treatment cause you play botlane.
rbmseo,hnpd60b,hnpd60b,Teleport change in PBE,DC_Flint,12/08/2021,22,You play jungle the role with the most influence over any given lane if you want to and complain that top can influence other lanes like _once_ every 5 minutes when they present themselves on a platter?  > There are so many games where I have to pray that my solo laners are smart enough to create a lead for themselves  And as toplaner I have to pray every single game my bot doesnt die twice before I hit level 6 and I can only watch. Whats your point?
rbmseo,hnpe3g5,hnpe3g5,Teleport change in PBE,Th_Call_of_Ktulu,12/08/2021,7,Oh yeah but when your botlane is getting shitstomped and your toplaner can help them then you sudenly dont feel bad?
rbmseo,hnq2i0o,hnq2i0o,Teleport change in PBE,DC_Flint,12/08/2021,3,Believe it or not if my adc gets behind _I will lose the game too_. Dont get me wrong ADC as a role has a myriad of problems but top getting a chance to impact other lanes every 5 minutes is not one of them.  Also instead of resorting to base insults you could try to give me an argument as to why I should think like you.
rbmseo,hnp9zk2,hnp9zk2,Teleport change in PBE,barryh4rry,12/08/2021,8,not most important its the general consensus that they are the strongest and that’s mostly because they can impact the map more so the bot lane easily
rbmseo,hnpa6r4,hnpa6r4,Teleport change in PBE,Toxic_Fkin_Noob,12/08/2021,11,Jungle is the most important *role*. Bot lane is the most important *lane*. The winning bot lane gets all the dragons the team with all the dragons wins the game.
rbmseo,hnpbweb,hnpbweb,Teleport change in PBE,JustJohnItalia,12/08/2021,1,Jungle is strong because it can put other lanes ahead botlane is the most important lane.  They could cut in half the power of every bot carry and support and it would still be the most important lane because winning bot means getting dragons and putting 2 players ahead rather than one
rbmseo,hnqaem1,hnqaem1,Teleport change in PBE,Lord-Babbled,12/08/2021,1,If you think about League as a war game it actually makes perfect sense.  You are a battlefield commander/shock troop. Your minions are regular soldiers and your wards are scouts. If my scouts are telling me that the enemy is massing for an assault at another fortification (top lane tower dive) then I have the ability to respond with an assault on their opposite fortification (Dive or seige bot).   If that isnt an option available to me given my current resource allocation as the bot lane commander then potential supply raids (attacking their jungle camps for gold or vision) becomes one of my few options.  League is a game of information. Thats why they removed Trackers Knife so long ago- too much information too reliably. Understanding your position as a battlefield commander is what will allow you to take into account the enemys potential quick response force (High mobility Champs like Talons/LeBlanc Teleports Corki package counter ganks). Thats why games used to be so much MORE methodical.   If I as the top lane commander see that my soldiers are siegeing the top lane fortification sufficiently without my help- Im given more agency to act as a reinforcement to other lanes (i.e. my teleport if Im not playing Shen or something similar). If I make the mistake of misreading the battlefield- then an enemy commander with high wave clear can then punish my soldiers and my fortifications while Im away.  All of that bullshit essentially translates into this: if you arent looking at the flow of battle and dont understand the capacity of your enemy to punish your battlefield positioning- then you deserve to lose because you lacked the ability to properly allocate your forces against an enemy commander.
rbmseo,hnp7zbz,hnp7zbz,Teleport change in PBE,SnooAbbreviations503,12/08/2021,38,This actually a buff for tf galio because their mid can’t follow them with the tele unless you are Sylas.
rbmseo,hnpgvdq,hnpgvdq,Teleport change in PBE,cbrozz,12/08/2021,5,TP bot to impact with some tanks juggernauts is very doable too. I tp bot all the time with Malph because his ult is broken and Ornn less often but its still very possible because its 100% a kill if they lack an escape on a champion and are overextended.
rbmseo,hnpmox6,hnpmox6,Teleport change in PBE,Boockel,12/08/2021,3,In soloq tping bot at 14minutes is trolling in 90% of scenarios ignoring how it basically doesnt happen. Get your head out your arse top are not bot in most games from tps
rbmseo,hnpat9m,hnpat9m,Teleport change in PBE,Radiant_Shelter688,12/08/2021,22,The counterplay is monitoring enemy summs not pushing when TP is up or sweep bushes before pushing. If you push the wave mindlessly you should be punished for it thats just how the game works.
rbmseo,hnpb6iz,hnpb6iz,Teleport change in PBE,PureImbalance,12/08/2021,28,oh no I have to actually think of this possibility of TP and sweep/not overextend :/    This change just reduces skill expression
rbmseo,hnphvyr,hnphvyr,Teleport change in PBE,SneakyBadAss,12/08/2021,0,Yeah Im tired juggling all the wards on the bottom to have all bushes covered for some dimwit from top to TP.  I can realistically cover the three on lane and 1 in river but I cant also keep an eye on enemy bush near drake. Some even just ward random place usually behind the line even behind my own turrets.  When you finally get the upper hand against oppressive midlane-rejects dare to push in the middle suddenly a  Mordekaiser from behind your tower is frolicking its way to get a double kill while jungler is closing in from river.   I very much welcome this change for early game.
rbmseo,hnpcae9,hnpcae9,Teleport change in PBE,Angry---train,12/08/2021,14,Ofcourse risking your entire lane and the prospect of getting killed bot is actually the 0 skill 0 risk ultra rewarding option  But automatically teleporting to your turret is actually the skillful optionthat makes sence doesnt it.
rbmseo,hnpckst,hnpckst,Teleport change in PBE,Nibz11,12/08/2021,9,teleport being nerfed means you are stuck in your lane with no opportunity to look to other lanes so it makes being counterpicked all the more miserable.

rbmseo,hnqic02,hnqic02,Teleport change in PBE,Arkaidan8,12/08/2021,1,I dont think you understood what happened so let me more clear.  First off i am not complaining about the jungler killing me i am complaining about the xp lead he had over me while being 3-0.  Ok so: I was Sett top lane playing against Rengar top lane + Khazix jungle.  I sat in the top bush before the minions spawned to cheese him because i knew he would walk there: i killed him. Minions had yet to spawn so we both walked back to lane normally. Before we even took down the first wave i killed him again. He then tped back to lane and i dove him killing him a 3rd time. After i dove him Khazix came to finish me off after the dive (i was half health under theitlr towers with no cooldowns) and i had yet to get lvl 3 and after he killed me and took half a wave worth of xp and he was lvl 4 while i had barely just hit lvl 3 when i was fighting him.  You tell me if that shit is fair
rbmseo,hnpzcmw,hnpzcmw,Teleport change in PBE,Radiant_Shelter688,12/08/2021,0,Then we both agree that winning botlane has an enormous impact compared to toplane.

While what youre advocating for is to remove any agency a toplaner can have in skirmishes in the most important lane of the game.  Walking down to botlane is the dumbest thing to do. One ward spotting you and you literally burned your TP for nothing.
rbmseo,hnqc02d,hnqc02d,Teleport change in PBE,Radiant_Shelter688,12/08/2021,1,>So why not have it where both tops can just save tp for lane.  Because a big part of the toplane roster doesnt care about laning power and needs to have an impact during the early-mid game. Why would you pick Renekton or any tank who will fall off near late when you can take Camille Tryndamere or Jax who now have no reason to move their ass and can just free farm the whole game until they become scaling monsters for free because they can even take ignite and stomp lane with 0 problems ?  Seriously Bot mains have no idea how much this change will drastically impact THEM. You hate dealing with late game bruisers like Jax or Fiora ? Well cant wait for them to be picked every single game because why would you care about picking an early toplaner ? And now that botlane is even more punishable (Because toplaner and midlaner cannot TP to countergank you anymore) junglers will spend all time botside so scaling toplaners will care much less about being ganked in early.
rbmseo,hnplw1j,hnplw1j,Teleport change in PBE,Radiant_Shelter688,12/08/2021,8,The support and jungler can literally bully the enemy jungler for free when bot is winning are we even playing the same game ?
rbmseo,hnpiyhm,hnpiyhm,Teleport change in PBE,Angry---train,12/08/2021,1,Its not realistic since botlane has two times more wards than the all the other lanes with the support constantly fighting for vision control. Only way that the toplaner can get a good TP gank on you is if you completely missed a wardoverextended and didnt see him teleporting with all off these 3 things being easily avoidable.  >Anyway its pointless to argue about outplay potential. Riot saw the problem and fixed it.  Toplaners were able to influence the game while automatically loosing 600 gold in terms of minions and platesbut hey the enemy botlane might get killed after being overextended with no vision while not seeing the teleport animation so its better to just nuke the unwashed peasants and their unclean island and give them a permanent nuclear winter
rbmseo,hnpq506,hnpq506,Teleport change in PBE,Angry---train,12/08/2021,1,Who would have thought that being able to constantly communicate with all 4 of your team members and set up plays with them would prove to be more efficient in comparison to soloQ  Either way there are virtually 0 tp flanks in pro play with most of them happening after the enemy support was able to catch someone/set up a play
rbmseo,hnq594p,hnq594p,Teleport change in PBE,Radiant_Shelter688,12/08/2021,1,The same way you dont try shit when the enemy midlaner shoved his lane you dont try anything either when the toplaner shoved his.
rbmseo,hnq69jm,hnq69jm,Teleport change in PBE,ethan0614,12/08/2021,1,If they’re dedicating one of their two summoner spells to ganking you with TP and never actually use TP and just hold it all game looking for that gank then congrats you played safe/smart enough to waste that summoner slot and give your team an advantage.
rbmseo,hnqdhre,hnqdhre,Teleport change in PBE,Waxburg,12/08/2021,1,Playing Shen with TP is a very different experience than what most normal top laners have. Most laners cant get to roams anywhere near as quickly as a Shen would be able to post-6 as he has possibly the most overall map agency of any champion in the game outside of TF.  For most of us we cant just drop everything and roam instanty then TP back for no repercussion even against a hard pusher like Yorick. The issue for most tops is that the roam itself takes too long for it to be worth it a lot of the time since chances are weve just had most of our tower plates taken because we chose to take a gamble to possibly get another lane ahead. The TP change just hard locks most tops other than Shen into their own lane meaning theres very little way for players in bad matchups to try and help their teams anymore.  Shen is probably going to solidify his place as the top laner with the most global  impact even more from now on if these changes go through as no other top can even match his roams anymore.
rbmseo,hnpb9j7,hnpb9j7,Teleport change in PBE,LordDarthAnger,12/08/2021,16,Never forget pro scene when Threah hits a hook at bot and four teleports instantly appear
rbmseo,hnpbc6p,hnpbc6p,Teleport change in PBE,JustJohnItalia,12/08/2021,16,Problem is that when you are so isolated  1) you cant influence the game until way too late dragon souls only made it worse  2) because you cant roam effectively if you are behind you are effectively a dead player which means that a single gank can kill your laning phase. You dont even need to be ganked tbh just the jungler hovering top forces you to give up cs and maybe even xp which puts you plenty behind
rbmseo,hnpbbwc,hnpbbwc,Teleport change in PBE,Angry---train,12/08/2021,6,And that is exactly why toplane was one of the worst lanes in the entire game  Being unable to influence the map at all removes any reason to do anything bur AFK farm and play a scaling champion/tank for 20 minutes
rbmseo,hnpg2gd,hnpg2gd,Teleport change in PBE,Empty_ManaPotion,12/08/2021,5,>It means that riot wants to cater to core playstyle of the role which is more of 1v1 isolated brawling.   then remove jungler from able to go top.

rbmseo,hnp81zl,hnp81zl,Teleport change in PBE,Nordic_Marksman,12/08/2021,5,No getting kills for your team almost always better than a CS lead simply because of how Xp works. Even 1 kill for a champ that likes early kills is worth TP since they probably also blow sums.
rbmseo,hnpc7jc,hnpc7jc,Teleport change in PBE,JustJohnItalia,12/08/2021,3,What does that have to do with anything.  You could pick those champions and play weakside depending on the matchup. Do you know what weakside means? It doesnt mean to play a weak champion or be useless

rbmseo,hnpa5hk,hnpa5hk,Teleport change in PBE,Jozoz,12/08/2021,5,Which is exactly why I think its good. Its a meaningful change and will drastically change pro play for the better (imo).  This way we have a laning phase where individual skill and playmaking isnt arbitrarily constrained by the fear of TPs.  Without the fear of TP youd see a lot more solo kills and risky trades in pro play during the laning phase.
rbmseo,hnpbtxj,hnpbtxj,Teleport change in PBE,Jozoz,12/08/2021,12,Thats very different.  Balance changes dont qualify as a **very** different version of the game.  Its just an older patch that all us regular players already know from first hand experience. If we follow your idea then pros play on a patch none of us would ever try.  You are arguing that we should fundamentally alter the game pros play. This is not comparable.

rbmseo,hnpbzjs,hnpbzjs,Teleport change in PBE,Toxic_reborn,12/08/2021,3,But your botlane is getting shit stomped while you are kinda ahead in the toplane while both junglers are applying equal kind of pressure. You would want to make some impact. plus just because they remove TPs early game and one botlane is getting demolished it will lead to that losing bot lane to farm for 20 mins understand which is alot less fun to watch compared to early teamfights that are fun to watch
rbmseo,hnp8u09,hnp8u09,Teleport change in PBE,Gaia_Knight2600,12/08/2021,0,if tp is taken by pretty much all top laners and most mid laners wont i increase choice if tp gets nerfed? now there is a bigger incentive to pick ignite
rbmseo,hnqj0px,hnqj0px,Teleport change in PBE,KingFredo5674,12/08/2021,1,Lets assume for starters that one of these 4 men are the jungler. Thats just his job and ganking you is part of it.  Now lets assume the 4th man is mid laner. If mid laner walked down to bot lane without using tp and you get 4 man dove thats on you for not having proper map awareness. You walk back to T2 tower if you need to but if you didnt look at your map to see that then thats on you. If the mid laner however tpd to your lane then you need to realize that hes going to be down in both gold and tower plates because your mid laner is going to get the gold and plates. If your mid laner also took teleport but didnt react to it then he either didnt see a winning scenario (which is something that can again be avoided with proper map awareness on both your ends as well) or it was on cooldown.  Now take these points and multiply them by 2 for top lane. Thats right. Even if Im playing top lane and I tp to dive you I will potentially lose out on 2-3 minion waves AND 2 tower plates which basically means my enemy has around a 600 gold lead on me all because I decided to help my bot lane get ahead.  Nobody seems to realize that all actions have consequences and that even if you get 4 man dove you need to realize that there are other places where the enemy team is losing out on because theyre pouring a lot of resources onto the 4 man gank. The only reason it works is because the person that gets ganked once can be ganked over and over again bc of lack of map awareness. Go watch some rekkles streams to see how perfect this man plays just to not give the enemy team any form of advantage.

Even if Darius runs ignite which is trolling you dont get the same effect against most other Top Laners (during laning phase) since they are not dependent on in-fight sustain like Darius.

rbmseo,hnphue9,hnphue9,Teleport change in PBE,PsychoPass1,12/08/2021,53,The problem is for higher level players even just the threat of the TP makes them play the lane completely differently.

rbmseo,hnqbchn,hnqbchn,Teleport change in PBE,ApplicationHorror483,12/08/2021,1,Also incredibly weird cope to suggest most tps happen when there are 3-4 waves of cs built up for the top laners turret. Hell I think most top laners would just say sorry I couldnt tp and wait to just gank with tp after they clean out their lane and their bot lane respawns if they actually even died in the first place.
rbmseo,hnpsevw,hnpsevw,Teleport change in PBE,PureImbalance,12/08/2021,-5,But thats not how any of this works    Clicking on Toplane for .5 seconds can inform you whether you can go in without the threat of them TPing. Its not like this window of opportunity is always open to toplaners. Play some Shen and see yourself holding your ult because its not a good moment lane-state wise. And again you can sweep behind you or keep an eye out for those minions. Yes you might not be able to fully commit from minute 1 but If you bait out a TP and successfully disengage that can give your team a huge advantage (plus now you have 6 minutes of free pressure while your Toplaner still has TP up). The problem remains that Botlaners are still completely unwilling to teamplay and use their head for Macro.     If the enemy toplaner TPs and gets nothing thats a free herald topside. Thats also 2 waves and a plate for your toplaner who now has TP advantage which puts pressure on your enemy botlane.   Youre acting as if nobody botlane ever engages because theyre so scared of TPs behind them. The reality is that once a botlane is 2 kills up it becomes extremely risky for a Toplaner to TP behind them and risk just feeding another kill in addition to losing so much top/giving gold via plates.
rbmseo,hnptttf,hnptttf,Teleport change in PBE,IforgotmyAOLpassword,12/08/2021,-6,It also makes toplane basically worthless in the early game.

rbmseo,hnpw7s9,hnpw7s9,Teleport change in PBE,Both_Requirement_766,12/08/2021,0,ok. but I bet that way more players will just use tp early to get to their tower back quickly. the other thing is within dota2 you only tp to the tower when helping another lane so there is that.  at least it would help toplane if theyd shorten the cooldown of tp. that would be a good thing when considering that you lose the ability to make awesome ward/minion-tps in the first 14mins tho.
rbmseo,hnpt5fq,hnpt5fq,Teleport change in PBE,naheulbeukzantar,12/08/2021,3,Well a lot of supports do roam between bot and mid. Plus bot lane has the most impact on dragon whilst herald isnt as impactful most of the time and takes much longer to spawn.  Also as the adc you dont really want to miss waves since youre already sharing exp with the support so if you start missing waves to help top lane you will be behind real quick.

rbmseo,hnpd5wd,hnpd5wd,Teleport change in PBE,Merkantum,12/08/2021,1,The problem i have with Early Botlane TPs is that i mainly play aggressive supporters. Thing is you are already on a timer before lulu yuumi & Co out scale you anyway. Games are going on longer and picking scaling bot lanes is getting more rewarding. But I personally think leaving TP and jungle pressure as it is right know make it way too easy to go unpunished through early game. Being able to still counter early dives is pretty fair imo  Its similar in toplane: if you have a bad matchup u have to respect that and drop behind early if you want to be able to outscale and eventually win. Its just that you wont ever be punished by enemy tp if you try to play your matchup right
rbmseo,hnpz630,hnpz630,Teleport change in PBE,EldtinbGamer,12/08/2021,0,Just like its annoying to get jungle ganked or mid or support roamed. Doesnt mean it shouldnt exist.   My flair is Camille and Akali with a funny quote. Why does that suddenly make me impossible to reason with?

I know you botlaners like to think that ur the main character but thats just not the truth there are 3 other people also playing the game that want to have some sort of power or strength.

Bot lane can roam around and 2v1 push whichever lane and take towers mid lane can roam to any lane between waves jungle can gank and top can TP every 6 minutes. It almost feels like the least top can have and now thats even being taken away.

rbmseo,hnpxsit,hnpxsit,Teleport change in PBE,pereza0,12/08/2021,2,> Idk look at the damage it deals and its cd. Look how more often its picked than in past seasons.   TP is still overwhelmingly more popular specially if you look at higher ELO and proplay. Ignite is more of a midlane thing as the lane is shorter and champs are bustier.    Top laners now are willing to sacrifice Flash before Teleport now (look at how popular TP/Ignite got) for lane pressure    > Yeah so I am not saying its fair for the opponent you just beat to be able to deny your push like that but if you go ignite to be able to get that early kill then you cant complain about TP being overpowered. Dont pick ignite then. You cant have it all.    Maybe you didnt need ignite to get the kill (this is doubly true on trundle at lvl1 another reason I dont take it anymore) . But you will still be punished   The thing is. TP obviously scales better than Ignite. TP is very versatile (right now it can be used to fix missplays or enemy ganks in your lane. You can gank lanes with it. You can use it aggressively in lane - heavy trade then TP back with full resources + items. You can use it to get to objectives without sacrificing farm or even forcing a 5v4. You can prevent a dive entirely by blocking a minion wave) and on top of all that you can even prevent your opponent from crashing a wave.   Ignite does one thing only   Sure if gives kill pressure. But TP can easily let you create a situation that gives you more kill pressure than Ignite does depending on the champ you are playing

However solo plating gold matters not exactly soloqueue advice asking random supports to cuck their own game plan to advance yours - but in a cooperative environment with comms taking the plate alone makes a lot of sense.  As far as walking back and forth doesnt really do anything since stacks last for 20 entire seconds and are not dynamic (if the plate was credited to 3 champions the tower gets 120 resistances for 20 seconds and it doesnt matter how many champions are around during those 20 seconds).

rbmseo,hnpuxdp,hnpuxdp,Teleport change in PBE,happygreenturtle,12/08/2021,2,You cant really afford to even attempt a solo herald as a top laner except in very specific circumstances. I agree with the general tone of your post in that top laners do have ways to impact the map but the rift herald take just isnt it.   You need your Jungler to play top side or you need to have killed the enemy top with them having no TP pushed your wave to enemy turret enemy mid not have prio to roam top and the enemy Jungle also not being top. And soloing Herald is not quick for the majority of top laners. Almost never worth the risk
rbmseo,hnqgahu,hnqgahu,Teleport change in PBE,happygreenturtle,12/08/2021,1,I think youve lost sight of the original argument and youre putting words in my mouth. I definitely agree that top lane is highly susceptible to counterpicks. Thats why I settled on Trundle/Mundo as my champ pool because I was so frustrated of having to intricately learn every matchup of carries that it wasnt worth the effort and Trundle/Mundo have very few bad matchups.   But that doesnt mean **top lane has no impact** which is what was implied in the comment I replied to. By saying how can top lane impact the map without pre-14 min TPs that is what was effectively being said. And I dont agree with that   Top lane can impact the map by winning lane or otherwise playing to your champion identity. Like if you survive to 20 minutes as Kayle with maybe only one death and 8cs/min and didnt give away all of your tower platings then you won lane  Youre focusing in on what a losing lane can do. Whereas I was talking about what different roles can achieve broadly. Theres a subtle difference
rbmseo,hnqeah6,hnqeah6,Teleport change in PBE,ThePreposterousPear,12/08/2021,1,Thats exactly the truth. Im sorry but your options are now exactly the same as bot lane. If you want to impact the map you have to take your objective. Win your lane get rift herald take top tower then use your extra free time to impact the map.   I dont think you understand just how frustrating it is to get TPed on as bot lane. If enemy mid and top both have TP theres always a timer for one of them to have TP advantage. You as bot lane then have to wait for enemy top and mid to have teleport on cool down have enemy jungle on top side and for enemy bot to make a mistake before you can trade or fight.    Also you can still be present for dragon as a top laner except you are now required to use your brain and plan ahead. You have to run bot before drag spawns and then teleport to top after. Its not like you dont have options.

If they were able to reliably capitalize on a lead and transform it to a victory they would not be in bronze for extended periods of time. They would be at least in gold.  It is much easier and more reliable to just improve oneself to learn how to reliably do better than your opponent and how to capitalize on your small leads before even considering teamwide macro-movements.
rbmseo,hnqbqu0,hnqbqu0,Teleport change in PBE,MawrCalleach,12/08/2021,1,I see your point. People would support your opinion in higher divisions than bronze as you can rely on them more easily.

rbmseo,hnq3e7z,hnq3e7z,Teleport change in PBE,PhoenixAgent003,12/08/2021,1,Pro tip if you’re going to split push try to establish a “line of vision” so you can see any collapses coming.   It’s kind of hard to explain without visual aids but if you set up wards in a line—like say one in top pixel one near Blue buff and krugs you’re extremely likely to see any collapses coming once they cross the “line” that you’ve drawn between your wards.  Does that make any sense?
rbmseo,hnpcybs,hnpcybs,Teleport change in PBE,AliceInHololand,12/08/2021,3,Doesn’t matter if you get collapsed on and die.

rbmseo,hnq7mar,hnq7mar,Teleport change in PBE,MichaelBJordan,12/08/2021,1,When you purposefully frame it as negative as possible for the Top laner sure you’re right.   But realistically the Top Laner is looking to shove their lane in back off and look for the TP angle. If the enemy bot lane is winning typically they are shoved in. If your botlane placed a good ward you can literally TP at an angle better than any gank would provide your level advantage is higher than your jungler and the enemy botlane can really only walk back to their tower and hope they can escape or take a kill with them.   So yeah as the winning bot lane it is really frustrating to lose your lead advantage because you got the advantage in the first place. And honestly most bot lanes at Gold and above know how to freeze lanes and hold winning lanes at an uncomfortable position. And if you’re a Top laner who does NOT do the above when TPing bot then of course I’m not as mad because then I know you don’t understand wave management or lane states therefore I know you probably  won’t have proper macro mid to late game as a Top laner. Therefore we’ll win eventually through obj and towers which = easy gold.

rbmseo,hnpe3cu,hnpe3cu,Teleport change in PBE,Mundo_SMOrc,12/08/2021,16,Literally this. A lot of the issues were already solved when Riot heavily nerfed the channel duration nerfed the cooldown and made it so you couldnt cancel it.  Theres so much risk that already goes into making a TP play bottom lane youre letting your opponent acquire additional farm and potentially a ton of turret plating which can easily put them back into the game if behind or heavily increase their lead.  And guess what? Your opponent can match your TP if the opportunity is there which puts it on even grounds.  Early to mid TPs on bot is the period of time we use to mitigate any snowballs the enemy bot may be acquiring. The lane is so volatile and generally paves the way the mid game plays out due to it being closer to dragon.  An Irelia teleporting on you 2 levels ahead isnt really new either such a thing has existed since TP was a thing. The players that complain about this are generally the ones who hard push without clearing wards in lane bushes or River.  But I guess some players just need a full 14 minutes to ensure they get a big enough lead without any interference from other lanes whilst playing a team oriented game ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
rbmseo,hnpdzm2,hnpdzm2,Teleport change in PBE,Iperovic,12/08/2021,-6,1) Im not always going to be around bot  2) Often times I cant come bot because of the said TP difference in the first place  The number of times Ive lost jng not to the enemy jng but because every one of my plays was shut down by a TP is quite high  Also its not once every 5 mins if you have tp on both mid and top more realistically its 2.5 mins for one of them to probably have it up  If you consider dragon respawn time is one of the biggest focuses early to mid if your enemy is willing to tp to it and your teammate isnt/cant means the first 2 drakes are lost and you have to pray you can accumulate a gold lead high enough to fight for the next one  Sometimes you have to spend minutes creating a play on one side of the map only for it to be nullified and even turned around by a tp it sucks balls and Im glad were getting back into a normal 1 vs 1 and 2 vs 2 lane state

Which is why they are nerfing TP. So you cant cheese TP and get your botlane ahead just cuz you are 2 levels higher than the enemy bot and this also applies to TPs from mid champs as well.
rbmseo,hnpdu3z,hnpdu3z,Teleport change in PBE,chubs11,12/08/2021,1,I guess its just kinda hard to separate lane and role. Because if mid is ahead your entire team gets ahead. But if you have a winning bot lane you can still easily lose the game from the enemy mid being ahead.

rbmseo,hnpf4uw,hnpf4uw,Teleport change in PBE,Nahkriiin,12/08/2021,3,FINALLY someone with a brain. they complain about brush tp then dont overextend ask your toplaner if he has tp up or use red trinket/control wards to secure that.

rbmseo,hnphn50,hnphn50,Teleport change in PBE,Icretz,12/08/2021,2,So basically aggressive botlanes should never be played because if you do you will be TP camped bot. Maybe for once you shouldnt pick your botlane with the guarantee that the top will tp in to help early. Maybe match the picks and go head to head. It would be nice for once to have a botlane skirmish without being afraid of mid top tp with the first aggressive play you make.

rbmseo,hnpde9b,hnpde9b,Teleport change in PBE,Snoo8331100,12/08/2021,0,It has its advantages and disadvantages. On one hand you may get some gold for yourself but on the other your top lane counterpick can get multiple plates and waves for free and probably get more gold and xp than you will making the lane even more miserable. If your teammates cant use the advantage you created with the tp then its a bit of a waste too. And if by any chance you tp and fail to get anything then its just the worst feeling ever.

Also I don’t know what’s up with you building some straw man that I said junglers weren’t coin flip I think they are annoying and coin flippy too but they can’t exactly be removed and I think the dance around vision and wave states to interact with your jungler is a lot more skill expressive and interesting than forgoing laning phase for a tp that is only worth it if you get a double kill and the only setup required is a deep ward

Just curious. Top lane is almost 90% a factor of who picks first so the other top counterpicks the other. It used to be comforting that even if you were zoned off waves by your counterpick as least you could make plays on the map using your tp. Well I guess you just sit and wait for your team to lose/win the game.

If tping bot was a bad choice I wouldnt have done it if it was a good choice now I cant do that so Im weaker.  More so if Im behind top and cant lane because thats how toplaner works now I cant even look for tps to try and do something while I load up my next netflix episode.
rbmseo,hnpumjh,hnpumjh,Teleport change in PBE,Owen_newO,12/08/2021,1,He is talking about walking past the minion wave with jungle trying to make a play. In that case a TP to the minion wave is a TP behind.
rbmseo,hnq2ih2,hnq2ih2,Teleport change in PBE,MarcosLuisP97,12/08/2021,1,That we agree on. But the solution should be to make top lane more impactful not make bot lane even more significant than it already is. It is not like top laners WANT to tp bot they have to.
rbmseo,hnqi3d3,hnqi3d3,Teleport change in PBE,NSawsome,12/08/2021,1,I don’t think anything is wrong but it’s not a coinflip having to play around bot if you get behind top it’s just how the game works
rbmseo,hnq214b,hnq214b,Teleport change in PBE,V_Dudez,12/08/2021,4,You’re not advocating to look at the game from all pov. You want to dictate the game entirely from a top laner’s pov. That’s completely different.   Also if you want to roam without being spotted walk from base. Otherwise leave it to the jungler if it is too costly for top. Not every lane needs to show up in every other lane
rbmseo,hnqcne0,hnqcne0,Teleport change in PBE,NfinityBored,12/08/2021,1,It goes back to normal after 14 minutes. If anything this benefits early game tops because they can just focus on winning their lane early through tps back to their own lane and not letting those scale tops farm. If early game tops are letting things like tryn and Jax free farm that has nothing to do with TP.
rbmseo,hnptmv9,hnptmv9,Teleport change in PBE,EvianRex,12/08/2021,2,No obviously not because for some reason you don’t think a winning top laner doesn’t also get prio for his jungler? You can just shove top wave and invade with him.  But but but the mid laner can come and fuck our play over yes they can come for a bot side invade too. Each role has different strengths and weakness they provide.You’re deliberately leaving facts out in your arguments.   The reasons they are trying this change is because 1. Tp is incredibly strong as a summoner spell.  2. It’s very dominant in pro play.  3. There has been a lot of frustrations and criticism aim at the adc role recently a lot to do with agency and they want to tackle this with making laning easier.   1 and 2 are pretty self explanatory I’ll delve into 3 a bit more. It is very common to have bot lane 2v2s evolve into 4v4s or 5v5s. Bot laners frequently get punished for doing well in the 2v2 for being better the very issue everyone hates objective bounties for.   How many times have you won top and the enemy bot lane has come top pre 14 mins to shut you down? Very very rarely is my guess. You can only look out for so many plays before eventually they catch you. It’s incredibly frustrating especially when the solo laners that tp down have their ult and aren’t a high enough level yet and they have bonus ms your only option is to die really unless your own solo laners come.   So that leads us to the vision argument if we are good at the game we would clear every ward right? Well no. That’s not how it works. It is impossible to clear every single ward that gets placed on the map. If it were there would never be a tp flank ever. Wards get missed there are 100s of different scenarios where you miss the ward and the wave is in a pushing state so you don’t have much choice. It happens that doesn’t automatically make your bot lane or their bot lane bad. It’s incredibly frustrating to play against no other lane has this issue. At worst top lane you may have to deal with a jungler AND a mid showing up. But everyone has to look out for Jung ganks and mid roams. Bot is the only lane where a 5v5 pre 14 is actually a concern other than rift herald but the odds of all four bot laners showing up to rift in solo q is up in the air. Just how top laners want to lane 1v1 has it occurred to you bot wants 2v2?   Not being able to tp top after dying for a freeze is a blow but it’s also not some skill expressive god like thing only top laners can do like this thread is implying.   I’m on the fence about this change but you’re acting like there is no benefit to winning top and not tping bot when there 100% is.   Top is a role that’s incredibly hard to stop when it gets going. Camille Gwen Trynd Jax for a few are all impossible to deal with in a side lane if they are ahead and have immense pressure. The natural thing to do is to group and try to find fights while they side but then if your team is good and not terrible players they will never get caught out right?
rbmseo,hnpldl4,hnpldl4,Teleport change in PBE,F-b,12/08/2021,-2, >Its not realistic since botlane has two times more wards than the all the other lanes with the support constantly fighting for vision control. Only way that the toplaner can get a good TP gank on you is if you completely missed a wardoverextended and didnt see him teleporting with all off these 3 things being easily avoidable.  Rofl make an effort at least. You say we have 2 times more wards enemys botlane too and they can clear too. Ding ding ding.  Another example: you can strategically ward the alcove to watch a potential TP but in the early game youre borderline trolling if you spend your limited resource there.   Additionally I didnt know before reading you that I could mind control my lane parter and min-max their wards.

Also the main thing about Zac was that you can cheese him because he used to get really low from his first clear.

rbmseo,hnpnsu5,hnpnsu5,Teleport change in PBE,elveszett,12/08/2021,6,Yeah people often dont realize that an ability is a lot stronger than just what it does. Like Karthus R its only strength is not only that you deal x damage on demand it also has the strength that the enemy team has to play pretending they have x less HP because the threat of Karthus pressing R is always there.  That means that maybe the enemy botlane could dive you kill you and get away with it but because Karthus is in the game they wont: you just got saved by Karthus Rs existence even though he didnt even use R.  And same goes with TP just because you didnt push into enemy turret because youd be exposing yourself to a TP doesnt mean the enemy has consumed their TP. They still have it and a minute later you will once again not push into enemy turret because the threat is still there.
rbmseo,hnprs4d,hnprs4d,Teleport change in PBE,evandrew,12/08/2021,2,Is it really that hard for a support to sweep behind in the lane though? I see pros do this in solo queue all the time to allow them to push.

rbmseo,hnpv4hd,hnpv4hd,Teleport change in PBE,WiatrowskiBe,12/08/2021,5,At the same time if youre certain you can do good enough damage control to not have your own lane snowball into oblivion youre just shifting power across the map - hopefully setting 2-4 people ahead (depending if jungle and mid also join in on the party) while sentencing yourself to playing weakside. Its a tradeoff and a strategic decision right now.  Also dont forget quite a lot of midlaners also run TP and you can get a lot of mileage (numbers advantage turning 1v1 into 2v1 is far more impactful than turning 2v2 into 3v2) by strategically TPing top to then free toplaner to hotdrop botlane whenever enemy bot dares to move. As midlane TP enthusiast this change makes me sad - most cases where I managed to hard snowball was thanks to a successful TP countergank in toplane that won us entire topside of the map while enemy mid was watching my botlane farm under tower.
rbmseo,hnpo0ss,hnpo0ss,Teleport change in PBE,elveszett,12/08/2021,7,TP to bot and dying will 90% of the time mean you will lose top lane miserably and be at 50 cs at min 15.
rbmseo,hnpvpny,hnpvpny,Teleport change in PBE,Revenesis,12/08/2021,9,I didn’t say anything about supports though. I’m specifying ADC because for as long as top lane has complained about being an island ADCs for the most part haven’t been able to influence the lane. Bot lane has more impact on drag but the benefit of rift is bigger specifically for top lane than drag is for ADC. The importance of early plates and thus gold in the 1v1 top lane is more important than the dragons you get early on.    You’re mentioning the ADC shouldn’t want to miss waves I agree. But think about why it functions that way. Not only can the support beat up on the ADC early and control the lane but you’re trapped in that hellhole the entire laning phase and cannot leave for fear of losing out on exp and gold. That means when top and mid come down for the fiesta you’re at their mercy. So while I understand the problems with top lane and don’t want to minimize them I’d say playing ADC is significantly worse in terms of impact on the game. At least if you start getting ganked over and over top lane you can look for a TP play or make a play on the map and TP back. If your lane is getting camped as ADC you’re essentially praying they take the tower instead of perma denying you waves so you can at least try and freeze.     In terms of fixing top lane I feel like they should lean into the meta they’ve created and maintained for the last like 9 years. Kinda like how cloud soul makes you run faster in jungle put a speedway in the top lane against the edge of the map leading up there. Not as fast as cloud rift but like a 15 MS buff from top inhib to top lane. So if you get counterpicked you’re not entirely reliant on TP to survive laning phase and can afford an extra back without as much of a cost. Put it against the wall so it’s not efficient for junglers to use to get back to their topside camps.
rbmseo,hnpzao5,hnpzao5,Teleport change in PBE,Threeedaaawwwg,12/08/2021,1,> whilst herald isnt as impactful most of the time and takes much longer to spawn.  I wonder what the impact of swapping their locations occasionally would be.
rbmseo,hnq102m,hnq102m,Teleport change in PBE,Revenesis,12/08/2021,2,Close.   ADCs trade late game tower and objective taking ability for early game victimization. Is the average iron bronze gold and even plat Support babying the ADC? Or are they playing engage supports and coin flipping the lane or playing enchanters and standing behind the ADC while he fights to farm or leaves the lane to go do other shit? This idea of supports babying the ADC hasn’t been valid in years. Also that inability to protect themselves and DPS doesn’t suddenly appear in the late game. You’re still going to get one shot by the meta top laners when they get on you and praying your team continues to try and protect you. The problem with the role is the complete lack of agency. Why learn how to properly kite and use galeforce/qss perfectly and still get blown up when you can play literally any other role and often just have to press 4 buttons to kill someone?

rbmseo,hnqb7lz,hnqb7lz,Teleport change in PBE,RDozzle,12/08/2021,1,Jungle prioritising dr over herald is giving gold away and winning mid gives you huge map control relative to top/bot
rbmseo,hnpteuy,hnpteuy,Teleport change in PBE,Merkantum,12/08/2021,1,How often does it happen before min 14? Well they could reduce the dead time to 12 or 10 min fine by me. But the amount of bot lane fiesta is too much atm. At least thats my opinion. Maybe they even think about disabling tp to minions or ward only. just to put some limitations
rbmseo,hnpyjhv,hnpyjhv,Teleport change in PBE,Sea-Selection-399,12/08/2021,1,You influence the game as a top laner by first winning lane. If you cant do that or at least go even then your influence is gone. The difference being winning lane in top will generally make you the strongest champion in the game at that time. Being 2-3 levels ahead of everyone while playing hard carry champs like irelia/fiora etc is your influence. You act like top lane is down in cs/levels and now that TP is gone has zero agency while also ignoring that a 1-9 irelia can still 1 shot a fed ADC. Thats youre influence.  IF you need to TP bot and hope to get free gold because your botlane got shit on and are now dead/pushed in then you are just not good at top lane.  &#x200B  The fact that you say top lane champs have no influence without TP while ignoring that top lane champs have been by far the strongest in the game for a while now only tells me you gotta be pretty low ELO. Just being a 3-0 aatrox/morde/irelia/fiora/jax/tryn/ETC/ETC means no one is 1v1ing you and you can put pressure anywhere you want. Thats your influence.

rbmseo,hnpyxt2,hnpyxt2,Teleport change in PBE,WorstTactics,12/08/2021,1,Ok I think I didnt start on the right foot. I dont disagree with the TP change and it *is* the most impactful summoner spell atm but my problem stems from the fact that this change alone is a bad idea. TPing  bot can be very risky a lot of the time and it is a strategic choice. Creating a freeze toplane forcing your opponent who just killed you to burn his own TP or suffer is not healthy and I agree.  Ignite definitely is more one sided and less impactful. But it has been unnecessarily buffed to the point where it can help you win a trade you were hard losing. And that is not cool especially in SoloQ. Also for the first time ever I believe mobile champs such as Camille prefer to pick Ignite over Flash because it really is that strong.
rbmseo,hnqfda3,hnqfda3,Teleport change in PBE,Literally_Damour,12/08/2021,1,And youre playing Aatrox. And your adc is afk. And your mid laner is playing a mage. Good luck clearing the wave

rbmseo,hnpeg4n,hnpeg4n,Teleport change in PBE,Jedclark,12/08/2021,2,I wish TP didnt activate until a certain time in the game. Its so annoying how you can solo kill someone but be worse off for the next few minutes because they took TP and you didnt. Its too much of a get out of jail free card for me.
rbmseo,hnpdymf,hnpdymf,Teleport change in PBE,signmeupreddit,12/08/2021,0,stopwatch is impactful mostly in pro games where 1 kill can determine who goes on to win the next 15 minutes of objectives and if you couldnt use stopwatch as a component for other items i dont think most players should even buy it because theyre unlikely to get their moneys worth. Plus its frustrating because you feel bad about being denied a kill even if its -350g trade for the stopwatch user most soloq games.   TP scroll (like in dota) wouldnt have either of these problems it would mostly expand macro options.
rbmseo,hnqg5hx,hnqg5hx,Teleport change in PBE,PhantomRager,12/08/2021,1,Well I honestly disagree but thats because these changes nerf toplane agency and I am biased because I am a toplaner and you are biased because you are a botlaner.   I mean sure. cant wait for season 17 when toplaners play on a different map for the first 20 minutes because its frustrating for botlane because you cant just Unga bunga and win the game by winning a 2v2. I thought its a game played by 5 people on each team and not 2 but since its frustrating this should be a good step in the right direction.
rbmseo,hnptz8c,hnptz8c,Teleport change in PBE,BEER_IN_CEREAL,12/08/2021,0,As somebody who was hardstuck bronze/silver for a few seasons you are wrong. It is a team game if you just play for yourself the game will be lost around you before you even have a chance to do anything.   Im not suggesting macro plays Im suggesting spreading more gold amongst your team once you are ahead because it is more efficient. Such as: Allowing them to take kills letting them get last hits when pushing lanes moving away from towers so they can get solo plates letting them push alone when safe for solo experience.
rbmseo,hnqd1pn,hnqd1pn,Teleport change in PBE,BEER_IN_CEREAL,12/08/2021,1,People also think they dont belong at the rank they are at. The people in your games will be somewhat the same skill level as you you can rely on them as much as you can yourself.   I feel too many people have main character syndrome. They think they need to be the carry every game to win. Id rather two teammates get half an item each over getting an item myself when I am already ahead.   >  I agree with others that I need to learn to carry  One of the most important skills Ive learnt since S4 is learning to be carried.   The best way to carry isnt to 1v5 its to help your team get ahead so you can 5v5 them easily.
rbmseo,hnqc93y,hnqc93y,Teleport change in PBE,Hipster_Lincoln,12/08/2021,1,cos u will astro lose lane if u kill them and they tp to a minion which isnt hard to do

I want you to go to your match history and find me games where the enemy top was 3 levels ahead of you _and it mattered when he teleported botlane_.  Can top be ahead three levels of bot?   Yes he can but that means he likely never teleported bot and hardstomped his lane leaving you alone. Or you were botlane overextended at minute 25 for some reason in which case learn basic macro.

rbmseo,hnpg1kj,hnpg1kj,Teleport change in PBE,DC_Flint,12/08/2021,7,because toplane doesnt have a separate champ whose entire purpose is to protect _the other champion_ on the lane. You have twice the wards bot because there are two champions making it harder to gank there early.  Meanwhile there are 10 different paths to toplane and I cant possibly ward them all. Hell I cant even keep a SINGLE path warded permanently without a pink. If you ward for the 2:55 gank the ward wont be there after jgl either swept it or cleared two camps and returns.  Getting snowballed on top is so much harsher than bot.
rbmseo,hnpedee,hnpedee,Teleport change in PBE,DC_Flint,12/08/2021,10,> Normal 1v1 and 2v2 lane state  Except for jungle interference because fuck other lanes impact :)   Restrictions for thee but not for me.

rbmseo,hnpdyou,hnpdyou,Teleport change in PBE,Condomonium,12/08/2021,4,So then what exactly are you supposed to do when your bot lane is behind and constantly pushed under tower as a top laner? Wave and smile? Because tping to help is now out the fucking window.   Guess it’s just gg LP coinflip every game based on whose bot is better.
rbmseo,hnq8c11,hnq8c11,Teleport change in PBE,MegamanX195,12/08/2021,1,Thats not how it works at all nothing says the other top laner has to TP as well. if you just stay you can shove 2-3 waves under tower and take a few plates putting them massively behind unless they take a double kill.
rbmseo,hnpypqh,hnpypqh,Teleport change in PBE,Mahelas,12/08/2021,1,Yeah thats a team game. Top also have to monitor jungle ganks and mid/support roams
rbmseo,hnq2a0t,hnq2a0t,Teleport change in PBE,AalfredWilibrordius,12/08/2021,0,Yes thats how every role works. The main difference is that bot lane gets two people for vision and to look at the map.
rbmseo,hnpmse2,hnpmse2,Teleport change in PBE,Radiant_Shelter688,12/08/2021,2,Aggressive botlanes can be played for 5 minutes after the toplaner used his TP.
rbmseo,hnqcnsn,hnqcnsn,Teleport change in PBE,AalfredWilibrordius,12/08/2021,1,Youre saying this as if solo laners can tp at any time (they cant stopping a tp exists and if the tp goes through without a good wavestate you can easily lose 2 waves + 2 plates making tping bad. Plus cooldowns exist and chat exists to time cooldowns)   Youre saying this as if sweeper doesnt exist to cover your rear when you push up  Youre saying this as if pushing up and extending in the lane is the only way to play agressively in the lane when its not even the best way to do so try freezing some time.
rbmseo,hnpikbs,hnpikbs,Teleport change in PBE,JustJohnItalia,12/08/2021,12,--> free tp  --> 12 years cooldown you lose 3 platings and 2 waves
rbmseo,hnpd6ui,hnpd6ui,Teleport change in PBE,PureImbalance,12/08/2021,7,oh no I have to be calculated in my aggression   Maybe learn to bait all ins and disengage or keep track of enemy support warding far bush. If the enemy toplaner TPs but gets nothing for it (which often enough happens) he will be set behind and your toplaner will get ahead. This translates to pressure on Topside which favours your aggression for the next 6 minutes as their Jungler has to make some tough choices.    ADC players truly are toddlers that just want to live their powerfantasy instead of thinking about macro play.

rbmseo,hnpfmic,hnpfmic,Teleport change in PBE,sensei256,12/08/2021,-9,Yes because if I have Camille in my flair that means she is the only champ I ever play. Lmao.
rbmseo,hnq4dxt,hnq4dxt,Teleport change in PBE,Radiant_Shelter688,12/08/2021,1,Giving toplaners a say in the most important lane is exactly how you make toplane impactful. Your toplaner correctly managing the wave and having prio gives you TP advantage over your enemy the same way a good jungler with correct pathing gives you advantage the same way mid prio gives you advantage. Deleting this renders toplaners useless.  Botlane will always be the core important lane because:  \-Drake.  \-Potential for multi-kill.
rbmseo,hnq4utf,hnq4utf,Teleport change in PBE,Radiant_Shelter688,12/08/2021,1,What youre asking for is so unrealistic Im starting to think youve never played toplane in your whole life.  A midlaner has to shove the whole lane for him to freely roam bot you think a toplaner can just back for 8 seconds then walk from base all the way to botlane JUST for a potential play ?  >Not every lane needs to show up in every other lane  So literally every role in the game has a say in the most important lane of the game except toplane and yet Im the one not advocating to look at the game from all pov.
rbmseo,hnpyp3h,hnpyp3h,Teleport change in PBE,Radiant_Shelter688,12/08/2021,0,>No obviously not because for some reason you don’t think a winning top laner doesn’t also get prio for his jungler?  I never denied that youre the one who denied winning bot doesnt put the enemy jungler in danger. The jungle prio for a toplaner and a support are drastically different. One is a champion who can sometimes help the jungler in a skirmish the other is a roaming champion who creates and deletes vision at the same time. One is a champion with an opponent who can shove the wave and get plates if he leaves lane the other doesnt even care about XP. Drastically different.  >yes they can come for a bot side invade too.   Except a botlane being ahead means TWO people are ahead instead of one which is a huge difference.  >There has been a lot of frustrations and criticism aim at the adc role    recently a lot to do with agency and they want to tackle this with    making laning easier.  If this is an agency problem then they should specifically BUFF toplane because it has such little agency apart from early TPs that its the 2nd least played role after support in higher elos.  >How many times have you won top and the enemy bot lane has come top pre 14 mins to shut you down?   0 because its useless youve disproven your own point. And if youre going to say that its because it takes too long midlaners dont roam top either they specifically roam bot because it has a much bigger impact. The only time they roam top is if there is absolutely nothing to do bot. Going top in solo queue is a waste of time and dont talk about pro play because it has nothing to do with solo queue.  >you’re acting like there is no benefit to winning top and not tping bot when there 100% is.  Im not saying theres no benefit to winning top Im saying its the least important of wins. If you win top it just means you won top and possibly herald if your jungler decides to path to you at the right time the jungle prio is so negligible because a toplaner cannot just afford to move like a support would and youre acting like every toplaner has the ability to clear an entire wave in two buttons. If you win bot youre throwing an avalanche on the entire team and youre now in control of tempo. The game now is in your hands the only way to comeback is for you to make a mistake. (Not using your lead misplaying and giving a shutdown etc)  >Camille Gwen Trynd Jax for a few are all impossible to deal with in a side lane if they are ahead and have immense pressure.  Ignoring the fact that one of those specifically moved out of toplane for very mysterious reasons huh. This argument makes no sense. Id much rather have to deal with a simple split-pusher than deal with a fed ADC with shieldbow being peeled in a teamfight.  The hilarious part is that youre advocating for the crippling of two thirds of a whole lanes roster because you cant deal with some champions in late game. Because yes most toplaners fall off in late (Mostly tanks) and NEED that early TP to be useful. There is absolutely 0 reason to pick champions like Renekton now who revolve around starting a snowball in early to end the game as quickly as possible.  Game length is on average 30 minutes were talking about crippling a whole lane for half of the game. If farming for 14 minutes was enough for you to win the game toplaners wouldnt take TP and would just go with laning power. They dont because its not enough.
rbmseo,hnq6v2d,hnq6v2d,Teleport change in PBE,NfinityBored,12/08/2021,1,Its a lost fight. Top laners will never be able to see this from a bot perspective.   They complain about oh so now we are just supposed to sit there and hit tower and stay in lane like a good little top? When bot has been forced to be the just sit there and avoid jungle ganks mid roams mid tps top tps but also dont lose to their enemy bot and also dont go for kills because then youll get tpd on and also be our main source of damage despite the fact anyone can kill you by sneezing on you and you are 2 levels down. And if you arent you are garbage for years.   All we ask of top Laners is maybe just stop fighting them in lane when they are 0-8. But now we are expected to play perfectly the entire game and constantly play around a mechanic that auto decides our lane for us.   Now that its gone for the first 14 minutes and actually allows and promotes skill expression in Lanes again they have an issue. Top laners are a different breed.
rbmseo,hnpbf5c,hnpbf5c,Teleport change in PBE,PureImbalance,12/08/2021,4,This risk is exactly why using TP in this way is a way of expressing skill. Recognizing/Creating a good opportunity for you to TP is something to learn and improve on. This change just removes a strategic dimension because botlane cant be arsed to sweep behind them/not overextend.
rbmseo,hnpd63b,hnpd63b,Teleport change in PBE,JustJohnItalia,12/08/2021,9,But what are you saying though. Look at Adam.  https://gol.gg/players/player-stats/3489/season-ALL/split-ALL/tournament-LEC%20Summer%202021/champion-ALL/  Look at the champions he plays.  Tell me fnatic isnt botlane oriented and toplane isnt the weakside in their strategy.  That was the whole reason the team got tilted into oblivion when upset left in the middle of worlds because their strategy (like many other teams since dragon souls) was to sac everything in favor of botlane.  If you cant even agree to that then idk what game are you playing where toplane isnt the role that declines the most in playrate the higher you climb (which is an actual statistic the higher the elo the more garbage it is the less people play id look it up on league of graphs).

rbmseo,hnqk3xh,hnqk3xh,Teleport change in PBE,KingFredo5674,12/08/2021,1,Bot lane is a duo lane so of course theyre always going to be underleveled in comparison to all the other lanes. Thats just the way it works which is why at higher elos the support leaves the adc so they can soak up more exp and get to level 6 earlier.

You need to understand the number 1 factor of people in High elo to hate one tricks is legit this when you have a gaming session of like 6 games you can have 6 games in a row playing vs the same person on the same champion and is annoying as fuck especially if is against someone that plays weird like Thebaus/the Kayn top/etc... League is a video game sometimes you want to have fun you know playing vs one tricks is annoying when you want to chill because depending on the one trick he will chop your head off if you do a fuck up that is matchup specific is stressful and when you are stressed everything else annoys you more.

As of now botlane has 1 extra invisible threat than toplane which is the TP from toplane so your coment makes no sense.  After this TP change there will both be even in invisible threats. Note that any toplaner can still gank bot and TP back to their tower after the gank to not lose cs/xp. It just requires more skill and planning than pressing TP the second the enemy Thresh lands a hook.  This chance incentives aggressiveness bot its good for the game whether or not toplaners need compensation in other areas.
rbmseo,hnq0xpw,hnq0xpw,Teleport change in PBE,Lamprophonia,12/08/2021,5,Correct me if Im wrong but it feels like one argument is that it isnt fun as a botlaner when all 5 roles on the enemy team have agency over you.  You have no say on if or when either toplaner will TP either jungler will walk with mid bot to 4v2 etc.  It discourages active play.  If you catch the enemy support make a mistake and force a fight maybe you kill the support and chase the ADC back to tower you are now punished for playing well by having the enemy top TP behind you with a 2 level advantage and/or the enemy JG chasing you down also with a level advantage.  Winning a fight just turned into a huge loss.  How does that make any sense?  Shouldnt winning a fight be rewarding not punishing?  When the only way to not int and get flamed is to just... afk farm minions?
rbmseo,hnpz4pk,hnpz4pk,Teleport change in PBE,moshercycle,12/08/2021,1,People dont use risk vs reward they just tunnel vision on minions and say jg diff when they get ganked 3 times. After their jungler pings/types that jg is on their side of the map and the enemy jungler walks over 2 wards. People dont try to get better they just try to point the fault.
rbmseo,hnq77oa,hnq77oa,Teleport change in PBE,shinazueli,12/08/2021,1,If that was the case then the change is obviously unnecessary.
rbmseo,hnqbqda,hnqbqda,Teleport change in PBE,ApplicationHorror483,12/08/2021,1,That doesnt make the lane useless. If you have to exploit arbitrarily under leveled players on the enemy team to play your lane and have an impact then either   1) your lane has a whole host of problems balance wise that need to be addressed while this nerf is still entirely justified because its not designed as a nerf to top but instead a buff to bot  2) you are not very good at your lane   Also this is only a nerf for top laners who want to gank bot aggressively instead of pushing. This is simultaneously a buff for a wide array of top laners who never ran TP.
rbmseo,hnpzx2p,hnpzx2p,Teleport change in PBE,EldtinbGamer,12/08/2021,1,Exactly
rbmseo,hnpzh2e,hnpzh2e,Teleport change in PBE,naheulbeukzantar,12/08/2021,2,Thats fair I considered botlane as a whole but its true adc specifically mostly has to stay in lane aside from going to help JG with drake/jungle fights.  Idk I always felt like adc staying in lane to get as much farm as possible to hit powerspikes as fast as possible was just part of the role but I guess it doesnt have to be.  I feel like in terms of impact on the game on a whole though an ahead adc will have more impact than an ahead top laner at least in coordinated play. But this could be wrong now.  A stat Id be very interested in seeing is win rate by gold lead on opposite laner @14 for each role see which role had the most impact when ahead.
rbmseo,hnq0sg1,hnq0sg1,Teleport change in PBE,EldtinbGamer,12/08/2021,8,It would just lead to laneswap meta again which is even more terrible for toplaners.
rbmseo,hnq0k3f,hnq0k3f,Teleport change in PBE,naheulbeukzantar,12/08/2021,2,Thatd be interesting. Thing is its not so much that herald is worse than dragon (rather 1 herald is usually worth more than 1 dragon) but once you start racking them up you clearly see the différence so you want your winning side to be dragon side to get them and you want the lane with 2 people in it to be the one to win so likely we would just see top and bot swapping lanes if they keep the same timers.
rbmseo,hnq5n5j,hnq5n5j,Teleport change in PBE,Lors2001,12/08/2021,1,Adcs can output the most consistent dmg in the game if protected and not completely out of the game is why. Also it seems like youre an adc main and queue with a lot of bad supports so you hate supports or something but the majority of the time supports do babysit the adc. Whether it be the caster slowly poking the enemies down the hook champ pulling a free adc or squishy enemy to you or the enchanter preventing you from being poked down and buffing you up theyre what keep you in the lane and get the opponent out of the lane.   The whole point of the role is youre playing the highest risk and highest reward role in the game. If you play a teamfight properly and your team plays around you then you should just win the fight super easily.

rbmseo,hnqj6wp,hnqj6wp,Teleport change in PBE,evandrew,12/08/2021,1,Winning lane doesnt always mean youre 2-3 levels ahead man. You can win lane and be a level ahead and still struggle to influence the game without TP. If the expectation for top to influence the game is to be 2-3 levels ahead of the opposing top laner youre rarely going to have top influencing the game since top doesnt generally get gapped that hard in higher elo.
rbmseo,hnpxchu,hnpxchu,Teleport change in PBE,Mornos,12/08/2021,6,Yeah it was Clid who was the best Lee Sin at least I had ever seen (until Canyon this year).  When players dont know about game mechanics it leads to suboptimal gameplay. And not knowing your abilities is obviously a huge mistake. If you dont know the execute on Lee Sins Q it becomes difficult to calculate when another champ might be lethal.   Knowledge about mechanics is not just trivia it is how you make strategies and figure out how to play the game.

What kind of pro games are you watching? Stopwatch is being bought only for the active before a crucial fight all the time??  >Plus its frustrating because you feel bad about being denied a kill even if its -350g trade for the stopwatch user most soloq games.  A kill isnt just 300g thats extremely reductive. In a teamfight oneshotting someone is the difference between winning or losing the entire game.  >TP scroll (like in dota) wouldnt have either of these problems it would mostly expand macro options.  And that would have A LOT of the downstream effects we see with TP today. Such as risky trades being really rare because anyone can TP at any time...
rbmseo,hnqhbz0,hnqhbz0,Teleport change in PBE,ThePreposterousPear,12/08/2021,1,If doesnt even nerf top agency it stops you from losing lane when you solo kill your opponent and then they TP on a minion before you shove. You have more tools to win your lane now. If you picked the losing top you werent going to TP bot anyway so what does it matter?
rbmseo,hnqfp7p,hnqfp7p,Teleport change in PBE,thrownawayzs,12/08/2021,1,by far and away the easiest way out of low elo is brute forcing with 1v9 champs. yes passing gold to your team will help you win also but nobody knows how to play the game so the better play is to assume that they dont know how to use the gold.
rbmseo,hnqf4h0,hnqf4h0,Teleport change in PBE,MawrCalleach,12/08/2021,1,Oh I definitely belong in bronze rn. I have a lot to learn and I didnt want to come off as a person who needs to be the guy to be satisfied with victory. I pick fast wave clear with useful ultimates or a ton of cc champs to be easy to carry even when behind and try to make decisions accordingly. It is a 5v5 game. The problem is just recently I threw a game where I was like 12/2 at lets say 20mins but didnt win because I took some stupid risks. Ended like 14/7 or maybe more deaths. That is what I mean. To use my lead and get the win when I have the lead. Ty for your insight!
rbmseo,hnq9o0i,hnq9o0i,Teleport change in PBE,PhoenixAgent003,12/08/2021,1,Yeah it can be tricky when you’re not the support. Control wards are your friends as is occasionally sitting on trinket charges until you have 2 or jusy comboing on any existing vision the test of your team throws down. Also maybe try asking for a ward so you can split push in chat.  It’s bronze soloqueue so they might not. But you take what you can get.
rbmseo,hnpgbof,hnpgbof,Teleport change in PBE,xChibiSora,12/08/2021,3,Just to add onto this be sure to ward deep in the enemy jungle(say at red buff or wraiths) so that when you do spot the enemy jungle coming top you dont HAVE to die you can back off until you see them elsewhere then put on the pressure again.  Secondly for champ pool I recommend learning tryndamere right now hes insanely strong for splitting has good kill pressure and is very easy to play to a decent level. One thing for him is dont wait until the last possible second to ult it has a very small delay that will sometimes get you killed anyway try to ult around 1/4 hp or less.
rbmseo,hnpnj6l,hnpnj6l,Teleport change in PBE,Boockel,12/08/2021,-1,Yes and I am referring to the early drakes as well? Early drakes > faster soul > faster win
rbmseo,hnpgo0t,hnpgo0t,Teleport change in PBE,cbrozz,12/08/2021,15,If youre 3 levels ahead as a toplaner its objectively incorrect to tp bot because you can dive enemy top take all plates and live inside enemy jungle topside and snowball your jungler from it which is pretty much gg on its own. Its literally the only way enemy top can comeback if he can crash a couple of waves and get some plates and you get nothing from the bot TP in return.
rbmseo,hnpyjzi,hnpyjzi,Teleport change in PBE,Hydraplayshin,12/08/2021,-3,400 SO FUCKING LOW? XD
rbmseo,hnpui84,hnpui84,Teleport change in PBE,Akaj1,12/08/2021,-1,Its not some kind of a roast its just pointless to argue with someone low elo because they dont understand shit about the game thats it. This is not about lack of map awareness lmao every bot laner is aware when a tp is up or not it just that it prevent you from winning your lane completely because at anytime the enemy top can tp and youre getting fucked by someone even in lane but still ahead in level of you which is dumb. Tp has too much impact on bot lane and it shouldnt
rbmseo,hnpg0bo,hnpg0bo,Teleport change in PBE,Iperovic,12/08/2021,-2,thats my point though I want lanes to be at a leveled state so that how I decide to impact the map actually matters and the leads that I create can translate further instead of being shut down or even avoided because of teleport
rbmseo,hnpe331,hnpe331,Teleport change in PBE,The-Devilz-Advocate,12/08/2021,-4,>So then what exactly are you supposed to do when your bot lane is behind and constantly pushed under tower as a top laner?  So then what exactly are you supposed to do when your top lane is behind and constantly getting freezed on as a bot laner? Wave and smile? Because tping to help is now out of the fucking window. /s  Point is that the reason why bot lane is important is not because the bot lane is the main carry but because of the drag. Which is why the whole TP/Ignite meta is so bad for bot lane in general. If you are going to gank botlane you should have drawbacks regardless if you win the gank or not. TPing to help at the first sign of a fight is now basically mandatory in higher elos. Its fucking annoying and makes the lane just a coinflip fiesta where the only way to win the lane is to just push waves back and fort and just let your support roam and influence top and mid.
rbmseo,hnq0775,hnq0775,Teleport change in PBE,Radiant_Shelter688,12/08/2021,2,On top of having to monitor skirmishes to find a good TP and making sure the enemy doesnt stop their TP in certain matchups.
rbmseo,hnqdj70,hnqdj70,Teleport change in PBE,mephodross,12/08/2021,1,Being down 2 lvls makes diving too easy. Let me lane to 6 atleast before I get dove over and over.
rbmseo,hnpn3t8,hnpn3t8,Teleport change in PBE,Icretz,12/08/2021,4,So what if he doesnt use it? If you play an aggressive botlane if the opponent gets then upper hand your lane phase is over so basically you cant play aggressive because of tp threat and if he does tp and kills you then you cant do anything because you just gave the opposite botlane kills and now your lane is done. Its just one poison on the other. Let botlane play botlane for at least 10 minutes of the game junglers can come mids can roam but seeing 4 vs 4 or 5 vs 5  at lvl 3 botlane is very unfun and stupid might as well play aram 5 vs 5.
rbmseo,hnqd6mq,hnqd6mq,Teleport change in PBE,Icretz,12/08/2021,1,Can you please tell me how do you sweep tribush river bush and bottom bush at level 2-3? Lol. They should just push tp on cd so at least everyone that is on a lane gets level 6 before tp engagements start. No one in pro play would do the tp ganks if they were not worth it basically TP-ing on an early botlane and killing them makes the game over and basically wins you that lane / game or otherwise no one would take that risk but atm everyone is taking that risk because two plates is nothing compared with 2 kills and pontentialy 4-6 assists.
rbmseo,hnq1jsh,hnq1jsh,Teleport change in PBE,JimTuesday,12/08/2021,3,--> Is also an entire summoner spell slot
rbmseo,hnphijy,hnphijy,Teleport change in PBE,DingoThBOY,12/08/2021,1,But the whole point is you should very rarely be interacting with bot lane anyways because it is almost never worth especially pre-14 when plates are still up anyways it was almost never worth at that point.
rbmseo,hnprmje,hnprmje,Teleport change in PBE,Kirigaya_Yuumi,12/08/2021,5,you literally just made that assumption on him too..
rbmseo,hnqbrsm,hnqbrsm,Teleport change in PBE,MarcosLuisP97,12/08/2021,1,That makes an entire lane reliant on a summoner spell and it essentially still renders you completely at the mercy of whatever is going on in the bot lane. It means you have exactly one or two opportunities to contribute to something before you go back to the island of top lane not to mention making a bot lane a Nexus Blitz very early in the game when both the ADC and the Support are at the mercy of their laners contributions.  My suggestion is not about just removing TP as a viable strategy and telling top laners to suck it its about making top lane a place that jungler and mid laners would want to go over bot lane occasionally because the existence of TP and how people are against this change proves how ultimately useless top lane is.
rbmseo,hnpbmjz,hnpbmjz,Teleport change in PBE,InspiringMilk,12/08/2021,-1,Yes but teleporting botlane isnt a free win is what I meant. It can lose you a lead if done badly.

rbmseo,hnqgwo8,hnqgwo8,Teleport change in PBE,Nikos150,12/08/2021,1,Lets be serious here how often a mid laner roams top and how often bot? Ive played my fair amount of games as top laner mid comes once every 10 games or something maybe two? In bot its like 7-8 out of 10. Support goes top even less? once every 20? (not including the part where they switch lanes). Top laner tps bot around once every 5-6 games (i know these are random numbers but i am judging from my experience). Jungler i guess is the same completely random. So its not the same threat. When mid is missing you know he by 70-80% heading bot and very few chances he goes top.  P.S forgot ofc to mention the level difference and that many times people gank on you with ulties when you are still 4-5lvl so definitely not the same threat.
rbmseo,hnqasuz,hnqasuz,Teleport change in PBE,Corsharkgaming,12/08/2021,1,The issue is that ADCs need something to stop being the free sacks of gold they are I just dont like that top lane (an already low impact role) is getting hit for it.

rbmseo,hnqcflu,hnqcflu,Teleport change in PBE,ThePreposterousPear,12/08/2021,1,If you watched pro play last year youd notice that all the fights mostly occurred with both supports fighting around top lane and both ADCs just sitting and farming 1v1 in the bot lane. Top has overtaken ADC in game impact even in the highest levels of play.
rbmseo,hnq8o41,hnq8o41,Teleport change in PBE,Revenesis,12/08/2021,1,>Adcs can output the most consistent dmg in the game if protected and not completely out of the game is why.   This is literally what Im saying. You have no agency for yourself everything youve said is based on someone else having the agency in the game. IF theyre protected. IF theyre not out of the game. The ADC has little control over either of those scenarios.   Those are all what the supports are capable of but whether you get that support or not is a coinflip. The role should be able to do things in the game without relying entirely on the other person youre laning with. For every bad support the enemy support is better in comparison so likely one of the ADCs is having a good time. Its the coinflip aspect where you cant play the game if youre getting gangbanged or your support is playing badly thats the root of the problem. While ADCs have the highest consistent DPS in the game getting to that point is not entirely in their control. This game isnt designed solely for pro play so when youre talking about SoloQ there shouldnt be a role whose winrate is entirely based on another role PLUS playing perfectly.    Youre equating reward with DPS which is not the case. Theres a reason that jungle and support have been the most broken roles for years now and those roles are often lowest on the damage charts. They control the flow of the game for the first 30 minutes without the reliance on anyone else. Yes they do less DPS but most games arent getting to the late game scenarios where things can go perfectly and the ADC might be able to play if his teammates are covering him. With the addition of plates dragon souls and the power of baron most teams are ending the games before that point. Take away this nonexistant late game damage most ADC players will not care just as long as theyre allowed to play the game before 30 mins. Remove crit entirely and have the role scale linearly I guarantee no ADC will complain if it means theyre not getting 5 manned at tower at 10 mins or getting one shot by solo laners with negative KDAs mid game and beyond.

Tp has too much impact on bot lane and it shouldnt  Why do you think toplaner can tp at any time? he cant just fuck off from his lane and waste a summ at any time otherwise he might lose a lot in lane. And as you said every bot laner is aware when a tp is up or not meaning that they should react to a tp gank resulting in toplaner failing it and wasting a summ.  Besides its no different than being aware that mid might roam bot (especially if enemy mid is some1 like TF or Galio) or jg ganking/camping bot in an attempt to prevent you from winning the lane and im assuming that not only you dont find that problematic but you also dont think gating mid/jg from ganking bot is okay either.  You are right that tp has a huge impact but so does any map play in my opinion. Preventing people from doing (and successfully pulling off) map plays isnt the way to go. Its a type of skill expression and this change just lowers it.
rbmseo,hnpg9hz,hnpg9hz,Teleport change in PBE,DC_Flint,12/08/2021,5,Yes that 5 min cd that gives your lane opponent (if he doesnt match it) 3 plates and 3 waves really fucks with .... jungle influence over lanes. Because I can do that so often.  How dare toplaners pretend to be people they should stay in their place and let the real roles decide how the game goes. Trying to save your botlane by sacrificing your own lane? Na man shut up and lose without having any chance of recourse disgusting toplane players.
rbmseo,hnpe7j5,hnpe7j5,Teleport change in PBE,Condomonium,12/08/2021,5,You’re either high or bronze if you think top being behind as opposed to bot being behind has anywhere near as much impact. Dragon soul is the win con for every. single. game. Minimum win percentage with even the shittiest dragon soul is 87%: https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/rankings/drakes  Top lane already has zero agency over whether or not the game is won this makes that even more of a problem. Now if your bot lane is behind you have ZERO chance to help them. Don’t just think of it as when you are AHEAD as a bot laner. Think of it when you are BEHIND. Now there is no one to bail you out and help your lost lane. You’re fucked.

Keep an escape ready at all times and make sure you can disengage before engaging.  Think before acting youre basically complaining because the game needs you to weigh consequences before jumping straight in.  Id much rather have this than just auto-piloting with Leona and jumping straight in whenever flash is ready and boom double kill.

It encourages way more aggressiveness 2v2 bot and more aggressiveness 1v1 top earlygame due to the horrendous TP-freeze strat now being dead.
rbmseo,hnqdbjj,hnqdbjj,Teleport change in PBE,Lors2001,12/08/2021,1,>This is literally what Im saying. You have no agency for yourself everything youve said is based on someone else having the agency in the game  I mean thats what you get for playing the role. Once again youre playing the highest risk and highest reward role. If you play well though you should either burn more of their summoners/ults to kill you letting your team win or your team peels enough for you to win the fight for them. This is also assuming the whole enemy team focuses you which isnt always going to happen and really for any champ in the game if the whole enemy team focuses you then you have no agency its just adcs are more likely to be focused because they output the most dmg and are usually the easiest to kill.    >there shouldnt be a role whose winrate is entirely based on another role PLUS playing perfectly.   Theres plenty of champions in the game that rely on their jgler to play the game as well especially into many matchups its the exact same thing. If Im playing Veigar into an assassin Im likley going to need my jgler to babysit me a little bit whether that be helping me break a freeze stopping an enemy tower dive or ganking to decrease their pressure and this really goes for all late game champs. In the late game as Veigar Im then going to need to be peeled for as well or Ill just get assassinated without much I can do. Plenty of other late game champs are like this as well Nasus Kayle Viktor and almost any champ into a pretty bad match up.  >Those are all what the supports are capable of but whether you get that support or not is a coinflip  I mean yes and no? Technically its a coin flip whether you or the enemy gets the better support however if youre better then the enemy adc you should be able to offset these differences or play around your supports strengths and win more on average. Like technically every game is a coin flip as your team fan on average be better or worse. Realistically if youre better than the opponents though you should do things like win lane more draw more pressure rotate and help more etc... that all make you win more on average.   >Youre equating reward with DPS which is not the case. Theres a reason that jungle and support have been the most broken roles for years now and those roles are often lowest on the damage charts.  Because these roles usually have cc and utility based kits... 90% of every adcs kit is literally just dmg. So adcs reward is dmg unlike support and jglers reward which can be things like longer cc faster rotates bigger shields etc... Support is more influential because its easy as a good support to carry even a mediocre adc as long as they follow up on your plays and because they often influence 2 lanes. Jungle is more influential because they influence the whole map and jg objectives.  Also there are plenty of early game adcs in the game in fact theyre usually the ones that are meta that can easily pressure lane to get early dragons. Champs like Caitlyn Trist Samira Lucian Draven and MF to name the ones off the top of my head all have a lot of early game pressure and usually early game its harder for enemy champs to get on top of you as well due to higher cooldowns and the fact that they cant one shot you. And these champs all still have really good late game output if allowed to stay alive.   Also I would say most adcs scale pretty linearly its not like one moment they do absolutely nothing and the next theyre oneshotting people usually its a pretty clear progression unless they get a huge gold boost obviously. Obviously crit may play a roll in a fight or two and I think the rng of crit in general is dumb although that applies for all champs not just adcs. Trynd getting 3-4 crits in a row at lvl 1 is just as if not more dumb.   Most games in the helps you listed last like 30 minutes. Even if youre playing a late game adc you should usually be getting pretty huge power spikes at your 2-3 items which you should be getting at 17-25 minutes respectively allowing you to start controlling games at around these points.  At the end of the day even if adc has little no agency the enemy adc has the exact same lack of agency as you. If you forget the enemy mid or jg to come bot more youre drawing pressure and should win more games on average if you play around this well even if its frustrating for you as a player.
rbmseo,hnpj5b1,hnpj5b1,Teleport change in PBE,BamaAlwaysKicks,12/08/2021,2,Gwen is a solid split pushing AP option. She is an extremely strong duelist that can 1v2 at level 6 with the healing on her ult if not earlier if you run tp ignite.   If youre not mechanically strong focus on learning simple trade patterns and csing. Aim to be at around 8-10 CS per minute but that doesnt always happen. Doesnt matter as much if youve died 3 times and have 80 cs when the other guy is 3/0 with 40.

Getting Soul is done by the team that is already winning far far more often than it is by the team that is losing so of course Soul has a high win rate. Its the same for inhibs.

rbmseo,hnqffg0,hnqffg0,Teleport change in PBE,itirix,12/08/2021,1,Im not a top laner but hear me out.  The reason for the victim complex is simply because being a victim of *any* shenanigans just feels much worse on top lane. Top is an island. An extremely snowbally island. Once youre behind chances are your impact for that game is gone.  Dont get me wrong getting dove mid or bot still feels fucking shitty especially if its 3 times in the span of 8 minutes but its not the same as getting dove top.   You get camped mid at least you get to play the map. Youre literally the center of everything. You also get to farm as the lane is much shorter unlike top. Also unlike top the champions tend to be a lot more squishy so even when behind you can always pull an equalizer off.  As far as bot goes lets be honest the game aint really in your hands until minute 25 or so. By that time its really team advantage that decides how well youre going to be doing. If you get fucked on bot and the rest of your team is doing well youre getting back in the game pretty much no matter what you do. Also bigger range helps farming so theres that. Plus not much of a point but maybe taking the dick with another person on the lane helps?? Feels like it does.  So yeah imo top DOES get the short end of the stick as far as dives / other shenanigans go.

You can still go 10/0 and win off that. Just like top laners or mid laners. Im just saying going 0/3 due to ganks on bot does not feel as bad as going 0/3 due to ganks on top because as a bot laner youre getting your chance after a certain time anyway chance is just going to be smaller if youre losing. As a top laner thats it. Youre done. Just try not to make it even worse for your team.
rbmseo,hnq5eqj,hnq5eqj,Teleport change in PBE,DC_Flint,12/08/2021,1,I was bored so I checked your claim about the top 50. Quite a convenient cutoff btw absolutely not because if you lets say take the top 100 its way more even. Top 70 even. Considering people are within 1 LP of each other this distribution of roles changes _every damn minute_.  -- 50   top 13   jgl 10   mid 14   bot 7   sup 6    -- 70    top 16   jgl 16   mid 18   bot 9   sup 12  For the record these stats mean _nothing_. Literally nothing. You could not draw any conclusions from these because the sample size is so insanely small. But it just shows how little you understand what you talk about.  I also never said top cannot carry. It can. Its just that you have way less say over games _in general_ than other roles. Carrying a game and being the one having influence in the game is not necessarily the same.

rbmseo,hnqnaqk,hnqnaqk,Teleport change in PBE,Thavralex,12/08/2021,1,Yeah thats a super realistic scenario. You know those <0.0000000001% of games where all of top jungle and mid took TP and on top of that they all synchronize at the same time on bot lane right after their opponents won a 2v2.
rbmseo,hnqlzvh,hnqlzvh,Teleport change in PBE,Diccx,12/08/2021,1,They just made a hard role harder to play and less rewarding while making an easy role even easier to play (ADC). Kinda sucks imo

rbmseo,hnqmiwq,hnqmiwq,Teleport change in PBE,NotForCrimeAccount,12/08/2021,1,The problem really isnt the lane matchup and it never was. Its that theres often no way to alleviate the 1v2 pressure if the enemy jungler has the privilege to sit on your lane because their botlane is absorbing the 2v3/2v4 or its that outside of a single TP theres no way for you to secure early dragons or apply pressure early to other lanes. Maybe mid if youre lucky or if youre really lucky you can drop into the enemy topside jungle if your mid and jungle are on the same page but the stars have to align in terms of wave crash and timing the enemy clear or theyre looking to make a play mid that you can turn and you have to be matched with someone who dont know how to play safe in top lane in the 1v1 which is kind of easy.  Being 1/0/0 while the enemy bot mid and jungle are all 3/1/5 5/0/2 or 2/1/7 and youre like welp I sure do got a 30 cs and 1.5 xp lead on this guy. Hope thats enough.

rbmseo,hnqltdt,hnqltdt,Teleport change in PBE,tanezuki,12/08/2021,1,Then you would have the botlane that stays bot shreds through the bot tower because bot tower doesnt have any bonus armor in the early game. You know they did this to avoid swap lane in the first place !
rbmseo,hnqn28b,hnqn28b,Teleport change in PBE,Random_Stealth_Ward,12/08/2021,1,Yeah but I doubt the guy meant Yone in his current state instead of Yone for being Uone. Also thats mostly because new tempo. Before that many high elo players were saying Yone was kinda bad and abusable.

rbmseo,hnqm7q2,hnqm7q2,Teleport change in PBE,Arnhermland,12/08/2021,1,If you think mid never gets 4 man dived you dont play mid
rbmseo,hnqmtpl,hnqmtpl,Teleport change in PBE,Waxburg,12/08/2021,1,I think the issue here is that youre over-valuing how much EXP the early kills actually give. Kill EXP is based off the enemies current level so (assuming the 1st/2nd kills had Rengar at level 1 while the 3rd was level 2) youd have only gotten 198XP off all 3 of them which btw isnt actually enough to even get lvl2 (level 2 is around 280xp). Most junglers can reach level 3 pretty quick iirc around 2:50 for a 3 camp clear otherwise to get level 4 around what Im assuming happened they would have had to have done a 5 camp + scuttle and the kill XP + minions bumped him over the edge to get lvl4. In most situations junglers can certainly rush a higher level than you pretty quickly but in doing so (especially if they do a 3 camp) theyd be giving up a lot of jungle xp/gold and leaving themselves to get outscaled pretty quick if their early game aggression doesnt go to plan.  I think Khazix saw you being super aggressive top side noticed the dive about to happen and ditched his clear to help Rengar which makes sense. To avoid this Id try keeping a rough idea on what side the enemy jg starts and learn a good idea of how jungle pathing works atm so you can counter it appropriately ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWVbtYw24Pc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWVbtYw24Pc) highly recommend this video btw most junglers do some variation of whats mentioned here). Not dying to jg is 90% roughly estimating what they should be doing and altering your aggression/positioning around that. Keep in mind btw junglers will always have the fastest level 3 but you out-level them pretty quickly so most instances where theyll be ganking with a level advantage will be coming in around the 2:50-3:30 spot so try to figure out which side theyre starting and how they want to path so you can avoid these gank timing that are advantageous for them.  Sorry if I came off accusatory in the original comment hope any of this info helps.

rbmseo,hnqo8fm,hnqo8fm,Teleport change in PBE,NotForCrimeAccount,12/08/2021,1,What often happens is that the enemy was in a position to punish because your botlane was pushed up and getting ganked and you TPing would barely change the outcome so going for plates is the better play. But you actually have to play to the emotional fragility of your bot/support who just sees TP timers and nothing else as they arm their context pings. That bully scenario being gone is at least a positive.
rbmseo,hnqnscr,hnqnscr,Teleport change in PBE,Diccx,12/08/2021,1,Fr it takes skill to consistently make rewarding tp plays. Top lane is hard enough this will make it even harder/less rewarding for no reason.
rbmseo,hnqo1p1,hnqo1p1,Teleport change in PBE,HatesBeingThatGuy,12/08/2021,1,Nah this is wrong. It isnt a buff to them at all. They do care about TPs. If you fuck up and kill someone at the wrong time early your wave becomes FUBARd and you are actually down tempo the rest of lane if they play it properly by TPing back immediately to freeze -> bounce it back into you. This only stops snowball roamers.

rbmseo,hnqoskz,hnqoskz,Teleport change in PBE,TitanOfShades,12/08/2021,1,Of course its fair the first few levels are the only point a jungler might have a level lead without snowballing like fuck because the jungle is designed in such a way that any clear that isnt total trolling can grant level 3. But this level lead will be lost within 10 minutes I can guarantee you. Go in the training tool and AFK farm as a jungler for 10 minutes and compare your level to a mid- or toplaner who sat in lane for the same amount. Between the changes to camp respawn timers and the scuttle changes this season junglers lost considerable amounts of XP and gold leeching XP off a laner is almost a necessity at this point.

rbmseo,hnqoym2,hnqoym2,Teleport change in PBE,Jtadair98,12/08/2021,1,Ok I agree that it sucks this happened to top but bot lane has been a terrible experience for awhile and at least being able to 2v2 early without the fear of being TPd on can let them play the game. The alternative right now is to just play safe and farm and if 1 of the solo lanes gets even a small bit ahead you are just 1 shot 0 impact until 30+ minutes which games are already decided.
rbmseo,hnqnxeu,hnqnxeu,Teleport change in PBE,TinkW,12/08/2021,1,But you are conveniently ignoring the fact that there is MUCH more vision around bot side than around top side pre 14min that makes seeing a mid roam and a jungle gank much easier.

rbmseo,hnqp728,hnqp728,Teleport change in PBE,ryanruin22,12/08/2021,1,Just make it so you cant tp to minions so theres still the opportunity to make TP plays but theres counterplay to it by sweeping brushes and such the strategy of making tp plays bot lane early shouldnt be removed it should just be harder to force and take actual prep time.  If you really want to make sure that the strategy needs prep time make a cooldown on ward tps for 4 seconds so that it doubles the time it takes for the tp to complete if you arent set up further rewarding proper set up and map play.  This compromise creates a scenario where top laners arent entirely fucked over based on counterpick but bot lane isnt constantly afraid of making plays because the enemy top laner can just tp to a nearby minion and win the fight for you. Its still a nerf to top lane since they cant creep freeze but as someone who decided to grind adc I can see a reason the change is needed.

rbmseo,hnqs5pa,hnqs5pa,Teleport change in PBE,xXStarupXx,12/08/2021,1,Yep this has been my biggest issue with changes in the game for a long time it just feels like theyre limiting options so much that you no longer have to think to play the game because there is nothing to think about you have one clear option.   Smite does the same no matter what camp you smite = you dont have to think about where to smite.  Jungle item is mandatory = youre forced to run smite even on junglers that dont need it at all.  Mythic items are basically mandatory and often a clear first item = you have basically 2 different items you can choose between buying for the first 20 min of the game on any given champ.  Items not stacking = every time you buy an item you now have less options going forward.  Only one mythic item = you now have a severely reduced pool of items to chose from after you get one mythic.   ____  The only recent change I can think off that actually felt like it encouraged explorative play and flexible options has been the runes and theyre locked to pregame choice only. As soon as the game starts you can turn your brain off.

They should overhaul the general spell or things around it but not be like: Here cant use it in the first 14min because its too strong.  Idk give it an (even) higher CD for example. Or longer channel. Making the channel last i.e. 6 seconds (just making stuff up right now) would give way more reaction time and actually make it more punishing if you dont plan carefully. Especially if the toplaner uses it reactionairy while not under his turret is basically a huge risk. More time to either get killed or stopped from porting by the enemy.
rbmseo,hnqrelm,hnqrelm,Teleport change in PBE,Dynamatics,12/08/2021,1,Successfull splitpushes are not common.

Lane ctpicks would be stronger in low elo and weaker in high elo. People would inevitably get better at laning as you have no chance to troll your lane to coinflip roam. Would be a fun game mode!
rbmseo,hnqq2bp,hnqq2bp,Teleport change in PBE,King-Of-Rats,12/08/2021,1,Typically not *maxing*  just because of how the scaling/game works.  First off Zilean E is weird in that it has diminishing returns as you level it. The only other ability I can think of that does this is Taric heal. Basically there’s a major difference going from rank 1 to 2 but not much of one from 4 to 5.   Secondly it’s far stronger outside of laning phase than it is in it. Lanes are condensed so aside from support situations it’s not being used a *ton* other than to reposition.   It’s real strength is being able to speed up your juggernauts and assassins in the mid/late game while obviously locking down enemies as you can.   So to answer your question still max Q first but I definitely like to get a second or third point into E pretty early on at least by mid game. Knowing when to do this is just a matter of practice and partly what makes the champ fun

If you do not have full resources you can take a non-crashed wave like that freeze it and back for resources + items.    Ive had it happen to me that I would leave a tank alive in a freeze and it would still be there once I got back. Enemy laner has to walk more has lost more resources than if it bounced back and the wave is in a less favorable position where you have the whole lane to run him down if you are the kind of champ that can do that

rbmseo,hnqsjmg,hnqsjmg,Teleport change in PBE,jj7878,12/08/2021,1,Deep level knowledge is valid. I’m all for people having advantages due to that. Riot just takes this too far. 150 champs 4-5x as many abilities to become familiar with endless interactions amongst the abilities and we haven’t even scratched the surface.  At the very least the wiki shouldn’t be necessary to learn the ins and outs. The client and riot need to do a better job at making it accessible.   I guess im trying to say that the real challenge should be learning the game not figuring out all of the things that you still need to learn and catch up on.

rbmseo,hnqq357,hnqq357,Teleport change in PBE,Malgus20033,12/08/2021,1,Adc players love to complain about how hard it is to 3v2 once at 20 minutes and then blame their top laner for a fed jungler. That the top laner got tower dove by volibear darius and yone for the 6th time at minute 15 does not matter tho because they’re not a jhin :( and don’t have the right to complain.
rbmseo,hnqqgjf,hnqqgjf,Teleport change in PBE,Malgus20033,12/08/2021,1,Yeah that’s why I retired from top lane and if I ever get filled I usually go Sett because of his huge 2v1 potential or Morde because he can make any gank a 1v1.
rbmseo,hnqt6sv,hnqt6sv,Teleport change in PBE,Wasteak,12/08/2021,1,I hope they have ideas how to make toplane a bit more fun before 14 min because without tp-ing bot to give free kill to the opponent adc whats the point ?

rbmseo,hnqt07l,hnqt07l,Teleport change in PBE,Snybana,12/08/2021,1,Getting a solo kill gets you 20 more xp and having a level diff gets you more or less 16% xp per lvl (if you are 1 level under you gets 16% more 2 level 2x16% more... / 1 over you get 16% less...)  Which means for example solokilling the ennemy lvl 7 midlane while lvl 6 net you aroud 500xp and red buff is 320 so just red + kill is enough to get lvl 7

rbmseo,hnqtipl,hnqtipl,Teleport change in PBE,yp261,12/08/2021,1,6 is untrue. if s champ with **smite item** kills too many minions  same goes for support item
rbmseo,hnqsvwm,hnqsvwm,Teleport change in PBE,MGRNE,12/08/2021,1,14 min is definitely too long they should drop it to 10 so that youre essentially freed up for your second TP not third.   That or they could make the range on TP increase over time so that you can only get back to top early on but can then go global after that. Then it would also keep the option of mid TP or saving Zac which is at least something strategic for TP to still have.
rbmseo,hnqt3tm,hnqt3tm,Teleport change in PBE,JohnCornewaille,12/08/2021,1,What I havent understood is why 14 minutes? I get that limiting it to towers avoid the bot lane fiestas and the instant revive freeze early game.  But 14 minutes seem such a long time that allows for 1 TP back to land and then another for the team. Why not put it before so the decision becomes TPing to lane to get an advantage or saving it and risking it on a TP bot.
rbmseo,hnqu29j,hnqu29j,Teleport change in PBE,Zac_nuts_Twitch,12/08/2021,1,According to their universe pages they are related to eachother.  Sadly that was the only thing Riot left them with.😔
rbmseo,hnqtds8,hnqtds8,Teleport change in PBE,tomius,12/08/2021,1,Then find out why that happens and find the simplest solution.  I dont usually complain about League but honestly this is kinda lazy game design.
rbmseo,hnqt8vo,hnqt8vo,Teleport change in PBE,Dynamatics,12/08/2021,1,Botlaners will complain that the enemy top tpd but will completely ignore that your own toplaner now has like 2 waves advantage and probably one or two plates too.  It happens so rarely it is the correct play to tp bot early. You will grief your own lane so hard.
rbmseo,hnqtffh,hnqtffh,Teleport change in PBE,Avrangor,12/08/2021,1,If a Caitlyn Lux cannot escape the tp gank while facing Yuumi and Ez it’s either that they are blind or in a bad position. Also bot lane is a ranged lane and has easier time escaping ganks and has two champions for vision control.
rbmseo,hnqtthp,hnqtthp,Teleport change in PBE,Dynamatics,12/08/2021,1,The same people who complain that Kat roams bot and midlane is a broken role while completely ignoring the fact that you could see Kat shove a wave walk over one ward walk over scuttle AND still die to Kat / start a fight when Kat is in vision near is too much.  I trust midlaners complaining about botlaners dying to Kat way more than botlaners calling mid broken for doing that roam.  Same goes for Qiyana Talon and all other.
rbmseo,hnqtm1t,hnqtm1t,Teleport change in PBE,lolbifrons,12/08/2021,1,Glad Im not in high elo then that sounds ass.  One yellow trinket doesnt have 100% river uptime let alone the occasional bush ward and thats assuming your adc even uses it on cooldown.
rbmseo,hnqtnnt,hnqtnnt,Teleport change in PBE,GuGuMonster,12/08/2021,1,I also think people go about Zilean the wrong way oftentimes. building him full glas cannon AP like theyre playing any other mage. If you wanted to play the annie playstayle pick annie for AoE stun burst. In my eyes the maximum value you get out of the champion is by staying alive and not having to expend your resources on yourself and Zilean players should in my eyes have that goal in mind and build and play accordingly.
rbmseo,hnqu3qs,hnqu3qs,Teleport change in PBE,xXStarupXx,12/08/2021,1,I mean they might not figure out counters but theyre not the ones figuring out these strats either. The people who do come up with new strats might find a counter or maybe there is no counter adn in that case its just the meta just like we in the current meta tend to go two people botlane
rbmseo,hnqu4pi,hnqu4pi,Teleport change in PBE,Kharn_LoL,12/08/2021,1,Not only is first drake worth a lot less than first herald but the reason why toplaners TP bot is that its practically two free kills since even a feeding toplaner will be two levels up on botlane. Do you have any idea how depressing it is to have a toplaner with R TPing to your lane while youre level 4? And theres quite literally no counterplay outside of just conceding every trade.
rbmseo,hnqu0mk,hnqu0mk,Teleport change in PBE,GuGuMonster,12/08/2021,1,depends on Support or mid. Support is usually 3 points Q and then max E.
rbmseo,hnqtzip,hnqtzip,Teleport change in PBE,Ninjahound789,12/08/2021,1,In solo queue sure that just works but weve seen that even at worlds a tp cannot always be respected  If your top laner is losing then he is down tp most likely and you as the bot lane are pressured to do something to equalize which TP made difficult since you already needed to look for opportunities where all of the following applies:  1- You can win the fight  2- The wave will be in a neutral or advantageuos spot if you trade kills  3- The enemy jungler isnt in the area or they are being matched by your jungler and the 3v3 is good for you  4- The enemy mid laner is not roaming down to help their botlane or they are being matched by your midlaner  Given how narrow those windows of opportunity can be adding a tp to the mix made passive play much more common in competitive leading to the meta of abandoning your adc and roaming (in some part there are other factors of course)  Opportunities to play aggressive were still there but they were a rarity rather than the norm

rbmn22,rbmn22,rbmn22,LP Loss mitigation needs to be addressed,RasaFormation,12/08/2021,0,You know what? Who cares if some ranks get inflated. Make new ones. Gold this season has been rough and what irritates me the most is that my early to mid game is super solid 8/10 games but I cant get the same consistency from my teams to climb. Yes I can focus on my play and mute everyone but that is part of the problem with league right now. More people are playing the game and enough people are getting good to flood gold. Between this a lack of reliable communication on engages or disengages and the occasional smurfs- its a **mess.**  If a player does well as such getting an A-S+ at end of game in a loss then there should be some mitigation or maybe even +2 +3 gains. Skill definitely averages out but even some of the top tier players suggest its a game of luck. Who is throwing their mmr? Who is smurfing? Whos on a luck streak? Whos going to go 1/4/0 in 6 minutes? Its a toss up and unrewarding.  Right now I feel I need to get a duo partner to anchor or start a fresh account to get a fresh LP situation. It appears that to climb reasonably well in gold 3 + you need to have duo and or dial in a hyper carry champ that snowballs asap. I could care less about what rank I am. Id just like to play a clean game of league with teammates more so on the same page. Not the 8/6/2 jax turret diving nexus.  \~Peace
rbmn22,hnq2z72,hnq2z72,LP Loss mitigation needs to be addressed,semango,12/08/2021,1,Im sorry to break it to you but there are no ranks where the games become clean. You will have messy games in every rank. Take this from a master tier player.  You say you don’t win games due to the inconsistency from your teammates. That’s just another way of saying that you feel better than your teammates. I can tell you that you are not. If you were significantly better than your teammates then you would easily climb ranks.  Imagine you playing in iron. Climbing there would be easy for you since you are actually better than the players in this bracket. If you significantly were better than everyone else in gold playing vs them should feel the same as playing in iron.  You might be slightly better than the average gold player but climbing becomes harder and harder the closer you get to your current theoretical highest level.   If you have any intentions of climbing get the feeling out of your head that your teammates hold you back. You should be the game deciding factor of all your games before you climb.

rbmn22,hnq1m7j,hnq1m7j,LP Loss mitigation needs to be addressed,NoFeeling9601,12/08/2021,2,No systemic change needs to happen for you to climb in gold. You just need to get better at the game. Literally nothing you say matters actually does in gold. You might lose a game purely off of your teammates every now and again but if youre not smashing lane in gold and completely smurfing on the enemy team why would you think you deserve to climb? lol

rbmn22,hnqgwbs,hnqgwbs,LP Loss mitigation needs to be addressed,MrTortaFrita,12/08/2021,1,The game wont get easier and people will still be people no matter the rank. If you are doing great in the early game but still losing you are probably doing something wrong in the mid-late game.  Not saying that MMR is great gains of 13 per win and losses of 16 per lose is pretty fucked.
rbmn22,hnq22py,hnq22py,LP Loss mitigation needs to be addressed,SoyKurple,12/08/2021,-1,This makes no sense. You need to smash gold players to deserve to climb from gold? Shouldnt being slightly better be enough to climb

His initial fight with jinx and svedka showed 3/4 things for a new champ.  1. Hoverboard 2. His orange sticky gernades 3. insane martial arts skills while on a hoverboard.  But no. The people wanted firelight ekko and firelight ekko is what they got.   A cheap 1350 skin that doesnt even give new voice lines. Is that what we wanted?  Why in the first place would ekko even break up the first meeting between powder and VI in 5 years? because he thought VI was dead? lame excuse and lame plot. They had so much potential to make a legit character matter and they just sold out for this subpar skin. In so doing they also ruined ekkos lore as a champion  I needed to know I could trust you. is that why he spike vi over the head with a lead pipe? because he needed to trust her?  IF ekko is the firelight leader so be it. But dont disrespect the fanbase by cheapening his entire lore making him the tragic character in Vi and Jinxs lore just so you can release a subpar below average skin and tell us it makes sense. I want more.  &#x200B  Am I the asshole here? I feel not but maybe fanbase is just thinking ekko go brrrr and nothing else.  &#x200B  IDK man. but after watching Arcane. that is NOT the ekko skin I envisioned.

rbla2p,rbla2p,rbla2p,"Is the ""Recomended"" tab good?",PastelLicuado,12/08/2021,1,I am kinda new to the game and dont really want to learn every item in the game just yet its boring so i tend to use apps like blitz for runes and buying but with this i dont learn anything and sometimes when the app fails to load or something im left with shit runes and not knowing what to buy because i blindly buy what it tells me so with recommended i should be able to see what helps with what champion and what it does (anti tank anti healing health regen etc).  So to the point what i mean with the title is if what the recommended tab says is accurate / how accurate it is like for example thing like the labels it puts on items like Ramping Damage Anti-Physichal Anti-disable Heal amp Anti-healing etc and also is it accurate when it recommends champions that its good against?
rbla2p,hnowy0o,hnowy0o,"Is the ""Recomended"" tab good?",JuujiNoMusuko,12/08/2021,7,Its pretty goodand it also eases you in on thinking what to build for the current gamestaterather than blindly following a build.  Iirc the items are not hardcoded inrather they are selected based on data riot has gathered from other playersso for sure you are not going to get anything too bad.
rbla2p,hnoxcs7,hnoxcs7,"Is the ""Recomended"" tab good?",MrWedge18,12/08/2021,3,Yes the recommended tab is very accurate. It uses actual player data just like Blitz and other third-party websites/software.   The only difference is the recommended tab is one patch behind while third-party sources use data from the current patch. It should be fine 99% of the time though
rbla2p,hnoz81w,hnoz81w,"Is the ""Recomended"" tab good?",Rustifer66642069,12/08/2021,1,Recommended isnt terrible just pay attention to what and why you are buying

rbla2p,hnpddfe,hnpddfe,"Is the ""Recomended"" tab good?",00Dandy,12/08/2021,1,Yes the recommended items are based on items that high ranked players buy frequently and it shows you which items work well against the enemy champions.  So if you are unsure just buy the recommended items. But you can also just copy item builds (and runes) from sites like OP.gg u.gg and mobafire.
rbla2p,hnp6a1p,hnp6a1p,"Is the ""Recomended"" tab good?",MooseMaster3000,12/08/2021,0,Yes. Alongside the item update this year they updated the recommended item system. Now instead of fixed sets it updates live per patch.  Usually you’ll wanna follow the items at the bottom of the recommended tab as the live game system is still clunky and might tell you to build armor when the enemy it says it’s good for is going magic damage.
rbla2p,hnpa7cw,hnpa7cw,"Is the ""Recomended"" tab good?",Nubi_Princess,12/08/2021,0,I can only recommend you to learn the items. For me it feels like a lot of games depends on choosing the right items. Like when I see enemy team comp I think of a couple items I need this game and then Ingame every time I buy I check enemy team to see who’s fed. Or generally how the games plays out. I can Splitpush? Great I may go hullbreaker. I want to split but I can’t really cause my team has 0 pressure and if I try to I get gangbanged with 3 to 5 people? Ok no splitpush 4 me

rbla2p,hnp1fg9,hnp1fg9,"Is the ""Recomended"" tab good?",JuujiNoMusuko,12/08/2021,4,If i understand the question correctlyits because most champions have more than 1 thing that you might want to itemize againstif for example you are playing against a vladimirwho not only deals a lot of magic damagebut also heals a lotyou might want to build magic resist(to counter his damage)or healing reduction(to nullify a bit if his healing)
rbla2p,hnpw82u,hnpw82u,"Is the ""Recomended"" tab good?",ColdFire252,12/08/2021,1,But my ad fiddle diddle mid :(    Jk I have no clue why this exists either
rbla2p,hnozgbx,hnozgbx,"Is the ""Recomended"" tab good?",MrWedge18,12/08/2021,3,Easy answer is yes. Buy it when full build.  More complicated answer: it can be a good idea to buy them during do or die situations. Like when the enemy is in your base trying to end the game an elixir is a relatively cheap power boost for defending.  > Also if I get killed I lose the elixir right?   No Im pretty sure the elixir stays even if you die. Itll just keep ticking towards the time limit. You can also use an elixir while dead and the timer wont start until you respawn.
rbla2p,hnp7p4d,hnp7p4d,"Is the ""Recomended"" tab good?",MooseMaster3000,12/08/2021,2,Elixirs stay through death and if you buy one while dead the duration wasted while dead is added to it so you don’t actually lose any.   Buy it when you’re full build OR when it looks like the next fight might win the game for you or the enemy. Just remember to activate it if you aren’t full build.
rbla2p,hnp6y0j,hnp6y0j,"Is the ""Recomended"" tab good?",MooseMaster3000,12/08/2021,1,I mean in the recommended tab at the bottom it shows “frequently bought” items underneath the 2-3 items in the big rectangles it recommends to build next. Basically just build those in order and you’ll usually be fine.
rbla2p,hnpedq8,hnpedq8,"Is the ""Recomended"" tab good?",saura00,12/08/2021,3,I would say if you expect to fight for drag or an objective after say drag 2 or baron at all...buying one is almost always worth it

rbl7o2,rbl7o2,rbl7o2,Any tips for a new player?,RetekMester,12/08/2021,0,Hello I have recently started playing the game and I just wanna ask for some tips and advices. I play jungle or at least Im trying to but there are so many things Im not confident about I dont really know when and how to position myself to gank or just in general and Im kinda afraid to go with my gut because Im scared that my teammates are gonna shit on me and so I just wander around aimlessly and fall behind in levels so badly. The other thing is whenever I feel like I had a good game I just check the stats and they dissapoint me. Could anyone give some advice or something?
rbl7o2,hnoxpgb,hnoxpgb,Any tips for a new player?,KarolvPL,12/08/2021,2,Honestly just win best advice i ever got. Not dying also helps.
rbl7o2,hnp0ack,hnp0ack,Any tips for a new player?,JuujiNoMusuko,12/08/2021,2,I honestly suggest you try roles for the beginning at leastbecause:   1.Jungle probably requires the most knowledge about the game than any other roleand a lot of it you cant just sit down read a guide and learnrather you can only pick up by playing a fair amount.  2.Jungle plays way diferently than all other rolesand pretty much none of the skills you hone as a jungler translate into the other roleswhich means if you start playing only jungle you miss on developing basic skills like csingtrading in lanewave management etc.   If you still want to try jungling here are some basic tips:  * Be sure to check what your champions identity is: Champions like Xin Zhao or Jarvan IV excel at gankingmeaning you should prioritize it over farming the jungle monsters(That of course doesnt mean that you should not farm at allbut rather that it isnt your highest priority)while champions like Viego or graves are really good at both clearing the jungleand using the steady stream of gold and exp they get as they scale really well with items(againyou should also gank with thembut only when the play is a guarantee).  * No matter what champion you are playing it is really important to that you path correctlyfor starters you want to be clearing your jungle camps in the most efficient way**you want them to stay alive for the least amount of time**in order to maximize your exp/gold gain from them.You also must make sure that you dont just blindly clear from one camp to anotheryou have to have a sort of gameplan in your mind when deciding towards where you are going to clear toif the dragon for example is spawning in a little bityou want to be there as it spawnsso you are going to clear from top->bot.  * Getting the trinket Oracle Lens is really importantas just using it to know if a bush is warded while you are trying to gankand also clearing the aforementioned vision for future ganks is really important for you in order not waste any time.  * If you see the enemy jungler doing somethingyou must think what is the most appropriate way to respond:You see them ganking the botlanethat leaves you with some choices:You can countergank the lane they are ganking to turn the tidesyou can gank another lane to apply pressureyou can get an objective while they are busy or you can just steal some of their camps.just remember there is not always a right answer.  * If you think you cant handle your teammates flaming youjust disable chat/mute them at the beginning of the game.Its sad that this is how it isbut dont lose your sanity over itno reason tomost of the time the information that you might need is communicated through pings anyway.  * If a laner is spam pinging you to gank even though it puts you in a compromising positionyou should probably just ignore himespecially if you are playing soloas the person you can rely the most on is yourself anywayand not a random teammate.
rbl7o2,hnoy0nr,hnoy0nr,Any tips for a new player?,Missmedli,12/08/2021,1,[https://jungler.gg/](https://jungler.gg/)  This site has item builds ability level order and pathing for every effective jungle champion. Search for your main and learn the routes.
rbl7o2,hnoykf3,hnoykf3,Any tips for a new player?,Raynar7,12/08/2021,1,The best junglers know how lanes work. You cannot ever properly gank a lane if you don’t know what’s the state of it.   Learn the lanes at least a bit before you switch to jungle. You can of course “read about it” but getting first hand experience is always better.
rbl7o2,hnp4aad,hnp4aad,Any tips for a new player?,HandDrawnHarriette,12/08/2021,1,Jungles a pretty difficult role to pickup and play. Youve gotta have a good understanding of a lot of things about the game to perform effectively from the role. But as some quick-tips to get better:     1. narrow down to about 3-5 Champions you really enjoy 2. Learn those Champions routes/pathing (the way they like to clear the Jungle) 3. Gank and play around enemy movement abilities and summoner spells (Flash Ignite Heal etc.)
rbl7o2,hnp72gs,hnp72gs,Any tips for a new player?,Nicksiss,12/08/2021,1,try the arcane show and the ruined king game
rbl7o2,hnox86o,hnox86o,Any tips for a new player?,ApplePitou,12/08/2021,0,Jungle is in my opinion the most difficult role to start with but if you master it well you will be very useful :3  Additionally I recommend you to watch a video that explains step by step how to be a good jungler and from myself I can add that always try to gank only when there is a certain possibility of killing or making the enemy champion have to use summoner spells like flash barrier or exhaust :3
rbl7o2,hnoy35c,hnoy35c,Any tips for a new player?,WinterEvent2409,12/08/2021,0,I agree with u/ApplePitou on this that its a hard role to start with and watch basic jungle guides and since i dont know you play you should also watch guides on the champ you want to play in the jungle because every champion has its own way of gangking.  Since your new i wouldnt worry about your other teammates and just try to gank since afterall they are probably new as well and are learning too. Maybe its also a tip to /muteall if that can get to you.  Same about the end game stats you are after all the jungler PvE and the other players are laning against other players PvP so most games it would be logical for them to have more damage as they have more opportunity to do so.
rbl7o2,hnp1rku,hnp1rku,Any tips for a new player?,appllepitou,12/08/2021,0,I would recommend to jungle :3

rbkiaf,hnozign,hnozign,Level 13 Zed one-shotting Level 16 ADC without landing a single skillshot,TideRevenant,12/08/2021,2,I think he’s better now but I had this issue one time while I was playing MF. I had ghost and flash. We were same level. He ults and ignites me between ghost and flash I dodge all of his other abilities but I still died. This is all that appeared on death recount ignite and his R. At 1200 hp his R alone did 1100 damage and ignite was the rest. That was it. Had he hit me with any other ability it would have also appeared on my death recount but nah. Just those 2 sources of damage. In terms of items we both had 3 full items so it’s not like he had some major gold advantage sitting on 5-6 items. I admit I full out raged. Also for reference this was the previous season before mythic items. Either way that left a very salty taste in my mouth about zeds state of “balance.” Admittedly with this season that just now ended I haven’t quite experienced something like this again but I still have mixed feelings about him.   Unrelated note. That and PYKE executing me with his R when I’m at 75% health dafuq is that bullshit

If zed were to Land 2 Qs and one more auto he wouldve overkilled the dummy by over 1.5K damage with Rank 2 R.

If Im playing botlane and I dont want to play against a Khazix jungle I should be able to ban it regardless of my toplaner deciding to hover it or if my jungler is last pick and Khazix is highly contested in the current meta.  Learn how to play more champions play blind or dodge. Its not toxic if someone decides they dont want to play against something.  If someone is intentionally doing it? Sure thats shitty but there are multiple cases where its perfectly fine.

rbkbwz,hnpi4cr,hnpi4cr,Why are we allowed to ban a champion that our team mate hovers?,FinancialReality388,12/08/2021,3,Wellill tell you my answer. Sometimes people would pick nunu supp or viktor adc to try it out then you gonna have to ban their champ. Also it can be toxic if someone pick blitz support but you banned his support just cause you want him to play yummi.  So the reason why you can ban what someone hover is for 2 reaons. 1. You dont wanna play against yasuo since theyre going to pick him first and you playing tf mid 2. You dont want someone to pick troll champ .  Also there are people who can ban ur champ for no reasonthen you simply report them even tho we know riot wont do shit. Edit: grammar correction

Its more worth it to take the risk that the enemy will pick it and dodge if they do rather than pre-tilting your teammates.  What I dont get is people who ban a teammates hover because they have a low winrate on it or just dont like the pick. At the very least youre going to tilt them and most of the time youre going to get a pick that you like even less.

rbkbwz,hnp67t3,hnp67t3,Why are we allowed to ban a champion that our team mate hovers?,Moon_Breaker,12/08/2021,1,As a 1-trick with a name stating that I play Vi in mid lane I encounter this quite a lot.  Generally some toxic person who bans her when I hover her because Lol ur not trolling me with vi mid.  &#x200B  My typical response is to say Well if youre so confident that youll carry Ill enable you. At which point I lock in Yuumi mid.  Sometimes it works and we completely stomp because I truly am playing to enable whatever goon banned my 1-trick.  Other times they tilt off the face of the planet and flame the entire game while we lose.    Regardless of outcome I have a good time and give the game my all. Usually end up with more CS and less deaths than the person who banned my champ in the first place =\\  I do actually try to win though I dont pick it like Haha now Im useless then I pick it with the literal idea that you must be confident so Ill help you carry if youre going to ban my carry pick.  Soraka works too but doesnt feel nearly as fun.  &#x200B  &#x200B  Buuuut there are also times when I couldnt care less.  The current meta is a perfect example.  Vi is strong right now and popular right now.  If Im last pick and my team is afraid of her and for some reason wont just early pick her for me I have no problem with them banning her.  I have backup picks.  I would rather lose my champ over seeing the enemy team run wild with her.  I only care when its just some toxic person saying ur not playing that.

Yeah I understand banning legit troll picks in ranked too because I mean Jesus if you need to rely on a cheese coinflip non legit support to win like syndra or Annie then you really need to expand your pool.

Rito needs a competitive environment (e.g. ranked) to get data on the new/rework champ so they can do a balance patch.  That I understand and agree with them.  I simply do not wish to be part of that test so I ban all new/rework champ on the first 2-4 weeks.  I dont care if my teammate(s) hover it and have first pick.  I can agree with something but still wont spend money to buy it.

I pick her with the intent of If youre confident that I dont need my carry Ill make sure to help you carry.  &#x200B  I go fleet footwork/Alacrity/AS rune.  Start Dorans blade.  Build support or AP afterwards.  I encourage my teammates/jungle to take my waves any time theyre near and when the game gets to 12-15+ minutes and NARAM starts I usually grab a support item to get the extra income from it since Im not farming anymore.  Max E and just play to not die in lane getting CS when you can.  I get a surprising number of solo kills at level 6 with my ult when no one expects anything from a Yuumi.  &#x200B  But yeah - Im **not** just doing it to be useless.  Is it a bit trolly? Yes. But Im definitely playing to win and I also play Yuumi solo lane and Yuumi jungle with some friends in a 5-man team so Im pretty well versed in the actual gameplay of non-parasitic Yuumi.  &#x200B  AKA I wouldnt recommend just picking it up so much as actually practicing it for best results.

Banning someones champion just creates more problems for you. Now that player is mad that you just banned his Champ. Now start the game with a tilted player and the game hasnt even started. Now he has to play a different champ if hes not comfortable on it or he picks a troll pick because he is now mad at you. Youre just being petty and sabataging ur chances to win by not letting letting ur teamate play a champ he wants to play. If ur excuse is hes playing a troll pick banning the champ isnt going to make the person less likely to troll. Hes probably more likely because u banned his champ.

rbkbwz,hnoz9jk,hnoz9jk,Why are we allowed to ban a champion that our team mate hovers?,dannyboyheinz,12/08/2021,3,Nah. Most reasonable people get it. If I am last pick and am hovering Sett I have no issue with a teammate banning him. Hes busted and I have multiple other champs I can play. Sorry you cant play more than one champ.

Literally just this morning I had some dude pick (first time) Ivern support and my botlane went 5-25 that game. These people already made up their mind that they do not care about winning the game so yeah I dont care about their feelings when I dont let them play Syndra/Ivern support.   Im diamond by the way. :)

If youre surfing why are you so afraid of some picks lol! Get better or learn to play around those Champs or you can always dodge because enough dont know how to play around certain Champs. Who are you to ban someone elses pick. Its their pick.

rbkb9g,rbkb9g,rbkb9g,[Suggestion] How to make Silco a champion,Deltamon,12/08/2021,1,###Minor Arcane spoilers  In my opinion the best way to make Silco into a champion would be to make him not fight at all or very minimal fighting at most.  Instead his Q W and E abilities would be used to first summon a goon and then the same button would be used to move them around and attack target with single tap and use a goon specific ability by holding down the key for short time. Each goon could be moved individually and would have a long but limited range away from Silco himself who would mostly be hiding and would still be vulnerable to assassins who find him. (In similar way that Murky from heroes of the storm hides his egg)  Everytime Silco would summon a goon he would lose some of his own shimmer bar which would get replaced slowly over time (potentially get a boost from kills/assists) or by going back to fountain.  Bought items would not directly help him (other than potions) but would instead just make his goons stronger.   As for the goons (aka Q W E skills):    * You could have one tank mostly used for tower diving or for protecting other champions and whos abilities would scale with armor / magic resist. (The guy that Vi punches in prison)    * Then you would have melee assassin who procs the item passives like sheen etc and who would be best used for last hitting. (Renni with her suit from the show)   * And third goon would scale with AP and would do damage from distance. (Finn)    Then finally there would be the R ability which would summon Sevika give you the full control over her and make Silco protected (but unable to move) for the duration until Sevika either dies or gets exhausted after ~30 seconds or so. This would also change Q W and E abilities into Sevikas abilities such as boosting herself with Shimmer to heal and increase her damage (with limited uses) using the Sword slash seen in the show and possibly dashing towards her enemies. During the R being active all the other summoned goons would get summoned to her and follow Sevika to attack her target while still using their own abilities that would be tied to corresponding ability (Slash for range dash for assassin and boost for tank).  As for Silcos passive he could use shimmer to boost other ally by attacking them to heal them and increase their damage for short time.. Or just simply boost them passively by staying near them.  The goons would always be summoned from where Silco is including the R ability meaning that to get most out of the R ability he would have to get closer or waste time of it.. However due to the R also making him protected this would let him position better or save himself from turret dives but could also not be used while crowd controlled.  As for Silcos own attacks he would use very basic melee attacks that doesnt scale with items but would do basic damage in early game also this could be used to clear wards which his goons couldnt do. His health also wouldnt scale with items but would get increased from levels.. Experience gained would be based on either him or one of his goons being near dying minions.
rbkb9g,hnpfkit,hnpfkit,[Suggestion] How to make Silco a champion,C9sButthole,12/08/2021,1,Interesting concept but I will just say that pet-focused champions are inherrently a super unhealthy game design. The counterplay is really minimal and its super hard to find a healthy balance with them. If that champ is anything other than insanely underpowered theyll just suck all the fun out of the game.  Old Yorick had a very similar problem and it ultimately ended in him losing 99% of his original kit. Not because it was hard to balance but because even when it was balanced it made the entire enemy team miserable.

rbk14i,hnp6ghv,hnp6ghv,Clan tags.,Moon_Breaker,12/08/2021,0,I mean although I dont agree with your reasoning.. I would love to see them come back.  They were a fun little way to show a connection with friends and helped a lot in lobby when we would be swapping roles or something as people immediately knew we were duod and that the Yi botlane was clearly swapping with the Tristana Jungle even though no one said anything.  &#x200B  Was also a great way to keep in contact with fellow 1-tricks without needing a third party program or website.

rbk14i,hnq62q5,hnq62q5,Clan tags.,Unoriginal_Opinion,12/08/2021,1,why should i have to run a 3rd party program? Pesoanally I would just prefure to que up and get the same from the game. I know I know...a lot of gamers like their 3rd party shit.  Look I would not be apposed to to being a filler for premades 2man 3man and 4man if i got win experiance or credit for EXP to my champion and account growth regardless of wether win or loss but based on my personal performance. The problem is that premades are hell to paly with for those who claim to have only been matched with good ones good for you for your lucky RNG. ( out of 10 premades I get stuck with are horrid and THEY are the reaosn the match is horrid wether on other team or my team they are usually the reason behind all toxic.  I would not mind getting stuck with thses shits as much if i wasnt punished for their toxic throwing. If my account and champion EXP gain was based on personal performanc einstead of win/loss then I would be cool with these trolling premades.
rbk14i,hnq9ak9,hnq9ak9,Clan tags.,Soundcaster023,12/08/2021,1,>why should i have to run a 3rd party program? Pesoanally I would just prefure to que up and get the same from the game. I know I know...a lot of gamers like their 3rd party shit.  I played a lot end-game ESO. 3rd party add-ons were mandatory there so I dont see the issue. OP.GG gives so much real time statistics to alter strategies ingame. Youre missing out man.  If you dont want any premades more than 2 go play solo/duo queue. Otherwise just grow a thick skin and ignore being used as a scapegoat.
rbk14i,hnqahp2,hnqahp2,Clan tags.,Unoriginal_Opinion,12/08/2021,1,Yeah...totally awsome to ahve two 12-15 year old shit heads hold me hostage jsut for the lols. it doenst matter how hard i try or paly the group throws and i get nothign for my effort but wasted time. piss off with thick skin it is a flawed system and needs to be fixed. simply not punishing me for bad team mates or griefing team mates iw enough to fix it.  **EDIT:** You do relize as i write this response i am currently being held hostage in a match where this 4man said they are just delaying the match to make me suffer and in /all chat they are tellign other team where i am. my huge crime was daring to ask their friend the adc to help me when the other bot dove. this is why they need to fix the premade sytem DONT PUNISH SOLOS FOR THE GRIEFING OF GROUPS
rbk14i,hnqlx43,hnqlx43,Clan tags.,Soundcaster023,12/08/2021,1,Theres nothing to be fixed because there isnt a specified problem. Premade is too vague and obscure.  Why do I get the feeling that this hostage taking is nothing more than a refusal to surrender because they want to continue to play and that someone having a bad game is not a compelling enough reason? I dont surrender either because my mid goes 0/3 early. Though luck.
rbk14i,rbk14i,rbk14i,Clan tags.,Unoriginal_Opinion,12/07/2021,0,Clan tags really need to return to the game. Or some other form of identifying groups/premades. It would be nice to know what you are gettign into stuck with in champ select. It could help you pick better or just dodge.

Which is neat. I dont think Silco would particularly work as a Champion in League since he doesnt really have a lot in the way combat prowess. Now his right hand lady with the Shimmer-arm-sword-thingy.. Yeah. Bring her in.

Side note am hype for him in tft tho.

rbjvv9,hnowwvp,hnowwvp,"Could Silco be ""the support"" from the Champion Roadmap: September 2021?",moodRubicund,12/08/2021,2,No thats what they were saying it was difficult to make him in TFT specifically because they couldnt borrow from a League model because Silco is not being made for League at all. Another Rioter made a post saying they wouldnt make him a champ because they would need to change too much about him to give him distinctive shilouettes and abilities and it would detract from what made him special in Arcane.

I hope its canon because it actually feels like a well defined story rather than just a list of traits and events that the current LoL Universe site has sometimes (Shes smart and she has a nemesis who steals shit OK thank you Caitlyn backstory on the Universe site super endearing stuff Im sure).

This was just a fun theory and nothing else. It was made to get a discussion going about the new champ as well as the possibility of it being Silco.
rbjvv9,rbjvv9,rbjvv9,"Could Silco be ""the support"" from the Champion Roadmap: September 2021?",mjukarn,12/07/2021,0,Just as the title says I have a theory that Silco might be the support that riot teases a bit in the champion roadmap of september 2021. Now I know that recently a rioter talked about how it would be difficult to add him for different reasons though as some of you may have seen he is going to be added to tft which means he has both a model and animations/abilities.      The teaser in the roadmap sounds a ton like Silco he is a leader he has money and has a lot of power. All of these things are mentioned in the teaser. Im gonna put some quotes here which fits Silcos character from the teaser:  Money runs this city  -pretty obvious why this is very Silco.  Technology power people  -Silco has been working with shimmer in many different ways thus the technology part he also has a lot of power and influence thus the power and people part.  Power to turn your enemies against each other watching them kill the very ones they swore to protect.  -This could be about him using shimmer to turn his enemies against each other. If you have other ideas of what this could be let me know. And then we have the last part of the teaser  In the end they will know your name the one that truly ran this game the one calling the shots… the “support.” -The know your name part of this makes me think a lot about what Silco said to the young Powder at the end of episode 3 of Arcane We will show them all it has the same kind of vibe. And while Silco might not be in the front line using his strength skills weapon or some sort of power he is a leader and a shotcaller which fits this a lot.     Let me know what you think of this theory and please comment some more ideas for his character if you agree. Or tell me why you dont agree.

rbjsci,hnp1y34,hnp1y34,2 minutes and 28 seconds of a Jhin doing (almost)nothing right,SocialistScissors,12/08/2021,1,I mean there isnt much he can do. The only thing jhin has in his kit that works when he is behind is his W root. There is no safe farm on the map if he shows on any wave he is dead. His best course of action is honestly to just be a W root bot/ult bot.   Id be willing to bet that he is just as tilted as you are. He has a non-peel support and is against 3 assassins and a mage botlane. The enemy team comp literally screams the ADC is not allowed to have fun. He honestly should have dodged the game. There is no reason for him to play it out unless he thinks his mental is strong enough that he can play without tilting.

I think that he was mad and didnt want to do something not like he couldnt do. You won the lane as far I can see so he had no reason to be mad. Maybe got frustrated because of a play and the low elo mentality kicked in where he doesnt care anymore acting like he is a victim by having an unfair lane with a Teemo support and not looking at what enemy team has.

Felt that was worth clarifying.  I dont know if this is the right place to be looking for this but I figured this is where Id be most likely to get a good answer.  I remember this guy who used to make astonishing and really highly-edited memetages I dont remember him having very many videos at all - maybe 10 or so. I was trying to find his videos but I couldnt find anything but generic content-farm weekly montages - probably because all I could use to search for them is generic terms like jax montage lol. The only characters I remember doing were Jax made before his visual touch up where they added the range indicator to his e and Neeko made shortly after her release if I remember correctly as well as a more live commentary style video trying to get enough Dark Harvest stacks on Rengar to two-shot made somewhere around winter 2018. I also remember his outro was just his channel name made of fire and the only part of any of the videos I can distinctly remember was him figuring out one-shotting a character didnt give you a dark harvest stack in the rengar video and a couple of visual skits in the Jax video - Jax using his lantern like a helecopter propeller and flying to an icecream stand and a like minute-long emotional segment about an enemy teemo being flamed by his team. I also know he took a pretty long break months or maybe even a few years because he had just started college and his computer broke down shortly after.  Sorry for the spotty details but thats about everything I remember. It has been very long since Ive seen these videos and I was hoping to share them around to some of my friends who just started recently but I cant seem to find them. Hopefully someone can be of assistance here!

What helped was changing the refresh rate of my display. Some games have that option in their video settings League doesnt tho.  Rightclick on your desktop -> display settings -> scroll down advanced display settings.  Worth giving a try if your monitor has >60Hz refresh rate. Also check out NVIDIA Control Panel if you gave nvidia GPU. There should be refresh rate settings in Change resolution tab.

rbiabr,rbiabr,rbiabr,Jewellery merch,tokkiiiiii,12/07/2021,1,I am interested in buying the ekko bracelet or the firelight ring. I have a couple of questions for those who bought from the store. How is the fit? I have quite small hands and wrist for a woman so I am a bit scared the smallest size would be still too big (especially for the bracelet). And does anyone know when the arcane collection will be back in stock?

rbi3gf,hnov2t9,hnov2t9,"What is your ""happy to have em on your team"" champs?",LazerFruit,12/08/2021,13,Shen tops are usually gigabrained and win lane like 90% of the time  Most tank jungle players are pretty good  Midlaners either go 20/0 or 0/20 on literally every champ  Jhin brings good utility to the team and straight up murders teams when ahead  Lulu and tank players. I hate playing with mage supports and half of enchanter players never step forward and then you cant play lane. Most tank players are suicidal but its easier to play with an over aggressive support than one who doesnt want to play lanephase

Sejuani + Braum is still one of my favourite combos in the game.   Other than that: Probably Ezreal because i like to roam a lot as a Support and Ezreal usually lets me do that without me worrying about my adc dying one second after i leave the lane.

rbi3gf,hnp4pt8,hnp4pt8,"What is your ""happy to have em on your team"" champs?",HandDrawnHarriette,12/08/2021,1,Top - Sett. Big dumb hot and easy. Just a good Champ to play around in general ahead or behind.  Jungle - Zac or Warwick. Just effective at what they do and can take over the game if theyre solid players.  Mid - Talon / Anivia. Opposite sides of the Mid Lane coin that I just enjoy watching take over.  ADC - Tristana / Jhin. popoff potential with trist setups from Jhin.  Support - Thresh / Nami. Just two dominating support picks in general in my eyes.
rbi3gf,hnouumr,hnouumr,"What is your ""happy to have em on your team"" champs?",Sondeor,12/08/2021,1,If they play good any champion literally. Having a good Yasuo or Yone in your team is very good. Also having a good Katarina or Zed is also very nice.   If they suck it doesnt matter if they play Zac Sett or whatever champ you think is braindead trust me ive seen every champion feeding with more braindead people who are playing them.   BTW my good/bad ratio doesnt mean their KDA. You can be a good irelia with 0-5 kda and still help your team win that fight if you know how to play her. Also you can be a bad player with 18/10 KDA and still suck and lose the game while angrily typing you all shit fuck you all hope you get cancer type of stuff.   TLDR: I love players with brains. You can be bad as mechanically or you could have a losing lane but after the laning ends with enough iq points you could be useful to your team anyway. 1 smart CC 1 smart bait can change the whole game. I have so many games over the years where i won the game while having 1/7 kinda KDAs.   If you cant carry at least help someone else to carry. Simple as that!

rbi3gf,hnpmhfd,hnpmhfd,"What is your ""happy to have em on your team"" champs?",npri0r,12/08/2021,1,Top: any tank or tanky bruiser like ornn or Darius. They never int and even if they lose lane we have a solid comp because of a tanky top laner and solid team fights. If an ally picks a squishy top laner especially a marksman or mage they always int and we’re left with a dead comp because the rest of our team is likely squishy and we just lose. The only exception to this rule is my 1 trick irelia friend who never ints.    Jngl: tanky/high sustain junglers tend to do better especially if our top picks a squishy champ. If this happens at least we can still teamfight even if we are losing. I really like having a wwk especially in jngl.   Mid: not a marksman. Having two throws off the comp. if they don’t get a lead by being a lane bully we’re not funnelling any more resources into them over the actual adc. It’s either carry or you’re useless. I love having an Aurelion sol on the team and I will make sure to funnel everything I can into him and give him build advice.   Adc: anyone goes.   Supp: I like having an engage support because I know they’ll give a solid teamfight later in the game. I really like having a Leona because I play her I know how much cc she can dish out.

It's very overwhelming.",Flimsy04,12/07/2021,4,Title. My favourite content creators all have history with league of legends ( videogame dunkey and tyler1 ) so I end up watching it a lot and this led to me recently downloading it however I have absolutely ZERO knowledge or experience with MOBAs ( I had to google what it even stood for lmao ). I played through the tutorial and the only thing they really taught me was the controls. Who should I watch to learn? Whos a good champion to start with? wtf are lanes????? Help please.

rbhzii,hnogj7l,hnogj7l,"I have no prior experience with MOBAs and want to get into league of legends because the lore and cinematics are really cool, where do I start? It's very overwhelming.",Pretend_Yam6590,12/07/2021,1,if you have friends that already play just play with them if theyre okay with that. its going to be hell at first but youll learn very quickly.   if you dont have any friends that play then id start with watching some videos about the basics of league. the game is extremely hard to learn for a few reasons: there are a ton of champions and each champion is unique and you need to learn how to play with and against each the game has a mechanical aspect and a strategical aspect where both are important and the game has been out for a while so everyone is somewhat good already.   So dont be frustrated if you dont get the game at first. Just keep playing and trying to learn and go from there. Its a really slow process but depending on how fast you learn it can be a bit quicker.   Also once you have learned a bit about the game checking our pro play isnt the worst idea. Id suggest watching LCK (korea) games since they are slower paced and more methodical which gives you a chance to try to understand what they are doing and how the game works

It's very overwhelming.",idiot_no_6739654264,12/07/2021,1,r/summonerschool is a good place to start you can probably find answers to a lot of your questions there as for what champions to play I suggest using the blue essence you get from starter missions and leveling up to buy some of the 450 cost champs and then going into ARAM itll help you learn how to teamfight better and also youll get to try a lot of different champs that you might not have tried otherwise. Alternatively you can choose what class youd want to play (tank/bruiser/assassin/mage/marksman/support) and try some champs from that class

It's very overwhelming.",Itiari,12/07/2021,1,Definitely watch introductory to league videos. Add me at Elveron on NA servers and I’d be happy to give you tips and tricks anytime (I’ve been playing for 11 years peaked at diamond 2 a long time ago)   The most advice I can give in this reply is last hitting minions is HUUUUGE. Wave management is phase 2 which is equally as important.  Knowing and recognizing champions is the first step to learning the game and can only be done by playing the game  Have fun. Turn off chat if the toxicity gets to you (settings>interface>scroll down)

If you just play a lot eventually matchmaking will be able to match you with similarly skilled players.  \- Be quick with the mute all or mute pings. Its not about mental toughness its about the fact that youre playing a game to have fun and dont need to deal with shit from bad teammates.  \- Playing some ARAMs (all random champions one lane) will help you quickly get better at tracking things in teamfights. It may even become your preferred mode there are plenty of players that only play ARAM.  Hope you have a good time!

Example is the ruination event over summer where they would have to retcon several characters who where not where the event said they were. Some characters have been retconned multiple times.    As for gameplay other posts had very good suggestions.

There are a ton of small things that you just dont do naturally when you start like placing vision wards and knowing when its okay to be pushed in deep vs when you should be hiding under tower. Having a buddy to duo with you or watch you play and comment really helps.

It's very overwhelming.",Pretend_Yam6590,12/07/2021,1,yeah i fell for that when I started playing I really liked playing irelia and zed (not the hardest but not good for beginners). Then I forced myself to play ashe until I could play her in like plat games and then started to diversify a bit.   Dont worry about teamfights. Just try to focus on bigger things like map movements how they are manipulating their lane when they start objectives.   Also pro play is a waste of time if you dont understand the fundamentals first. So focus on that.  Frankly if you want to properly learn the game play mid lane. It requires you to do a bit of everything. Usually junglers and supports have bad mechanics and dont know how lanes work. Jungle and support is a bit more of a team-based role so its easier to pick those up once oyu learn the game. Learning how to lane is very important.

rbhw6j,hnp68el,hnp68el,Rumble success in the jungle,Bawu24,12/08/2021,1,Main reason for this is the fact that he could be flexed in 3 different roles. When a champion can be played in too many different roles at once riot nerfs one of the roles and usually it’s the jungle since you can’t really nerf a champion out of one lane without affecting the other. This also happened with pantheon at the beginning of the season when he was playable top mid and jungle. Rumble is definitely still playable there but you will most likely find more success playing him mid or top
rbhw6j,rbhw6j,rbhw6j,Rumble success in the jungle,kkimble91,12/07/2021,0,Has anyone else had more success with rumble in the jungle than top or mid?   Why isn’t he played in the jungle more often? Seems like he was made for it.
rbhw6j,hnofk9c,hnofk9c,Rumble success in the jungle,HiuretheCreator,12/07/2021,1,last time he was meta it was mainly in the jungle op as fuck too
rbhw6j,hnofzpu,hnofzpu,Rumble success in the jungle,czartaylor,12/07/2021,1,no one plays rumble at all anymore thats why. otherwise hes a fully functional jungler right now hes just also a crazy good mid laner for mostly the same reasons.
rbhw6j,hnogjk4,hnogjk4,Rumble success in the jungle,CreativeAd481,12/07/2021,1,Hes terrible in the Jungle right now and hes not super great top. Hes really really strong mid though. Just look at his winrates:  48.5% top 47% jungle 52.5% mid.
rbhw6j,hnohamd,hnohamd,Rumble success in the jungle,SoulZerker,12/07/2021,1,Im not entirely sure but one more possible reason he isnt played as much anymore is probably because of the scuttle nerfs(s12) making it so that you have to opt for a full clear before getting level 4 and from what I remember his clear got nerfed(s11) making it take longer if you want to full clear which made him a lot weaker since rumble jungle stomped games by getting lvl 4 early stacking up passive and deleting the enemy jungler in a scuttle fight with his lvl 4 combo and since he cant do that anymore something like a diana probably would be better.
rbhw6j,hnoftxr,hnoftxr,Rumble success in the jungle,kkimble91,12/07/2021,1,Yeah I noticed but that seemed to come and go pretty quickly. Did he get nerfed?
rbhw6j,hnogq0u,hnogq0u,Rumble success in the jungle,czartaylor,12/07/2021,1,his win rates are in no way representative of his strength. Among other reasons he had a 48% jungle win rate when he was pick/ban and by far the best jungler in the game.
rbhw6j,hnoi9pt,hnoi9pt,Rumble success in the jungle,HiuretheCreator,12/07/2021,1,he has 0.6 pickrate in mid tho reckon its mainly mains picking him better than top tho at least
rbhw6j,hnog1cu,hnog1cu,Rumble success in the jungle,czartaylor,12/07/2021,1,hard. riot partially reworked his whole heating system to fix rumble jungle. still works though.
rbhw6j,hnog27n,hnog27n,Rumble success in the jungle,HiuretheCreator,12/07/2021,1,he did from what i remember they gave him some minor buffs after but he still didnt recover
rbhw6j,hnohehn,hnohehn,Rumble success in the jungle,CreativeAd481,12/07/2021,1,For professional players. Being strong in professional play has nothing to do with being strong in solo queue. Being theoretically overpowered doesnt matter in these discussions because if people cant win with him he isnt a good pick for them.
rbhw6j,hnoiojf,hnoiojf,Rumble success in the jungle,CreativeAd481,12/07/2021,1,Hes a low pickrate champion in general but there isnt much evidence that low pickrate champions are played more by mains than other champions
rbhw6j,hnooqa1,hnooqa1,Rumble success in the jungle,kkimble91,12/07/2021,0,Why are they trying to keep him out of the jungle. He literally has a jungle skin. And his kit is very jungle centric.
rbhw6j,hnoiwce,hnoiwce,Rumble success in the jungle,HiuretheCreator,12/07/2021,1,i mean one thing is for sure hes better in mid than top

If you are fed it doesnt matter how many kills the enemy has you can kill them. You basically need to learn to punish mistakes while not doing them

rbhcwf,rbhcwf,rbhcwf,how to win unwinnable games ? How to use lead properly ?,musiclover1c,12/07/2021,0,My whole team is inting  all over 10 death  keep taking stupid fights . How am i supose to use my lead ? I was 15/5/9. My team keeps on fighting non stop. I split they fight . Whatever i do they keep on fighting and keep inting non stop. I dont know what i can do. My teammate is just so bad.  &#x200B  They lose their lanes  and keep on dying . I got most of the shutdown. I farm  split and take obejctive but the gold evens out because my team dies to the enemy repeatly  its so frustrating. The game was very winnable if they didnt int and die so much and this really makes me angry.
rbhcwf,hnocm28,hnocm28,how to win unwinnable games ? How to use lead properly ?,Dangercritter,12/07/2021,4,I get most of the shutdown  Thats your problem. If you take all the gold how do you expect your team to catch up? The enemy has an even split in gold and now you purposefully made it a 1v5. Help your teammates catch up by giving them a lead on kills and objectives. If youre already ahead the assists and occassional kills will keep you up there.
rbhcwf,hnogule,hnogule,how to win unwinnable games ? How to use lead properly ?,Pretend_Yam6590,12/07/2021,5,Youre not. Games are called unwinnable for a reason. Even the best players in the world will drop a game or two in lower elos.   There are certain games where you will lose no matter what you do and there are some games that you will win no matter what you do (as long as you arent completely useless). The games in the middle are the ones you should focus on. Accepting that some games are unwinnable is really important.   As for playing with shutdowns remember that what is the correct play in one elo is not going to be the correct play in another elo. So while yes maybe taking that fight was stupid but you  need to participate in that fight because its always better to do the wrong thing together than half ass the right thing. Also if you get the shutdowns you have a responsibility to carry. Dont steal shutdowns if youre on a champ that isnt designed to do that.

rbgxbx,hnolzv3,hnolzv3,"If anyone has ever wanted to see a flying vex, here it is",Helixranger,12/07/2021,6,Iirc there like a less than a second span right before you recall that you cant get it cancelled by dmg. I believe its less than 0.2 sec. Abilities that can follow dashes also get some weird interactions/bugs due to this. Cue the videos of Leona Eing the enemy to base or Warwick Q following a TPing target.

rbgsgm,rbgsgm,rbgsgm,"I honestly feel like out of all the skins in 2021, the two Elderwood skins are one of the best ones.",BulletCola,12/07/2021,19,I am not undermining the other great skins such a Space Groove Blackfrost or Arcana (One of my absolute personal favorites in general) and there are quite a bit of skins that I like but others do not (Such as Debonair or Battle Academia).  But for a year in which theres a lot of skins that are either mixed or negatively received by the community (Either for justified or otherwise different reasons) the Elderwood skins felt like they were executed meaningfully for the respective champions Gnar and Reksai.  Personally I am at the belief that you can make any of the skin concepts to be amazing as long as you have a great/good execution of that idea which seems like the Riot seems to be missing either because they feel samey with one another or they just some distinct element that made their skinline goof (Such as the Crime City Nightmare skins not having enough Mafia style to their VFX and sort of their design).  The Elderwood skins I feel like they were executed well for their idea making them distinct in some way from other skins of that line as well as feel a natural fit (Which can be done for unfitting concepts imo but thats besides the point).  Gnar being this bone critter with leaves that makes him have an overall different look? Looking like someone out of Ori?  Or Reksai being this floral burrower that blossoms the soil around her?  Those are huge hits to me.
rbgsgm,hnodlj7,hnodlj7,"I honestly feel like out of all the skins in 2021, the two Elderwood skins are one of the best ones.",After_Signature_6580,12/07/2021,7,Not all skin lines are given the same resources or attention.   Some skin lines really knocked it out of the park.   The others were hit or miss.   And thats okay. Thats the way its supposed to be.   Riot puts a lot of resources into 4-5 major quality skin lines throughout the year and the rest are filler.
rbgsgm,hnoej8a,hnoej8a,"I honestly feel like out of all the skins in 2021, the two Elderwood skins are one of the best ones.",BulletCola,12/07/2021,1,I agree to an extent.  To me they are overall pretty fine but not exactly as great as last years.  In regards of the community I imagine its more so mixed overall compared to last years.  Which is fine imo.

rbg3ck,hnoc39b,hnoc39b,ultimate spelbook where is feast?,MooseMaster3000,12/07/2021,2,I’m guessing the way they adjusted Feast to appear less last time was just to slap a (this amount less than the rest) onto its chance and didn’t readjust it for the fact they added more this time so it shows up even less than intended.
rbg0jm,hnoyemm,hnoyemm,"Archangel healing should work with basic abilities only, and be buffed",xanat9,12/08/2021,1,Ap Kogmaw is barely played and the old archangel was an option for almost any mage having it balanced around 1 or 2 people seems unfair.  Both anivia and Kassadin have normal basic abilities they wuold heal like everyone else now instead there is a huge gap in what it provides. They lowered the price just to make people buy it it will definitely get nerfed if they keep the low budget Kassadin was borderline this patch already
rbg0jm,rbg0jm,rbg0jm,"Archangel healing should work with basic abilities only, and be buffed",xanat9,12/07/2021,0,Kassadin and kogmaw are two examples of spammable ultimate abilities with huge mana costs that keep the item down this interaction is extremely different from people who usually have a long CD 100 mana ultimate.  Now lowering the cost will only make the item better on such champions and still weak for others since the healing you get from the average basic ability is pretty low.  Given that few champions can abuse the passive and its mainly with the R wouldnt it make more sense to just delete that interaction? The meaning of that passive is to give you a way to heal back or sustain extended fights where you spam your basic abilities the ultimate is hit only once in a teamfight an never to farm who would complain?
rbg0jm,hnocg61,hnocg61,"Archangel healing should work with basic abilities only, and be buffed",SocialistScissors,12/07/2021,3,So what you are saying is that THE Ap mana item should not be viable on three (it would also gut anivia) mana hungry AP champs? They already implimented a cap per cast.  If your specific issue is with kog and kassadin then the item should have its healing increased but the cap decreased. AP Kogmaw and Kassadin (and anivia) should be building archangels saying no you cant build this is a joke.

rbfq2a,rbfq2a,rbfq2a,"What do you think of a Legendary skin that visually ""Awards"" you by playing smart, or do some good things?",BulletCola,12/07/2021,0,For an example of what I meant by:  &#x200B  A Gnar Legendary skin that is mainly themed around sport-ish/Nights games (Like think of Wii Sports or Mario Golf). His Hop has him jump through a hoop after successfully hopping on a unit giving him points that would be added (Which has a High Score based on every match you do). If he hops before turning Mega Gnar he gets Ultra Bonus points along with a neat sound effect. Similar thing would happen with his Q trajectory and his mini passive.  Along with his R stun and his Mega Gnar abilities  Imagine if you hit an enemy champion not by hitting them straight but by having it go *backwards* on them (Aka taking advantage of his Qs trajectory) you would get a Nice shot voice (Sort of like the one from the Wii Sports games)  &#x200B  I can go further.  Imagine a Mundo skin where he has a Combo point system that awards him by being as much sustained as possible during an extended fight or teamfight such as from Q W grey heal Ultimate stuff like that as well as give him nice callouts when he escapes from a damaging attack from his cannister or Cleaver slow.  Or an Ekko skin that gives him a typical DMC combo system that based on the influence he directs from stuff like his W stun E auto R AOE and such as well as congratulating him based on what type of decision making he chooses when he wins a skirmish.  Like Ambush Oversight! when he bursts someone starting with W from far away or Timewinding Maniac when he does all of his burst upclose from the very start (Or rotates his entire kit including ultimate).  &#x200B  What do you think?

rbf7xp,rbf7xp,rbf7xp,i can't believe it's gonna be the third season volibear has this horrible rework,moody_P,12/07/2021,0,it feels like just yesterday I was still playing him flipping Sett abusers sideways from my team to turn their 5-man W into a 0-man W. stuffing a point blank camille dash with my E. back when thunder claws was an actual damage button and not a 10-onhit damage waveclear effect and you could dps entire teams hard if you were left unchecked. Dont even get me started on that sweet execute dropping down marksman abusers from 60 to 0 if they looked at you wrong.   and its all gone.. replaced with damage I never asked for mobility I never needed all so Volibear can be another sheen backpack with no real quality to call his own. Just a worse Warwick now really. And he takes a minor nerf when he was too strong instantly descends into the gutter and never recovers. We took out all his utility his identity and we left him like... this. A husk. A shell of a bear.  Its a real tragedy. I hope Santa brings me a revert for Christmas.

rbejgf,rbejgf,rbejgf,"If Sevika was a champ, what would she do?",PuerSimia,12/07/2021,0,She is the lady with the funny robot arm from Arcane. I think she would be a top and would work like this:  •Passive(Chemtech arm): As she attacks or uses specials she consume canisters of shimmer to boost her damage and movement speed. Keep in mind that they do run out and must be refilled. She can still use abilities but they will not be at their full strength and effectiveness. The cannister refills by themselves but is Sevika that must reload her arm.  •Q(Skewer): A close range attack that stabs the opponent with her arm that causes a bleeding effect. If she has one cannister she will trip the enemy rooting them and with both canisters of shimmer it becomes a crippling wound slowing targets down for 2 seconds and buffing her next attack.  •W(Shimmer boost): Sevika consumes one or two canisters of shimmer increasing her moviment and attack speed as well as her damage each canister consumed(20 and 40% respectively).  •E(Chemtech blade): Sevika stabs the opponent in front of her with a sword hidden in her arm and pulls the enemy closes but if the player holds the button she will pull the sword to the side slashing the enemy dealing more damage instead of pulling. If she has one cannister the pull will bleed the enemy and the slash will do more damage and both cannisters the pull also slows and the slash also cripples.  •Ult(Red blade): Sevika fires bullshit laser slashes at her opponent and slowing them briefly and dealing huge damage. If she has one cannister the slashes will stun the target instead but if she has both cannisters the slashes will also cripple the opponents

I’d change his passive to literally anything else because dying shouldn’t be part of a glass cannon’s kit(unless you’re one of those… lethality sion players) and I would probs change his e to work differently I was thinking have him be a choke point adc.

I spent max 100€ in 10 years of playing and all of it was before they made the 975 skins cost 1350.   1350rp for some pixels that I would have got for 975rp a few years ago is way too much.   That being said I have friends working call center jobs who spent more than 1000€ on league skins and they keep buying.

In the past Riot has said that skin prices went up because skin quality went up due to their design teams just getting better at they’re jobs. The justification for Riot upping the prices of skins to 1350 instead of 975 is pure profit focused.   1350 skins ARE 975 skins. Riot just raised the price because they felt like it.  If skins like Wildfire Zyra Mafia Jinx or even Special Weapon Zac were released today I guarantee they would be priced at 1350.

Them coming out with more and more expensive ones makes me less likely to purchase not more.  Maybe if Id been playing the whole time like a frog in a boiling pot I wouldnt have noticed. But Ive only really dropped in for a couple of weeks a year since about 2015 so it always strikes me as quite drastic how much the monetisation of this game has changed. First it was mystery skins then Your Shop emotes Eternals? (still dont know what tf those are) loading screen borders hextech chests and keys battle passes event passes skin bundles skin lines coming out with way higher frequency (to the point where it looks like every skin is part of a theme now)... to say nothing of TFT with its little Legends (including lootbox eggs) arena skins blasts their own battle passes and so forth.  Like I dont begrudge any game the ability to monetise least of all a free one but LoL has seriously gone from buy skins to support the game to throwing literally everything in the microtransaction kitchen sink at us yelling BUY BUY BUY. It feels insincere and greedy and the ramping up of average skin prices over time is just one very visible factor.

Passive consumers are the best for Riot as they can pretty much sell them anything they want unless its egregiously bad they arent even participating in any discussion around the game anyways.

That is a big except especially since the jump from 975 RP to 1350 RP has so far literally been the SFX. So it is technically correct to say it lacks anything that justifies the 1350 RP price tag as what justifies the 1350 RP price tag compared to a 975 RP skin is literally missing.  For me personally the SFX is just as important as the visuals when I decide on buying a skin. For some skins Id even rate the SFX higher e.g.  Eternum Noctune. Sole reason I got that skin was because of the ultimate sound.  Also very important for Prestige K/DA Evelynn tho that skin also has many other qualities the ultimate sound was what convinced me to grind for it.  Pentakill III Karthus W is the sole reason I am thinking of buying it.

I think the new Firelight Ekko skin looks really nice. Heres the spotlight:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=updzCFaSj1c  Great visual effects. However **there are no new sound effects** on his basic attacks or abilities. All 1350 RP skins currently have new SFX except for I think Full Metal Jayce. But thats a really old skin made when Riot was still figuring out what they wanted 1350 RP skins to be. And at least that skin has a voice filter which this skin does not.  Based on our current guidelines and precedents on skin prices this skin should have new SFX added (which I think Ekko mains would appreciate). Or it should simply be a 975 RP skin.  People complained that the 2017 SKT skins (of which Ekko was also a part of!) were not worth 1350 RP because they didnt have sound effects and in response **Riot added new sound effects** to all of them! So this is something that can be done. It should be done.  I know missing SFX on one skin might not seem like a big deal for you. But this is coming in the midst of a community realization that **Riot is trying to see how much value they can pull out of their systems and still charge us full price for.**  Our new battle pass sucks. Our new prestige point shop sucks. I do not think it is an acceptable precedent for Riot to set to charge full price (i.e. 1350 RP) for a skin that does not have full value. **If our 1350 RP skins do not get new SFX any more then they are also going to suck.**  This skin would have been 975 RP if released a few years ago. It should either be upgraded to be a 1350 RP skin or it should be 975 RP now. Thank you for reading.  ---  **edit:** To really see the difference in what you are losing with this skin look at Ekkos other skins for reference as to how we are being over-charged here:  - Academy = new model but **NO new VFX** and **NO new SFX** 750RP - Sandstorm = new model **new VFX** and **new SFX on recall and every ability** 975 RP - Firelight = new model **new VFX** but **NO new SFX** except on recall 1350 RP  It just doesnt make sense.

I vividly recall some data from a Rioter making claims about what percentage of skins they were releasing were at X Y and Z price points and that the majority were always intended to be 975s.  I just came back recently to play a bit of ARAM and TFT and while Im not spending any money at present and probably wont I checked out the shop... why is damn near every skin 1350+? Im scrolling through the shop right now actually and I cant find *any* skins for under 1350 except for the vault skins. I had to scroll back to the Thousand-Pierced Bear which apparently was a free skin given away 18 months ago. Blood Moon Evelynn seems to be the last one before that which is over three years old.  I might just be rambling but as someone who hasnt actively played LoL in a long time what happened to offering different skin tiers at different price points? Did people just stop buying them? I have plenty of good skins at 975 or even 750 they dont all have to have total VFX/SFX reworks.  Cos to me $10 worth of RP seemed like a fair price for a skin. Id splash out on more expensive ones occasionally for sure but for the most part I only used to buy the 975s and skip 1350s.

This is blatantly incorrect and only serves to weaken your argument (which I actually agree with.)  SKT Ekko was released in 2017. The original SKT skinline was put out in 2014.

That being said I do agree it needs some SFX (or at least some pitch changes or *something*) to put it at 1350 value.

(This seems simple enough to me but i would also understand the idea that some people like to swap here and there to match with friends) This naturally leads to needing more and more extensive skins to get them to sell and therefore higher prices to accommodate the work put in.
rbdz15,hnoebj2,hnoebj2,"Firelight Ekko Needs New SFX To Be a 1350 RP Skin (or, Don't Let Riot Reduce the Value of 1350 RP Skins But Still Charge the Same)",meowpatrol,12/07/2021,19,Riot stopped making only 1350 RP skins because the community wanted it that way. It was disappointing to have your main champion finally come up for a skin... and it was a 975 RP one. Dang.  I do not have access to Riots sales figures but I would assume people also spoke with their wallets and bought more of the 1350 RP skins. So Riot has real incentive to continue producing them.  Im happy to pay the 1350 RP price point on skins but I think its important that Riot continues their excellent quality. Skimping out on SFX does not hold up to their normally high standards.  I dont necessarily think this case of missing SFX is malicious but its hard to read into Riot. Especially because they are not just one person. They have some community managers who post to reddit but they usually dont post in threads like these so issues dont get clarified.  Its *probably* not a deliberate effort by some corporate overlord to over-charge and under-deliver. It *could* be that somebody messed up and thought the base SFX match the new VFX in a way thats good enough so they thought they dont need to come up with new SFX.  But either way this product is still lesser than its price tag would indicate and I think its most important to call out Riot on this matter. Not whether there is a toggle-able mask or not. Thats something above and beyond what 1350 RP skins normally get. Lets try to get this skin up to 1350 RP standards first.

Dang.  You realise this is how we used to see 750 RP skins? Nothing changed Riot just deleted those so that 975 would be the new disappointment tier (despite being perfectly fine skins - like I said not everything needs a SFX filter and new sparkly particles and some of them *did* even have a bit of that) and 1350 would become the new standard tier.

If you value another 3% higher profit over providing your players with the best possible content that is.

Snow Day (and to a lesser extent Winter Wonder) are just really nice skins though. Syndra bard gnar malzahar and lulu have snow/winter skins as some of their best ones. Singeds Snow Day skin used to be one of his best too until Resistance and Beekeeper came out.   Imo Snow Day was a great skin line not really focused on Christmas but just focused on winter which everyone experiences at some point. However Im not so surprised on why skins like Little Elf Jinx or Santa Braum dont sell well for the majority of players who dont partake in Christmas and even for the western audience all the Christmassy stuff like decorations in public is pretty tacky imo so I wouldnt necessarily want a skin for it either. Especially with no winter map because Riot is lazy.

If they do intend to raise the price of skins they should be transparent about it and admit it publicly. Or raise the price of RP so people can expect the same value for their in game currency.

rbdg7l,hnp2bov,hnp2bov,How does ban/report system work?,HalfEatenPotassium,12/08/2021,1,If you did nothing wrong youre not gonna get 9 reports... Holy shit. Why is it so hard to understand?  And if any scenario you get reported by all the other 9 players and you did nothing wrong the system will check and dismiss if you actually did nothing wrong.  You can be cussing a lot and saying shit it is mildly allowed in the game as long as is not directed to another player. But if you get reported by maybe 1 guy and the system picks it up its not gonna do anything.  However if all the players report you its gonna mean something is going on.  Its just so hard to believe you guys think that system is so primitive it doesnt value multiple reports in a single game.  If the system actually only cares about 1 report and nothing more people would be getting banned all the time for nonsense. Because all the people I know report other people when they lose a game. **I DID IT WHEN I WAS NEW.** People just report out of anger and saltyness.  There would be massive waves of bans. Damn I cant believe youre that much of caveman.  One time I hard inted without saying anything in one of my accounts and nothing happened. Time later on another **fresh** account I did the same thing but I typed that I was going to make them lose in all chat but no specifically. Guess what? 14-day ban on a Lv 12 account. Everybody reported me including the other team.  Why is so hard to understand the system?
rbdg7l,hnp419p,hnp419p,How does ban/report system work?,Arandui,12/08/2021,1,I also got reported several times and nothing happened until today even I had many very bad games and people cried to report me in all-chat.

Now we received a 14day ban only we read its one level before perma ban is this true?  PS: before someone says that cant be first penality: got chat ban in season 1 and after rejoining from Dota after writing gg ez which is common on Dota xD and honor level 5 last 3 seasons.
rbdg7l,hnnprmq,hnnprmq,How does ban/report system work?,zNYNz,12/07/2021,5,Yes if you run it down again and get caught by the system you will be perma-ban (and very rightfully so).  First tier punishment for game play is 14-day and then perma next.  There are 2 types of ban: game play and chat.  They are on 2 different punishment tracks.  If you get 14 days for game play that does not necessary means the next punishment for chat will be perma.  It will be based on whatever tier your chat punishment is on.  Works the other way around too.
rbdg7l,hnnw45c,hnnw45c,How does ban/report system work?,HalfEatenPotassium,12/07/2021,3,Small tip. Next time this happens to you. Just fucking go AFK close the game and go take a nap then come back 20 minutes later when the match has ended. Open the **Task Manager** and kill the game.  Do not run it down.  Do not type anything.  That is the best way to deal with this shitty system.  Alternatively you can just stay in fountain or click around tower and watch YouTube. Dont waste your mental or your time.  Get a second account and go play there when people hold you hostage.
rbdg7l,hnnq7jg,hnnq7jg,How does ban/report system work?,Arandui,12/07/2021,2,You are very close to a permaban (the 14 days ban is the ladt step). After the current ban any small negativ can trigger the permaban unless you play an unknown amount of games at least neutral. Then the game will count you as reformed and start from 0 again reguarding punishment.
rbdg7l,hnnxp3a,hnnxp3a,How does ban/report system work?,omdongi,12/07/2021,2,As long as your honor level is 2 or above you will not get permabanned. Since it means enough time has elapsed to restore your account into good standing. If you are below that its possible to get immediately permabanned.
rbdg7l,hnoht21,hnoht21,How does ban/report system work?,Pretend_Yam6590,12/07/2021,2,just gonna say that hostaging isnt bannable. When you go into a game you are agreeing to play it out completely no matter how it is going. Surrender votes are just a way out but not a requirement. Also banning champs in champ select should be bannable in my opinion but the champ select ban menu is cosmetic so idek how that works lol
rbdg7l,hnnpmo3,hnnpmo3,How does ban/report system work?,joelfpeixoto,12/07/2021,1,And yes you can get perma banned. But I think you still have a 30 day ban tier.
rbdg7l,hnnpl2r,hnnpl2r,How does ban/report system work?,joelfpeixoto,12/07/2021,-1,The more reports you get the easier it is to be banned or restricted. You probably got reported by all of them and the system just gives you the penalty if the chat logs show any bad word. Happened to me before.

rbdg7l,hnnqj9e,hnnqj9e,How does ban/report system work?,Arandui,12/07/2021,3,Dont really make a different. One report count the same as 9 reports in a game (thats why its useless to call report play X oder 9x player X).
rbdg7l,hno0rdn,hno0rdn,How does ban/report system work?,omdongi,12/07/2021,1,Youre not honor level 5 anymore. Once your ban is up youll be dropped to honor level 0 or 1 when you log back in. Thats why having honor level 2+ is significant.
rbdg7l,hnnx6pt,hnnx6pt,How does ban/report system work?,HalfEatenPotassium,12/07/2021,1,It does make a difference. 9 reports are more efficient than 3 or 4.  Thats why you never type anything in ALL Chat and motivate the enemy to report you. Ive gotten banned before and the other team will delightfully report you for that extra fun.  If you just type in your own team there is less chance of punishment.  9 reports gives a major red flag to the system since all the players agree youre ruining the match.
rbdg7l,hno204e,hno204e,How does ban/report system work?,dangerseeker69,12/07/2021,1,Ah so we have to get honor lvl 2 again and then were  save from perma ban?
rbdg7l,hnnxvvg,hnnxvvg,How does ban/report system work?,omdongi,12/07/2021,1,Nah its a binary indicator. If your logs dont have anything that contains bannable content the amount of reports will never matter. As long as you have typed language that contains bannable words one report is all you need to be banned. The number of additional reports have no effect.
rbdg7l,hno9yb1,hno9yb1,How does ban/report system work?,omdongi,12/07/2021,1,Basically yes. It takes a few months at least to restore it.

rbd67q,hnp030v,hnp030v,Phreak Patch 11.24 Rundown,SilenceOfRage,12/08/2021,50,Dude the whole part about Vis E at the beginning of the video is super interesting.  I dont wanna fuck up on explaining what Phreak explained but basically Riot August had the idea to give a quicker wind-up to Vi auto-attack (basically it come out faster) when she use her E so it feel good to use the spell .  But there was an issue with this. Phreak use in his example the fact Vi has 1.000 attack speed which mean every second you should do an auto attack right? Punch (1 sec) -> Punch (2 sec) -> Punch (3 sec)  But with E what would happen is this: Punch (1 sec) -> E (1.5 sec) -> Punch (3 sec)  Because even if E had a faster wind-up (faster starting animation) it is still an auto-attack and therefore even if the animation is faster the following attack still will come at the set-time it should come if E was a normal attack.  The delay felt bad so the following patch August had to add a hack that give a hidden attack speed buff after E so the next auto-attack dont feel sluggish/slow.

rbd67q,hnp9psk,hnp9psk,Phreak Patch 11.24 Rundown,FieryRedButthole,12/08/2021,8,I believe rengar has something like this on his q where his next auto after the q is slightly faster. I think it’s coded as he gets attack speed for his next two attacks after pressing q so it goes press q -> fast q auto -> fast normal auto -> back to normal auto speed.
rbd67q,hnptmur,hnptmur,Phreak Patch 11.24 Rundown,PsychologicalIron5,12/08/2021,-1,Just an aside: /u/RiotPhreak  I think your math on AP items (especially Shadowflame) in the last video was misleading.      Specifically: You say that reducing someones MR from 1 to 0 is more valuable than reducing it from 10 to 9. And while it does have a greater effect on the displayed number it doesnt change the fact that every point of MR has the same value in effective health. Am I wrong in thinking this?
rbd67q,hnoyynx,hnoyynx,Phreak Patch 11.24 Rundown,TheBestCCIsDeath,12/08/2021,-3,Phreak defended the garbage balancing of mage items before pre-season he is far from a reliable source of knowledge when it comes to AP item balance.

rbd67q,hnpxwn4,hnpxwn4,Phreak Patch 11.24 Rundown,CohnDev,12/08/2021,3,Balancing the game is about using data and analysis both of which Phreak excels at. Literally Phreak alone could balance the game better than the pathetic conglomerate that is the balance team and youd realize that if your smooth brain commanded your thick wrist to click the link and watch the video.

rbd67q,hnq41ic,hnq41ic,Phreak Patch 11.24 Rundown,asd316X,12/08/2021,3,you are wrong see: https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Magic\_resistance
rbd67q,hnqdnxs,hnqdnxs,Phreak Patch 11.24 Rundown,iUP7,12/08/2021,1,You are wrong and lets do some calculations to see why. Armor and MR (a/mr) are calculated in a way that it is still effective in low numbers (so you can buy a cloth armor in lane without completely altering your build) but you cant possibly become literally immortal. If you follow the formula x/x+100 you will see that more a/mr you buy less and less effective it becomes. For example if you had 0 base a/mr and bought 100 you would reduce the damage by half but buying an extra 100 a/mr (the exact same amount as before) would net you another 16% damage reduction (2/3 in total). So technically buying a cloth armor would be more effective than say going full tank. Same a/mr values will net different results.  Now do the experiment again but in reverse. Lets say you have 100 pen and your opponent has 200 a/mr. Instead of dealing 1/3 of your damage you will deal half of your damage. May not sound like a bad deal but for a colossal amount of 100 pen you are only incrasing your damage by about 55%. But if they had 100 a/mr to start with and you penetrated all of it your damage wouldve doubled. Same pen will net different results.
rbd67q,hnoyw5t,hnoyw5t,Phreak Patch 11.24 Rundown,TheBestCCIsDeath,12/08/2021,-2,I mean we know that Phreaks take on mage items balance before pre-season was absolute garbage so it doesnt surprise me that he has a bad take on mana too.
rbd67q,hnp6bw1,hnp6bw1,Phreak Patch 11.24 Rundown,ruffydm1,12/08/2021,10,I never specifically mentioned Crown beating out Ludens since it actually didnt have better clear than it phreak already details this in his video too. I ln regards to Everfrost Crown was DEFINITELY going to you better clear time on last patch due to how 20-30 AP gives you more total damage to jungle monsters over a full clear compared to using EF active 2 times for 200 or so total damage.  If you take a champion like Diana that gets massively affected by AP gains due to how moonsilver blade scales with monstera or Evelynn with her huge Q ratio the margin gets even wider. If you then take THE ITEM in my example which is harvester Crown was ALWAYS beating it out in terms of claer Speed and still does after a certain poise threshold. I dont think there is any real conclusive data at all my bigger point was towards how strong and yet weird the poise tag is for a jungler in ways it feels like it shouldnt be.
rbd67q,hnovmgj,hnovmgj,Phreak Patch 11.24 Rundown,qwert4the1,12/08/2021,0,Ludens should beat out Crown with its passive spell procs on camps but Crown should always beat out Everfrost in jungle clearing unless youre for some reason using everfrost active on camps.   They both have the same base AP but Crown has extra AP while safeguarded which you should always have while clearing jungle monsters unless youve skirmished recently.
rbd67q,hnqdo6b,hnqdo6b,Phreak Patch 11.24 Rundown,UNOvven,12/08/2021,1,Phreak does not excel at using data and analysis. Actually he is rather poor at it what with his reliance on using win rate to try and make sense of the balance changes even if that leads to him claiming that Heimerdinger was stronger than every other top laner. At a time where Heimerdinger was barely viable. He has access to data but he completely misinterprets it due to his lack of statistical education. He would be *even worse* at balancing than the current balance team.
rbd67q,hnq2kjd,hnq2kjd,Phreak Patch 11.24 Rundown,HeyWhatsHappeninHere,12/08/2021,-4,Why would anyone place any value in the opinions of someone who twists data to conform to the findings of the balance team? Just for you I opened the video and went to the Camille section.  Camilles outside W is the single most important part of her kit.  Yeah no. I immediately closed the video right after hearing this. What a joke lmao.

rbd67q,hnpj6d8,hnpj6d8,Phreak Patch 11.24 Rundown,yehiko,12/08/2021,7,high ap scalings = AP is better  high base stats/low scaling = pen is better  this is why champs like elise nidalee etc go Penetration from the get go. they even go rocketbelt for the mythic passive. there was even a time where karthus would rush 2 (yes two) magic pen boots.

rbd67q,hnqiyf3,hnqiyf3,Phreak Patch 11.24 Rundown,CohnDev,12/08/2021,1,Not even going to bother dissecting how youre wrong its just obvious youre unfamiliar with his content so talking about it with you is a waste of time.
rbd67q,hnq6y1w,hnq6y1w,Phreak Patch 11.24 Rundown,CohnDev,12/08/2021,3,Her outside W slows by 80%... which means it guarantees she can hit E which guarantees she can hit both parts of Q. It alone enables her entire kit. Like the fact that you cant see how A means B and B means C is just embarrassing. The only joke here is you and your single-digit IQ.
rbd67q,hnql9cm,hnql9cm,Phreak Patch 11.24 Rundown,Entchenkrawatte,12/08/2021,1,You are correct that 10 Armor gives 10% Original HP as ehp. But consider this: 10 Armor to 0 makes U Go 110->100 which is a decrease of 1/11 of ur current ehp.  110 Armor to 100 makes U Go 210->200 which yields a 1/21 decrease in current HP.  Therefore the actual damage U do is increased more by flat pen when resistances are Low.
rbd67q,hnouikm,hnouikm,Phreak Patch 11.24 Rundown,6000j,12/08/2021,8,dont forget the 6-9% scaling from her passive either it adds up a bunch.  Q does pretty absurd AP scaling when you add it all together if you get minimum damage it averages out to around 99% AP scaling if you were to only cast it.
rbd67q,hnozfk8,hnozfk8,Phreak Patch 11.24 Rundown,qwert4the1,12/08/2021,2,I suppose you can make that argument and it is valid in scenarios where the jungler for sure knows they wont get into a skirmish in the nearby future. I think it really complicates the math though because even with ingenious hunter the active will be around 25-20 seconds depending on stacks (and slightly lower with cosmic insight) so its a pretty big trade off for good junglers to use whereas the extra AP from Crown is essentially a non decision boost similar to luden procs.   Overall though I dont think its too important in either scenario because most junglers will have the mythic completed at around level 9 where Crown of the Shattered Queen is giving 24 AP advantage which should roughly equate to the active damage boost of Everfrost if being used on cooldown for most AP junglers because of AP ratios and would obviously beat out on Everfrost if you consider that you might want to hold the active since you wont know if youll need to use it in the next 25-20* seconds.
rbd67q,hnq8ebi,hnq8ebi,Phreak Patch 11.24 Rundown,HeyWhatsHappeninHere,12/08/2021,1,I will impart some knowledge on you: you can guarantee an E hit by literally just standing next to a wall when you first cast it. Camilles strength is in her ability to engage on you from 2 screens away and then nuke you for a third of your HP. Her W is piss nothing.
rbd67q,hnqbxgb,hnqbxgb,Phreak Patch 11.24 Rundown,CohnDev,12/08/2021,1,Right... but if youre standing but a wall your next move is extremely telegraphed and if the other player isnt horrible and knows her E range its never hitting. Youre looking at this from such a one-dimensional view - unlike Phreak who isnt scared of doing some critical thinking.
rbd67q,hnqsw1w,hnqsw1w,Phreak Patch 11.24 Rundown,UNOvven,12/08/2021,1,Im not though. Thats the sad part. [Here](https://youtu.be/DpyQhoMX8BI?t=1140) is the relevant part. He claims that Heimerdinger is OP. Because his win rate is high and Phreak doesnt understand has literally ***NOTHING*** to do with power. Even though if you had actually been around back then you wouldve known that Heimerdinger was not just not OP but considered on the *weaker* side a champ you only used for counterpicks (which is one of the 10 dozen reasons win rate is useless). Phreak misses this part of course.

rbd67q,hnnt2tu,hnnt2tu,Phreak Patch 11.24 Rundown,ruffydm1,12/07/2021,-5,I agree with phreaks thoughts on Crowns Poise where you would expect a defensive item to not also field combat stats on par with its offensive peers.   On a side note has there been any data standing out regarding Crown on AP junglers in regards to monsters farmed/clear time? To me it felt weird that Crown gave you the same/better jungle clear than buying an offensively geared jungle item like dark harvester would due to the raw AP gained It does hit the AP breakpoint to beat out harvester/EF later on with current patch i suppose.
rbd67q,hno9fsb,hno9fsb,Phreak Patch 11.24 Rundown,No_Ring_3342,12/07/2021,-49,It amazes me how much these LoL casters can talk without saying anything.
rbd67q,hnnzpnm,hnnzpnm,Phreak Patch 11.24 Rundown,Atheist-Gods,12/07/2021,27,The thing is that it depends on the champion and also what stage of the game. For Seraphine AP is massively important especially on your first 2-3 items.
rbd67q,hnok05w,hnok05w,Phreak Patch 11.24 Rundown,daswef2,12/07/2021,13,AP loss also has a bit of an impact on waveclear across all users.  Similarly I think Phreak underestimates mana as a purchase when discussing here because mana isnt just mana it is also tempo and waveclear and more time out on the map for a lot of class users who tend not to be tempo setters.  Theres certainly some champs who dont need that level of mana but theres also a good chunk of champs who dont have to as heavily weigh every spell cast in skirmishes whether youll run out of mana before an objective in 45 seconds you can just cast that spell because you have the mana for it.    I really like hearing Phreaks perspective though and these are always extremely cool its one of my favorite things about patch day to see the notification for Phreaks rundown.

rbd67q,hno6knl,hno6knl,Phreak Patch 11.24 Rundown,Atheist-Gods,12/07/2021,27,Both  Echo Q has a 130-195% AP ratio depending on opponents HP%   Echo W has a 60% AP ratio shield (buffed to 90% on yourself) and up to 5.625%% AP ratio missing HP healing which results in 56% AP ratio on targets with 1000 missing HP  These both have large AoEs and 20 AP can result in over 100 outgoing damage or shielding+healing 100 damage on a single spellcast with these abilities. Her base numbers are very low to balance this. Seraphine is the most AP dependent mid and the most AP dependent support.

Was the strongest Kayle had ever been in league history with on-hit fervor of battle and 2 item nashor rageblade spike procced every 2nd hit instead of every 3rd hit youd output like 6000 aoe damage counting resists during your 3sec ult at level 16-18. Could legitimately 1v5 and melt teams during your ult duration. I miss it.  But they nerfed rageblade to every 3rd hit in mid season 9 because of Vayne and Yi abusing the item too hard. Oh well. The item still gave 73% AS and 25 AD/AP 15% dual pen and magic damage on-hit still a great hybrid item for Kayle and Kaisa. And then they deleted all of its stats in s11 & kept the same price lmao.

rbd2gm,hnotonu,hnotonu,Kai’sa really needs some love,HalfEatenPotassium,12/08/2021,1,Right Galeforce Jhin the least hated ADC... Okayyyy...  Jhin is listed as Marksman Catcher Mage more accurately. It does not say **assassin ANYWHERE.**  And if you think Jhin is an assassin so is Draven and Varus... And following that logic Gnar and Jayce are AD Carries.
rbd2gm,hnosclp,hnosclp,Kai’sa really needs some love,HalfEatenPotassium,12/08/2021,-1,Lol. Bitch please.  I play GP you dont see me crying about 47% winrate champ because I dont struggle to hit the 60% winrate mark.  Meanwhile this kid is crying that he cant R + one-shot somebody. KaiSa players are just garbage. Same with Irelia. If they cant outplay with their intense right-click mechanics they have to whine all across the internet for buffs.  You must be new to the game because you dont seem to remember how disgusting is KaiSa when shes meta. Literal pick or ban braindead ADC that assassinates even tanks.  Go back to iron please. Where nobody can play ADC decently and needs buffs.
rbd2gm,hnp8foe,hnp8foe,Kai’sa really needs some love,TTVBasedJafar,12/08/2021,1,So people who got to high elo on a champion that was incredibly broken for a long time who are upset they cant cheese with that champion and have to play the game with some diligence?  aight
rbd2gm,hnpfhla,hnpfhla,Kai’sa really needs some love,brokerZIP,12/08/2021,7,Agree. Buff her AP scalings so she can allow zhonyas and all 3 evolves.
rbd2gm,hnpyf1q,hnpyf1q,Kai’sa really needs some love,WhereAreDosDroidekas,12/08/2021,2,In a burst or be bursted meta its not fun being forced to hold the bag and not fit defensive items into your build.
rbd2gm,hnq656v,hnq656v,Kai’sa really needs some love,frenkli_h,12/08/2021,0,oh sorry i forgot when she was strong during msi too
rbd2gm,hnp2x5h,hnp2x5h,Kai’sa really needs some love,ConscienceNot,12/08/2021,0,They didnt do such marketing as in case of release of seraphine and they also made her actual champion and not  just copy of older one. So its arguable.
rbd2gm,hnow39n,hnow39n,Kai’sa really needs some love,InvitemetoSkeet,12/08/2021,6,ADC killing a tank is the job of the adc.  I dont even play Kaisa because I think the champ is been terrible considering you need an aftershock support and the support playerbase has an iq of 13 so they will never do that.  Kaisa is just a bad champ I really dont understand how you lose to it. 525 range and she legit dashes into ur team its a joke.
rbd2gm,hnosxmm,hnosxmm,Kai’sa really needs some love,HalfEatenPotassium,12/08/2021,-2,I dont get whats the OTP argument. Everybody plays these characters and theyre all the same from casuals to OTPs. You think theyre hard or something?  Akshan E forward 10 AAs per second or KaiSa W + R + Q one shot?  Which one is the hard combo?
rbd2gm,hnp5h6i,hnp5h6i,Kai’sa really needs some love,Empty_ManaPotion,12/08/2021,-1,pretending those champs are hard and only otp are succesful with them? you can literally run down anyone on akshan with aa+e+ignite
rbd2gm,hnpd3vn,hnpd3vn,Kai’sa really needs some love,13raxtoe37,12/08/2021,1,Picking a supp without setup for kaisa is so grief i cant belief it. Recently laned as kog lulu vs braum kaisa they couldnt play the game. But some ppl just ego their picks and dont adapt. To add on that i hate playing with kaisa myself even tho i play champs she should synergize well (thresh naut rakan) cuz she isnt strong on one hand on the other the adcs i see cant play her (play her myself from time to time)
rbd2gm,hnpghgl,hnpghgl,Kai’sa really needs some love,frenkli_h,12/08/2021,1,ok so u did lose to kaisa and akshan otp good to know
rbd2gm,rbd2gm,rbd2gm,Kai’sa really needs some love,vaalei,12/07/2021,34,Right now Kai’sa has a winrate in high elo of 47.65% according to [u.gg](https://u.gg/lol/champions/kaisa/build).   Because of her being an assassin adc you need to have burst damage which she lacks in the early game. If you would for example build crit to be able to get your evolves quickly you would deal enough damage until ~30-35min into the game. Unless you are really ahead.  On the other hand if you were to build lethality on her. Along the lines of how Sivir builds. You wouldn’t be able to get the e evolve quickly and it would take a lot of time to fully stack your passive in order to kill them.   Most of us Kai’sa mains were hoping for some love to her for this preseason. She is in a really weird place during this meta and I wish she could get some changes in order to rival at least some of the other adcs.
rbd2gm,hnnrva9,hnnrva9,Kai’sa really needs some love,yrueurbr,12/07/2021,63,Her lategame is subpar for his weak laning  I think vayne is just a stronger kaisa right now

rbd2gm,hnoixra,hnoixra,Kai’sa really needs some love,daswef2,12/07/2021,11,Really hoping they buff her more AP focused builds personally I find playing her as a crit marksman to just be really boring I liked the hybrid or AP heavy version of her much more.  Adjustments to untie her from Hail of Blades would probably be good too.
rbd2gm,hnokc21,hnokc21,Kai’sa really needs some love,LezBeHonestHere_,12/07/2021,11,Revert rageblade into a real item (s10 version) and then shes fine.

rbd2gm,hnny1h5,hnny1h5,Kai’sa really needs some love,HalfEatenPotassium,12/07/2021,-26,No thanks. Dont bring that abomination of a champion back into the meta. We already have enough with Akshan killing you with 3 autoattacks.  **Assassin ADC** are 2 things that shouldnt be combined.
rbd2gm,hnnq4as,hnnq4as,Kai’sa really needs some love,TTVBasedJafar,12/07/2021,-28,Posts like this cant come from anyone in an elo worth caring about
rbd2gm,hnnzml7,hnnzml7,Kai’sa really needs some love,lovo17,12/07/2021,43,I think the item rework really warped Kaisas identity lol.  She used to be a reliable hypercarry who you can pick as a magic damage dealer in the late game. Shes now a midgame champ that spikes on two items and cant be picked in all ad comps anymore.
rbd2gm,hnnummn,hnnummn,Kai’sa really needs some love,KanoDoMario,12/07/2021,7,I dont like the Riot just creates weeb cash grab champions and makes them busted! thing because if that was the case Gwen would be an actual champion and not a melee minion

rbd2gm,hnokxsu,hnokxsu,Kai’sa really needs some love,InvitemetoSkeet,12/07/2021,4,Imagine losing to <550 range neg winrate adcs this fucking often.  Do you not realize how embarrassing this is? You are legit admitting you are shit at the game.
rbd2gm,hnnsrch,hnnsrch,Kai’sa really needs some love,Ophelia_Of_The_Abyss,12/07/2021,22,What? Multiple high elo players have talked about how Kaisa is in a terrible spot right now.
rbd2gm,hno8yan,hno8yan,Kai’sa really needs some love,TechnalityPulse,12/07/2021,23,Imagine balancing a champion around specific item spike timings with evolve mechanic and then changing the items.  KaiSa was always going to be a nightmare shes too reliant on the item spikes to be effective in lane and is forced to go kraken because she cant go shieldbow and get her 2-evolve spike but going kraken late-game is basically trolling in a meta where everyone 2 shots you without shieldbow and theres not enough tanks to justify kraken.
rbd2gm,hnopy6p,hnopy6p,Kai’sa really needs some love,GoldenButteryToast,12/07/2021,5,She was actually quite good with the new items at the season 11 and that preseason.  She is so popular that when shes even viable or good she has insanely high P/B% which causes more people to complain and her to get nerfed harder imo
rbd2gm,hnogqx2,hnogqx2,Kai’sa really needs some love,LittleDeathJr,12/07/2021,-14,she never was a hypercarry   rageblade was bullshit and made kaisa broken as hell
rbd2gm,hnoq008,hnoq008,Kai’sa really needs some love,GoldenButteryToast,12/07/2021,2,Doesnt stop people playing her with the new skin lol
rbd2gm,hnnxqfe,hnnxqfe,Kai’sa really needs some love,HalfEatenPotassium,12/07/2021,-18,Gwen was meant to be a cashgrab of the Ruined King event.  Viego feels out of place.  But holy shit they did force Gwen in that Story Arc. Champ makes no sense in League or the event at all.  However she flopped like Seraphine so Riot has been dialing her back.
rbd2gm,hnogio1,hnogio1,Kai’sa really needs some love,HalfEatenPotassium,12/07/2021,-11,Not really. The fact that theyre broken champions doesnt make the other players good so its not impossible to win against them.  But from time to time you get a dose of how stupid this champions are if you dont play super careful how ridiculous their kit is and how this characters should be in the dumpster for eternity and beyond.  However is not uncommon to see that 20/5 Kaisa/Akshan thats been one-shotting people the entire time **throw the game because they think theyre Rambo.**
rbd2gm,hnnuimv,hnnuimv,Kai’sa really needs some love,KanoDoMario,12/07/2021,25,Yeah but that gets in the way of random elo shaming
rbd2gm,hnnxhm5,hnnxhm5,Kai’sa really needs some love,HalfEatenPotassium,12/07/2021,-15,A lot of them also say Irelia is hard to play and has low winrate.
rbd2gm,hnoq1oc,hnoq1oc,Kai’sa really needs some love,lovo17,12/07/2021,3,She was good yes but she was different than she was in the past.
rbd2gm,hnojnku,hnojnku,Kai’sa really needs some love,sebnanchaster,12/07/2021,9,well yes the balance team decided to push her as a burst champ but shes supposed to be a hypercarry according to the design team meaning shes supposed to be a weak-early strong-late carry
rbd2gm,hnognac,hnognac,Kai’sa really needs some love,gaom9706,12/07/2021,5,Just say you lost to a Kaisa and Akshan otp and you can save your dignity

Let me learn how to crawl first ffs.
rbcysz,hnp4f4a,hnp4f4a,Why does pre-season draft matchmaking suck so bad?,bischof11,12/08/2021,1,If you want to play agianst people equal your skill go ranked?
rbcysz,hnqh3ap,hnqh3ap,Why does pre-season draft matchmaking suck so bad?,KhadaJhIn12,12/08/2021,1,Rewatch the game. Why did you get stomped? What are the diamond players doing in regards to wave management jungle pathing or map rotations. Diamond player arent diamond just cause they can press their characters abilities faster than you. these are literally the absolute best matches to learn from. Its easier to notice mistakes you made that they punished really hard as well as thee things you might of done well that threw them for a loop. The bigger the gap the more there is to learn when reviewing the game. you should never expect to learn anything about the game except for champion mechanics WHILE playing a match. 99% of true improvement in League comes from how you spend your time outside the match.
rbcysz,hnp6g8b,hnp6g8b,Why does pre-season draft matchmaking suck so bad?,firatedr,12/08/2021,1, But then you’ve got the toxic players of ranked I rarely play ranked normally anyways
rbcysz,hnpy0v6,hnpy0v6,Why does pre-season draft matchmaking suck so bad?,MrSchoky,12/08/2021,1,It‘s still your best option to learn the most about the game as you don‘t get stomped nor stomp others yourself and can therefor improve better. Just disable chat and try to work with only pings and if someone spampings useless stuff like someone not walking out of base 10 seconds into the game mute their pings as well as they wont contribute much to the communication anyway because they mostlikely get tilted by a fly sitting next to them and doing nothing.
rbcysz,rbcysz,rbcysz,Why does pre-season draft matchmaking suck so bad?,firatedr,12/07/2021,1, Im just a gold player but I keep going against diamonds/masters/grandmasters I mean its draft so its kind of ok I guess but I only play draft and it really isnt very fun to play against these players.
rbcysz,hnnnxjy,hnnnxjy,Why does pre-season draft matchmaking suck so bad?,Urpog,12/07/2021,5,Because pre-season ranked sucks and no one wants to play it so all the masters diamonds anyone who would normally play ranked goes to normal instead to try and attempt to have fun.
rbcysz,hnnp2nz,hnnp2nz,Why does pre-season draft matchmaking suck so bad?,Hairy_Squash_3110,12/07/2021,0,^ this is the correct answer. I will add only one thing that rather than whining about matchmaking it is better to analyze the games against these players and endure yourself a lot of useful things. Games against strong opponents are the best way to upgrade yourself
rbcysz,hnnvio2,hnnvio2,Why does pre-season draft matchmaking suck so bad?,firatedr,12/07/2021,2,yeah but its still a huge skill gap maybe if I played against high plat low diamonds I could actually learn something but this way both my team and I get stomped so theres really no room for learning

They can easily capitalize on Arcane’s success by making Ekko an expensive skin (this whole event gave us capsules TFT eggs/arena Valorant sprays etc) to make up for the plethora of free stuff they gave us I’d honestly have bought the Ekko skin on the spot if it meant as payback for the amazing series Arcane was…  …but this is severely underwhelming.

I was REALLY hoping for a firelight skin but this just isnt it sadly. Just my opinion tho.
rbcf91,hnopue8,hnopue8,"12/7 PBE Update: Firelight Ekko, Elderwood Gnar & Rek'Sai, Chromas & More",crossbonecarrot2,12/07/2021,12,Seems Firelight Ekko is Akali All Out all over again for me.  No toggle and no homeguard.  I dont see how they had all this time to think about it plan it out and make it and they decided not to.
rbcf91,hnojr1w,hnojr1w,"12/7 PBE Update: Firelight Ekko, Elderwood Gnar & Rek'Sai, Chromas & More",Tdumb,12/07/2021,21,Honestly was the ekko skin just a rush job based on fan reaction to arcane? It looks alright but it’s missing the mark in so many ways. No hoverboard no sfx the mask is barely referenced. As an Ekko main I wish they would’ve just not done it if i knew this was the end product. It looked 10x better in my head.
rbcf91,hnnsg15,hnnsg15,"12/7 PBE Update: Firelight Ekko, Elderwood Gnar & Rek'Sai, Chromas & More",ElaborateRuseman,12/07/2021,4,No mask toggle disappointing but not surprising. They wont add because Riot cant be bothered to please the vocal minority even though the model with the mask is already there in the recall.  I still like his maskless design but I just really like the mask.

Was at least hoping for some kind of in game teaser for the adc. Honestly Ekkos skin doesnt look as good to me since you cant keep the mask permanently on but maybe I am not the target audience for it.
rbcf91,hno7sys,hno7sys,"12/7 PBE Update: Firelight Ekko, Elderwood Gnar & Rek'Sai, Chromas & More",Cissoid7,12/07/2021,-2,Everyone acting so surprised about the effort that went into Ekko as if the fact that Yorick couldnt get a hat toggle doesnt tell you everything you need to know about their skin philosophy. If you aint a big money maker you aint getting much.

rbcf91,hnntdx8,hnntdx8,"12/7 PBE Update: Firelight Ekko, Elderwood Gnar & Rek'Sai, Chromas & More",Hyrdal,12/07/2021,17,Also  > New SFX!  Maybe I have no ear but every sound except the recall is the same as the [base skin](https://youtu.be/D9mxSDGabzw?t=72).  This is 975 RP quality it is on par with the other (better) anniversary skins. They even say its celebrating RiotX Arcane.  It really desserved more love I was looking forward to that release and really hyped. I wanted to zoom around the rift on my board and put on that super iconic mask. But I guess not vehicles are legendary privileges (looking at Mundo and Vayne). And Riot deemed Firelight Ekko wouldnt desserve that super Arcane VA. It was literally meant to be a legendary skin!!  Truly puts in perspective the success of Arcane... But dont worry well totally have a 5th VA for that next Lux skin!!
rbcf91,hnnym4e,hnnym4e,"12/7 PBE Update: Firelight Ekko, Elderwood Gnar & Rek'Sai, Chromas & More",BulletCola,12/07/2021,25,Probably in terms of looks.  Everything else is VERY different from Blackfrost but I understand skins are usually around models.
rbcf91,hno9i4x,hno9i4x,"12/7 PBE Update: Firelight Ekko, Elderwood Gnar & Rek'Sai, Chromas & More",ghostbyghosts,12/07/2021,41,Ekko seems like a pretty big money maker to me. Hes no Yasuo but hes definitely up there waaay past Yorick. Way past the majority of champions Id bet. Him being one of the more beloved characters from Arcane is also a huge boost.  I remember seeing him on a ton of promotional material/advertising for League before Senna took his spot. Ekko has been one of the faces of the game.  So I just dont understand why they didnt make the more noticeable features for his character in Arcane a bigger part of this skin.   - The mask is iconic but such a minor part of his skin that you only see in the recall. [Theres a screenshot going around of a Rioter reacting to people asking about a potential toggle for the mask](https://imgur.com/k07kQRz) and it doesnt seem to be positive.  - The hoverboard is iconic but you only ever see it in the recall. People wanted to actually move around with the hoverboard not stand still in place watching Ekko do tricks on it as they recall.  Its just such wasted potential for a skin. Like I wonder what stands out about Ekkos character [at 0:06 in this video here](https://youtu.be/XCg_H07_VXY?t=6) that differs from League that people are actually excited about. Lets make sure to make them the least noticeable part of the skin right?
rbcf91,hnopofx,hnopofx,"12/7 PBE Update: Firelight Ekko, Elderwood Gnar & Rek'Sai, Chromas & More",crossbonecarrot2,12/07/2021,16,Jinx braum and poppy all have vehicle homeguards.  That divine sword skin line ride their swords.  The original battle academia had props.  Akali TD has he do a full on flip.  SG skins fly.  They have no reason not to do a homeguard other than we didnt want to.
rbcez5,hnov5by,hnov5by,"If a Company Makes a Change that Benefits Them But Not the Consumer, Does that Make the Change ""Bad""?",Pure_Void,12/08/2021,1,yea but when u dont satisfy consumers then u lose money like u cant say that a  companies goal is to only make them happy by getting them rich when if they make constant changes that fuck over consumers then they will begin to lose alot of money
rbcez5,rbcez5,rbcez5,"If a Company Makes a Change that Benefits Them But Not the Consumer, Does that Make the Change ""Bad""?",jayjaybird0,12/07/2021,0,I think this is a question worth exploring with the recent announcements of Event Pass changes and the Last Chance Prestige Shop. Yes everything will be worse for the players. The math demonstrates this well enough and Im not claiming it doesnt.  Is there something inherently ***wrong*** with a business making a change that benefits them even though it means things are made worse for the consumer?  Consider this: A fast food restaurant allows customers to order water at no charge. There are instances of customers ordering multiple cups of water in varying sizes and nothing else. Restaurant enacts new policy: Customers are allowed ***one*** free *small* water *with purchase*.  Is there something wrong with that?  Obviously it means the customers are worse off than they were before but is that business decision  truly objectionable?
rbcez5,hnnl1lp,hnnl1lp,"If a Company Makes a Change that Benefits Them But Not the Consumer, Does that Make the Change ""Bad""?",Odd_Play_5769,12/07/2021,1,Theres nothing wrong if the change is to counteract an abuse the customer(s) discover that cost the business money.
rbcez5,hnniwb4,hnniwb4,"If a Company Makes a Change that Benefits Them But Not the Consumer, Does that Make the Change ""Bad""?",Cyanide-ky,12/07/2021,1,What’s changing?
rbcez5,hnogg7s,hnogg7s,"If a Company Makes a Change that Benefits Them But Not the Consumer, Does that Make the Change ""Bad""?",czartaylor,12/07/2021,1,a companys job above all else is to make the owners/shareholders money. Nothing else is even on the same level. Its literally their mandate for existing.  Companies only do things for the consumer to make the company money just not necessarily in a direct way (ie supporting political causes). Nothing a company does benefits consumers more than itself.
rbcez5,hnnldyv,hnnldyv,"If a Company Makes a Change that Benefits Them But Not the Consumer, Does that Make the Change ""Bad""?",Odd_Play_5769,12/07/2021,1,So in this instance with the pass changes it is bad business because we lose features we used to have with previous pass implementations for seemingly no other reason than company greed.
rbcez5,hnnztpy,hnnztpy,"If a Company Makes a Change that Benefits Them But Not the Consumer, Does that Make the Change ""Bad""?",jayjaybird0,12/07/2021,1,The big change is that event tokens are earned based on the amount of *time* spent playing games rather than the *number* of games. This means that gamemodes that can be completed quickly (such as ARAM) are no longer a more efficient way of completing event missions and grinding tokens.  Another change is that the players ability to earn tokens through TFT has been reduced (again).  &#x200B  Regarding the Prestige Shop its mostly that Grab Bags are noticeably less valuable than they were in previous years.
rbcez5,hnoop5u,hnoop5u,"If a Company Makes a Change that Benefits Them But Not the Consumer, Does that Make the Change ""Bad""?",wirebear,12/07/2021,2,A lot of the companies i have worked for in IT have indicated this is changing however. Where the relationship with a company is becoming more prominent and i.portant to people. I have seen this myself as well. Lots of people I know are looking for alternatives to facebook/amazon because they dont like the companies ethics or priorities
rbcez5,hnnqzjz,hnnqzjz,"If a Company Makes a Change that Benefits Them But Not the Consumer, Does that Make the Change ""Bad""?",DANKKlNG,12/07/2021,-1,Why dont you make a company and then start giving people triple the amount they pay for? You call it greed but you are literally soo clueless and ignorant.
rbcez5,hnnrubv,hnnrubv,"If a Company Makes a Change that Benefits Them But Not the Consumer, Does that Make the Change ""Bad""?",Odd_Play_5769,12/07/2021,2, If youre saying that RIOT is telling us we gave you too much loot the first time then thats their oversight and they can adjust it. But its digital its not food or something physical which is finite. Skin assets that are ten years old arent being paid for anymore gifting a few randomly each event isnt going to bankrupt RIOT.   Its like when you go to your favorite eatery and one day randomly there is 1/3rd less meat on the platter than there used to be. You might not complain to management but from the consumers end they have a right to be upset since theyre  paying the same as they were before but receiving less product.
rbcez5,hnooiqi,hnooiqi,"If a Company Makes a Change that Benefits Them But Not the Consumer, Does that Make the Change ""Bad""?",wirebear,12/07/2021,1,Problem is that triple what they paid for doesnt really work in digital products. There isnt a supply and demand scenario to defone value.   Digital products essentially come to be where companies are trying the most they can screw you while still selling reasonable amounts. This is due to reproduction having no cost other then internet usage fees. But sonce you dow load all the content in league this doesnt apply. Thus why enterprise software all follows different rules and pricing schemes. All of them are trying to find ways to squeeze more out of you without going too far.   There is no triple what you paid for because riot set the price that they are tripling.

But I quit for several years. Now Im only level 96 getting back into it the past few months. Im absolutely not diamond level rusty as hell and way worse than I was before. So all that to say nothing relevant at all.
rbc9k4,hnpag9a,hnpag9a,Amount of level <100 accounts in my last 10 ranked games in D1: 31,TheHecIsGoingOnTop,12/08/2021,0,I didnt ask for any discussion. Half the comments here are from others who understand the problem and the other half are regular players defending smurfs for no reason that i can think of. Made me realize that this is probably similar to politics in a sense.   Saying that level 40 + accounts are no smurfs is just beyond ridiculous imo. Im not even gonna bother to dig into big streamers accounts to make my point here. Friend of mine smurfs on a level 111 account and is probably one of the biggest smurfs you can meet in d1. I didnt even count all the other accounts which are level 100+ and clearly smurf accounts.
rbc9k4,hnqj1oe,hnqj1oe,Amount of level <100 accounts in my last 10 ranked games in D1: 31,YetAnotherBee,12/08/2021,1,Is it really worth it though?
rbc9k4,hnqivo2,hnqivo2,Amount of level <100 accounts in my last 10 ranked games in D1: 31,YetAnotherBee,12/08/2021,1,The sooner people realize that the people playing this game are more important than the game itself the better the community will be for it. Your slight tactical advantage from intentionally tilting an enemy has a very real impact on the lives and mental states of other people. How they act and react is out of your control of course but intentionally trying to do it is completely out of line and indecent. Respect real people over numbers friends.
rbc9k4,rbc9k4,rbc9k4,Amount of level <100 accounts in my last 10 ranked games in D1: 31,TheHecIsGoingOnTop,12/07/2021,5,* First i wanna state that any account under level 100 in Diamond 1 is 100% a 2nd account (smurf account banned) of any sort. * These accounts are overwhelmingly toxic players with nothing to lose at all * 31 is more than a 3rd of all players i´ve encountered in 10 games * At least every other of those players calls another pisslow or low elo or something similar (This even can lead to a wiener comparison who smurfs harder) * The main problem with smurfs as everyone knows is their potential and what they actually play like. Some spaceglide on you on twitch or run you down 1vs9 on yone ... some just say whatever and go afk or turbogrief the game  Today i was wondering again what it actually means to play in your designated elo Some games you play vs a smurf in your lane and you`re clearly getting your ass beaten.  Some games you play vs a smurf in your lane and they make a mistake and proceed to run it so you get fed. Some games your jungler or mid or top gets gapped or pops off because of one of those scenarios. And then again those smurfs are the most unreliable variable and very likely toxic to no end. This is no competitive environment by any means and im just sick of this shit so enjoy this rage thread. For now i´ve lost the rest of my sanity over this topic and that is a mountain i will happily die upon.  Yes it´s preseason and no it was´nt any better in the regular season

Smurfs are in every game and if a person plays at the level of a master he quickly climbs the ladder to his elo. Rather than whine about being destroyed by a Smurf better look at replay take it apart and take out something useful for yourself. Better yet add him and ask about the mechanic / routs / lane phase.
rbc9k4,hnocyej,hnocyej,Amount of level <100 accounts in my last 10 ranked games in D1: 31,Pinner1234,12/07/2021,0,I dont see much of the problem with this post as its getting much hate. Though I think OP wasnt much considerate prior Im a master player I do have a smurf though I understand the frustration matching someone in lane that is just better than you. At the end of the day if they are running it down it is what it is you can report them even though it wont do anything considering riot probably wont ban them and they will just buy another lvl 30 accounts. Either way smurfs are inevitable in any competitive game it is what it is everyone faces them you just have to coinflip they are an actual human being who wont run it down. Though I disagree with the ask them questions most of the smurfs are just egotistical and cringe If someone asks me a question Ill help them besides there is smurfq which is also a problem cause people get misplaced in it and literally every match in smurf q someone is trolling. Yeah it sucks it is what it is. Even in my high elo master games Im getting smurfed by gm and in some case challengers it happens to all of us and it does suck.

The Masters players who aren’t being toxic and coin-flippy in their attitude are who you should try to talk to instead and asking one of these smurfs for help will lead to bad advice massive shit-talking and/or feeding their already overblown ego

They dont give us those and they probably dont think about top lane enough to even have one.  Didnt they do this exact thing back in season 9? Wasnt he just oppressive for a good 6 months then removed from lane? The difference now is hes not playable as a support because of his R change. Removing him from top (a good thing) would delete the character from the game. He clearly needs another rework.

rbbwwd,rbbwwd,rbbwwd,Porofessor timer overlay is constantly wrong?,PossibleMedicine,12/07/2021,0,Are some of my setting wrong or something? The camp overlay gives me false times.   For example: killed a dragon - timer off with 2+ min for the next killing Red - Timer off with several minutes for the next etc.
rbbwwd,hnnj8bb,hnnj8bb,Porofessor timer overlay is constantly wrong?,Linyoa,12/07/2021,2,Are you playing normal summoners rift or ultimate spellbook? Cause I cant speak for porofessor but Ive noticed blitz gives incorrect timers in Ult Spellbook because the mode modifies jungle respawn timers.

rbbeou,rbbeou,rbbeou,Quick adc buff sugestion,Rexsaur,12/07/2021,0,While the current bad state of adcs is quite in the spotlight i came with a quick idea to make crit adcs feel better:  Make crit items give 25% crit instead of 20% make excess crit (over 100%) give the amount in crit damage instead.  What this does :  Allows adc to have both better 2 and 3 item spikes (50% and 75% instead of 40% and 60%) allows adc to cap out crit without going for a full crit build so it gives them more room for defensive items or items like GA which dont have crit without losing all their damage.  At full build allows them to have the old 200% crit damage if going for a glass cannon build (which is fair considering only a single crit item even gives anything defensive so they get rewarded by actually dealing damage with crits if they go full glass).  Also reduce the cost of IE by 200~300 gold item is really bad as it is.  Thoughts? Of course they could just give crit back its 200% base damage without any of this but im trying to be reasonable here.
rbbeou,hnncweu,hnncweu,Quick adc buff sugestion,DSNSinh,12/07/2021,5,It would be broken in champs like yasuo yone crit yi and senna (because of the scaling range) in pro player hands this is just too good
rbbeou,hnnebm6,hnnebm6,Quick adc buff sugestion,Odd_Play_5769,12/07/2021,2,Its 20% right now because they added crit to several items that uses to not have it. Crit % is fine right now
rbbeou,hnne8in,hnne8in,Quick adc buff sugestion,dannyboyheinz,12/07/2021,-1,Why would the class that is picked in 98% of games by both teams need a buff?
rbbeou,hnnfkrt,hnnfkrt,Quick adc buff sugestion,Blue_Seraph,12/07/2021,1,>Make crit items give 25% crit instead of 20%  Could work given minor tweaks to the Marksmen items stats. Would open up build options which is always a positive. Might need to consider tweaks for Rageblade as well though.  &#x200B  >make excess crit (over 100%) give the amount in crit damage instead.  Would be broken late game and bring crit Marksmen back to their Burst Per Second days. Sure full build games rarely happen but we really dont need Jinx Twitch crit Senna crit MF and Corki to be ***even more*** unstoppable when they do.  It would also require a lot of tinkering on Senna Yasuo and Yone  &#x200B  >At full build allows them to have the old 200% crit damage if going for a glass cannon build  More like 260% with IE (or 285% if you sell boots for a second Zeal item ). Which is higher than the 250% they used to do in a game without mythic items giving them additional damage procs mobility or Survivability. So burst per second meta it is again indeed.  &#x200B  >(which is fair considering only a single crit item even gives anything defensive so they get rewarded by actually dealing damage with crits if they go full glass).  Lifesteal can be argued as a defensive stat and even if it wasnt the BT shield is a defensive effect so along with Mercurial and Shieldbow that is 3 items. Not much but its there  &#x200B  >Also reduce the cost of IE by 200\~300 gold item is really bad as it is.  True and reduce Deathcaps cost too while were at it. Capstone items are pricey for a reason.  &#x200B  Honestly the best thing they could do is probably either :  • Give Marksmen a 4th mythic tailor made for crit adcs that would give 25% crit and have +5% crit as its mythic passive.  • Turn KrakenSlayer into said mythic and have its proc damage scale with crit.
rbbeou,hnnxoja,hnnxoja,Quick adc buff sugestion,iloveJpop,12/07/2021,1,omg i cant wait to see tf blade get rank 1 2 3 with this on tryn   I agree do this
rbbeou,hnndckr,hnndckr,Quick adc buff sugestion,Pohladin,12/07/2021,-1,By your logic Caitlyn and Tristana can sell boots for 6th crit item Firecannon in the build Alistar or Leona on peel duty tank jungle and top and they basicly turn into a fortress that you can’t even touch and they break your bones with the extra damage on top. Oneshotting through a single trap from half a lane away lategame and Tristana’s Q allowing her to buy crit damage items instead of AS crit items seems a bit too much don’t you think?  Those are just two adcs feel free to disagree.
rbbeou,hnnd4c4,hnnd4c4,Quick adc buff sugestion,Rexsaur,12/07/2021,1,Neither of those champs are played in pro play.  And they could always make compensation nerfs for them so they stay in the same spot as they are now.
rbbeou,hnnf2kg,hnnf2kg,Quick adc buff sugestion,homer12346,12/07/2021,3,botlane marksmen both want crit chance on ldr and 25% crit chance and 250% IE passive
rbbeou,hnnejv5,hnnejv5,Quick adc buff sugestion,KasumiGotoTriss,12/07/2021,5,This has always been the dumbest argument ever. This role is in every game so its fine lmfao. Did you know 100% of games have a jungler! I think that role needs a nerf.
rbbeou,hnndpkn,hnndpkn,Quick adc buff sugestion,Rexsaur,12/07/2021,1,So you mean a 6 item adc with a full damage build would be very high damage threats if they have a team peeling for them?  Really? And you say THIS is too much? Wtf do you want adcs to do then? What is their role in the game? Not matter at all stages of the game while building all damage items? Free kills for other roles to feel good?
rbbeou,hno0t4r,hno0t4r,Quick adc buff sugestion,TheRealGouki,12/07/2021,2,Because yasuo isnt play at worlds doesnt make it a never pick he played alot in local leagues https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Yasuo/Match_History
rbbeou,hnnfjcq,hnnfjcq,Quick adc buff sugestion,Odd_Play_5769,12/07/2021,1,Agreed. I think these requests are reasonable. Perhaps we could also reduce the price of bloodthirster while upping its AD damage just to be safe.
rbbeou,hnnfem0,hnnfem0,Quick adc buff sugestion,dannyboyheinz,12/07/2021,-1,A jungler can be a tank bruiser mage marksman etc. The jungle role has great diversity with champs for every playstyle.  Bots diversity is 98% marksman Yasuo and the 2 or 3 mages that Riot allows to remain niche viable.
rbbeou,hnneyn5,hnneyn5,Quick adc buff sugestion,homer12346,12/07/2021,0,class =/= role
rbbeou,hnndv7n,hnndv7n,Quick adc buff sugestion,Pohladin,12/07/2021,0,Why do you even ask the question or make an proposition if you disagree and scream your thing?
rbbeou,hnnfkis,hnnfkis,Quick adc buff sugestion,KasumiGotoTriss,12/07/2021,1,Mages are fine bot if melee champs could reliably lane against an adc + a support then it would mean adc is actually the most worthless thing ever.
rbbeou,hnnf917,hnnf917,Quick adc buff sugestion,KasumiGotoTriss,12/07/2021,2,Just because adcs are in all games doesnt mean theyre a good class youd much rather have a fed bruiser/assassin/mage than an adc. They deal way too little damage for how squishy they are. I literally got oneshot by a full tank + cosmic drive Zac the other day but he was extremely tanky as well. Why would I not play that instead of an adc? Not to mention you depend on your support so much that it never feels like you have any impact other than some minion management.
rbbeou,hnne0q2,hnne0q2,Quick adc buff sugestion,Rexsaur,12/07/2021,1,You did not awnser to my question.
rbbeou,hnnykd9,hnnykd9,Quick adc buff sugestion,iloveJpop,12/07/2021,1,he already knew that he would reply with if they have a team peeling for them before he read your comment
rbbeou,hnnfyq9,hnnfyq9,Quick adc buff sugestion,dannyboyheinz,12/07/2021,0,2 or 3 mages are niche viable at best in bot. Thats not diversity. And every other lane mixes ranged and melee champs without issue. Bot should be the same way.
rbbeou,hnnevoc,hnnevoc,Quick adc buff sugestion,Pohladin,12/07/2021,1,Frankly the role is a coinflip preseason deletes and every character getting a gapcloser makes your life miserable but getting free 50 % increase for your damage + IE is way too fucking much. If enemy adc snowballs you are screwed.  I hereby retire from this thread with saying that you proposed a Jinx buff to her Q to deal 5x more damage to monsters to make her jungle winrate go up unironically.  Have a good day sir.
rbbeou,hnne4gg,hnne4gg,Quick adc buff sugestion,Pohladin,12/07/2021,1,If you as a Jinx main ask me what is the role IDK chief.
rbbeou,hnnh2js,hnnh2js,Quick adc buff sugestion,Rexsaur,12/07/2021,3,Meanwhile ranged champs (and tanks) have been more or less trollpicks top lane ever since like season 10 for the longest time.  Dont see you guys saying bring back kennen and gnar to top lane bring back ornn and maokai we must have variety instead of 2 bruisers every game.
rbbeou,hnnem2p,hnnem2p,Quick adc buff sugestion,Rexsaur,12/07/2021,0,Im glad you get the point then.  That is exactly the problem adcs have no real role they excel at anymore they are outclassed.

I do agree that true tanks could use a buff of some sort but they are still viable for sure. Every class has representation in top lane. Only 2 classes and Yasuo have viability bot.
rbbeou,hno38qg,hno38qg,Quick adc buff sugestion,Dasdi96,12/07/2021,1,Tanks have been troll picks in toplane ever since conq was made in 8.6. This rune singlehandedly killed an entire class of champions.

But it seriously blew my mind. Could easily be the best show of 2021.   But my honest opinion for a season 2 is that Jinx VI and Caitlyns story should end with season 1. Its a imperfect ending but it left us with a powerful cliffhanger. What I reckon is that each season should be a story for every storyline in LoL.

rbawsq,hnox29x,hnox29x,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,Sondeor,12/08/2021,-6,I personally think that LT is not that broken tbh. Its more like people doesnt know or care what the enemy players runes are and they dont play with considering what you have.   I am also a Yasuo/Yone player (play every role actually but this year i go mid) and i never lost my lane against LT never! Not even once. Just dont fight with a lethal tempo Yasuo or Yone or whatever you are facing in the early game.   IMO LT is also very weak when its mid/late game where most of the runes are buffing and rewarding mid/late game like conq LT stays the same and when everybody starts to one shot everybody it doesnt effect whatever your Attack speed is because you will only have a very short moment of time to make a play anyway.  Dont get me wrong im not saying that LT is weak but its also not that OP like Conquerer was for literally months. People just need to use their brain a little bit more or maybe they need to play more against LT and after some time it wont feel that way.   And also who told you that Yone has to be weak early lol. Its one of the strongest early champs after level 3 because of his skillset. I am not trying to be rude but you dont seem to be knowing the game that much imo this complete post feels silver in general not judging or shaming its just not true what you guys say.

rbawsq,hnq2s3y,hnq2s3y,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,xObiJuanKenobix,12/08/2021,1,Yone is literally designed to be dogshit early and then scale into a monster thats the whole design of the kit. Same with Kayle kassadin kogmaw aphelios etc. If youre saying dont fight Yone early then theres no point where hes weak. Once he got shieldbow before he could 1v1 pretty much every champ in the game now he starts the game as a monster.  Youre trying so hard to justify a broken rune by saying just dont ever fight the champ and youll be fine!

rbawsq,hnprp6i,hnprp6i,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,NymphomaniacWalrus,12/08/2021,1,Because with the nerfs this patch and the buffs to Conqueror theres an actual thought process for bruisers now in terms of runes.  Lethal Tempo is way worse in teamfights and in terms of scaling than Conqueror is for most bruisers (Gwen Jax Kled Irelia etc). You cant stack it as fast it doesnt give you survivability it doesnt affect your abilities scalings like Conqueror does.  Its an option if you want to have a lane bully playstyle while sacrificing late game power. It has its egregious cases much like any other rune or items and should be balanced accordingly but acting like Lethal Tempo is the second coming of Courage of the Colossus or Thunderlords Decree is just wrong. The rune is fine it just needs tuning and the egregious cases like Yone and Yasuo need to be targetted specifically.
rbawsq,hnqdomy,hnqdomy,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,ScumbagMotherfucker,12/08/2021,1,There is the simplest counter possible to lethal tempo. Just don’t take long trades. Simple as that. I mean whatever. you can cry about it or adjust your play style and win more. I’m disconnected from the rest of the player base because I understand how the game works? I can say the majority of the playerbase is disconnected from the reality by playing the same way into different conditions and expecting the same results all the time. Also there are about 30 champions with 52+ wr. I agree vayne is broken but it’s not because of the lethal tempo.
rbawsq,hnpy929,hnpy929,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,ScumbagMotherfucker,12/08/2021,1,Camille fiora jax akshan. You don’t really need help in this lane unless enemy jungle hard camps you. Proc his bone plating wait till it goes down and short trade repeat until he’s dead or out of lane. It’s really not a hard lane and at least one of these champs are usually open. I don’t really see much trundle on my elo but on alts in master and below  I’m yet to lose a lane vs him. Can’t really speak from a perspective of gold player. Trundle can’t really respond to short trades when you have any sort of cc or mobility
rbawsq,hnqkki0,hnqkki0,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,ColdFire252,12/08/2021,1,I get some of what you are saying but from my experience Camille vs trundle is certainly not winning if you engage into him early he will simply pillar and run you down there is fuck all you can do vs it so you are forced to play passive and e away from him when he runs at you fiora I question I think unless you block his ult if that’s possible or if you manage to w his pillar then maybe but otherwise no and akshan is ranged top with mobility that specifically counters trundle
rbawsq,hnqld9n,hnqld9n,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,ScumbagMotherfucker,12/08/2021,1,Camille doesn’t have a losing matchup except maybe jax right now so if you are losing vs trundle it means you play her wrong. Fiora just runs him down same with Jax. Just watch matchup videos on YouTube and you will learn how to play vs him and LT users in general. If you play Camille properly there is no way trundle ever wins that lane. Jungle would have to hard camp you for trundle to have a shot at winning this lane and even then you are pretty much undivable.
rbawsq,hnqtun0,hnqtun0,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,ColdFire252,12/08/2021,1,Are you honestly saying that Camille can 100-0 trundle without a sheen before trundle does the same to her? If you honestly think that you are delirious in addition Camille has to land w and e in order to even have a chance also fiora would have to get every single vital ASAP in order to win and even in trundle w makes that rather difficult not to mention the as buff that he is getting that stacks with LT
rbawsq,rbawsq,rbawsq,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,xObiJuanKenobix,12/07/2021,31,This is coming from a Yone Kled player this rune needs removed/reverted back to before. I dont know how this made it through testing. I thought Shieldbow on Yone was the worst thing Riot ever created until this came along. Yone is designed to be a weak early insane late game champion and now with LT hes a monster from level 1. Gets his Q and W down to the lowest cooldown on full stacks while getting stacks with Q he can literally win most 1v1 at lvl 1-3 now. Kled too just gets instant remounts now with it feels so unfair to even fight its like having my violent tendencies W up at all times. Also I gain attack range when dismounted plus this rune maxed gives me 300 RANGE MELEE AUTO ATTACKS.  Either revert it to old LT until something actually balanced can be created or make the attack speed scale throughout the game. Make it like 10% - 90% throughout the game or something. Makes no sense for it to give the full 90% bonus at all points of the game. Imagine if conq gave its full AD/AP at all levels 1-18 like 30 ad and 50 ap or whatever it gives. But something needs to be done ASAP this and Shieldbow need quick fixes. But LT needs it more because you have it from the start of the game atleast with Shieldbow you have to buy it.
rbawsq,hnnagid,hnnagid,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,Minute_Course747,12/07/2021,26,Its actually insane how someone thought this rune would be alright to not have any scaling... like dont all the others have some sort of level scaling? I dont really understand how it got past any sort of playtesting giving this much AS at level 1
rbawsq,hnn9qq2,hnn9qq2,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,S7EFEN,12/07/2021,29,yeah theres literally no way that LT is going to be balanced. its either broken as fuck on yas yone or its trash on everyone else and balanced on them

rbawsq,hno8fpi,hno8fpi,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,MapPotential9009,12/07/2021,2,Based on Riots previous attempts to balance things Im not even surprised LT was allowed to go live. The nerf did nothing. Im at a 100% winrate with Trundle at the moment post LT nerf only 10 games but still thats a decent performance and theyre not just wins theyre complete stomps. Before it was even worse. If you cant beat em join em.
rbawsq,hnnd0he,hnnd0he,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,getjebaited,12/07/2021,4,they dont think their champs have overloaded kits overall so why should their runes be any different

rbawsq,hnni2e4,hnni2e4,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,Ill-Discussion3408,12/07/2021,-1,People act like is beyond easy to stack before your dead when it isnt and all the videos ive seen comapring to other runes shows its not anything thats too crazy to handle except on a few key champions. . its really just pisses people off that over extend against nonranged auto attackers and cant back out of there mistake.
rbawsq,hnndqfu,hnndqfu,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,ProdigyOfIron,12/07/2021,1,As a trundle and wukong player I love the new tempo :D

Maybe if you have the mentality of “me see enemy me go long trade ad infinitum” it might be oppressive to play against. IMO this rune is the biggest noob trap riot has ever released to prod
rbawsq,hnnhqas,hnnhqas,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,Ill-Discussion3408,12/07/2021,-7,I feel like its strong on like 4 champs. The rest have better choices. Tryndamire yone darius and kled thats really about it.
rbawsq,hnnaufv,hnnaufv,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,xObiJuanKenobix,12/07/2021,8,Just remember that all the insane items weve gotten got past testing too. Stridebreaker with 300 range gap closer Goredrinker healing Chemtech movement speed Axiom arc ult reduction Immortal shieldbow with all its healing and shielding etc. Like it doesnt surprise me this got past testing but at the same time just blows my mind it doesnt have any scaling.
rbawsq,hnnab91,hnnab91,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,xObiJuanKenobix,12/07/2021,14,Theres no way to make this balanced for anyone getting 90% attack speed essentially for free is nowhere near balanced for anything. Remember sanguine blade when that first came out?? And everyone who built it first would get like 110% attack speed in lane permanently? I remember building it on Pantheon when it first released and the enemy literally couldnt to anything to me.   And their fix is to reduce it from 90% to 78% when maxed as if that does literally anything to fix the problem. Lets put it this way Phantom Dancer gives 25% attack speed and then 30% more attack speed when you have 4 stacks for a total of 55% for 2600g. This rune gives you 78-90% depending on the patch for 5 stacks for FREE.  And now what are they gonna do theyre gonna nerf the fun parts of Yone instead of actually fixing the issue like they did with amumu last preseason. Sunfire was stupid on him but they nerfed his kit like 4 times in a row instead of nerfing sunfire.
rbawsq,hnnafzq,hnnafzq,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,homer12346,12/07/2021,0,so just fix the yasyon interaction and boom its done

rbawsq,hnnn945,hnnn945,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,DeleteAllWeebs,12/07/2021,6,Well you see the key word is overall the old champs have weak undertuned kits so if the new ones are overloaded it and overtuned it balances out in their twisted world.
rbawsq,hnnv6xg,hnnv6xg,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,xObiJuanKenobix,12/07/2021,6,It is easy to stack all the champions who use it have very easy ways to stack it.  Yone Gwen Irelia Jax Trundle Tryndamere Kled Yasuo Vayne Jinx Kogmaw all have attack speed buffs attack resets or both that make them crazy for stacking it. Not to mention once they get 1 item its almost instant to stack it for some champs like Irelia Jax and Yone/Yasuo.
rbawsq,hnojx3s,hnojx3s,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,DeleteAllWeebs,12/07/2021,2,You mean people are annoyed that they cant KITE A MELEE CHAMP Im shocked...

rbawsq,hnnuyap,hnnuyap,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,xObiJuanKenobix,12/07/2021,7,In Diamond+ Vayne has a 53.55% winrate with a 14.4% pickrate Trundle and Kled both have almost 52% winrates Jinx has the highest pickrate in bot lane with a 51.4% winrate using LT Jax Irelia Trundle and Tryndamere just run down anyone in top lane even more than before.  It really isnt that good is complete bullshit
rbawsq,hno8c6u,hno8c6u,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,MapPotential9009,12/07/2021,4,Have you vsd a Trundle with LT? He locks you down and beats the crap out of you its glorious
rbawsq,hnnndw7,hnnndw7,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,DeleteAllWeebs,12/07/2021,8,Irelia Trundle Gwen Wukong Jax just off the top of my head the rune is OP AF and needs to be reverted.  Not to even mention how its making Vayne a no skill champ.
rbawsq,hnnbb3d,hnnbb3d,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,Minute_Course747,12/07/2021,1,Yea true. Its just hard like they thought conq the previous sustained damage rune was strong enough to be nerfed and then created something even stronger.... ?????
rbawsq,hnnerl3,hnnerl3,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,Odd_Play_5769,12/07/2021,-5,And lets not forget its gutted for ADCs who used to use it. The attack range doesnt matter because I have to attack in my initial range to get it. Why would I need added range to attack you when Im already jn range attacking you? Lol. It only helps when theyre running away which lets face it no one is running away from ADCs even fed ones. This should surprise anyone though since they purposely changed jt to make it a melee rune.  At least the old one had a cooldown window you could play around. The new one doesnt.
rbawsq,hnnfa2y,hnnfa2y,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,homer12346,12/07/2021,-1,amumu was sleeper strong even before sunfire preseason
rbawsq,hnnc2nf,hnnc2nf,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,DeleteAllWeebs,12/07/2021,5,Tryndamere Kled Trundle and Irelia all 4 can literally run people down in their own minion wave tank the entire wave and kill them at level 1.  The rune is warping the top lane meta in completely unhealthy ways.  Late game scaling champs like Yone are now also good early I get what riot is trying to go for but unfortunately its too good early.  Giving 1500ish gold value at level 1 isnt OK thatd be like an ADC starting the game with a free BF sword theres no way thats OK.
rbawsq,hnofunt,hnofunt,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,Ill-Discussion3408,12/07/2021,-1,Ive seen a video comparing  irelia jax trynd yas yone yi sett garen nasus and sum others in 1v1 duels using different runes. Like a yi vrs yi one uses conq the other leathal tempo and they just stand there fighting it out.  Lethal tempo was better on yi trynd trundle  and yas  .the others conq won out on a majority of them . it was op on tryndamire. I might be missing a couple champs it was alot of them but the guy doing the video on youtube was showing all the champs and the results of each one . maybe its just the way it feels to engage on. Im not a fan of it.. Id like it to be a max 60 percent instead. and It feels more punishing then conq in short trades and alot of top lane dueling lately in my ingame experiemce has been short trades.  Idk man. Theres so much wrong with the game im getting desensitized by shit like this lol
rbawsq,hnolstn,hnolstn,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,Ill-Discussion3408,12/07/2021,1,As a melle champ they cant kite out of the damage yes
rbawsq,hno73f0,hno73f0,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,ScumbagMotherfucker,12/07/2021,-6,Ah yes because vayne isn’t currently broken because of cheap rage blade and shieldbow+witsend combo. Also don’t really get your point of 52% win rate being something out of ordinary. Jax and irelia picking lt are actually much easier to play around than conq ones. I’m 800lp euw so I think I have pretty good understanding of the meta. Trynda is a fundamentally broken champ with no place in modern day league so yes he’s broken with any rune for that matter and lt made him even steronger. It really isn’t that good especially on ranged champions. Idk maybe in lower elos it’s better but then again when I’m playing in Alts it still seems weaker to conq
rbawsq,hno9w66,hno9w66,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,ScumbagMotherfucker,12/07/2021,-4,Of course I played vs him. Really easy to counterpick and play around

Gwen might be good using it but poppy def isnt.  Also as someone who plays Gwen can you honestly tell me getting 1.5 attack speed at level 1 from a rune is fair?
rbawsq,hnndz92,hnndz92,Lethal Tempo is the biggest abomination riot has created this entire year,uuab,12/07/2021,-1,yes thats why conq gets buffed bcs if smths broken they have to break other stuff to be able to compete xD. riot logic works just fine :).

rbatzo,hnp4xq3,hnp4xq3,Open camera,JohannesLee,12/08/2021,1,Bind Lock screen to spacebar (default bind:Y) and you just have to tap it instead thats what I do.
rbatzo,rbatzo,rbatzo,Open camera,xxbotxx123V,12/07/2021,0,Dear people who use open camera!  I’m in a desperate need of advice on how to use open camera.   My champ pool  consists of skill shot mages and lots of poke and I kept  being told to just unlock my camera and play like that. I gave  it a go like a week ago but it just doesn’t feel right. I never find the right angle the movement is jittery and I often overslide it. What do I do? I’m desperate because locked camera sucks when I’m top side  of the map but when I’m open cam im too focused on adjusting the cam and not focusing on the game ://
rbatzo,hnn9xdr,hnn9xdr,Open camera,DRtedybear,12/07/2021,3,What I do is use unlocked camera when I have to I like the camera on me however. Peeking or looking is super helpful so unlocked is super important to learn playing the game locked when I can is best for me.  Start off slow. If you have a button on your mouse I use that to lock/unlock my camera.  What you can do if the speed is annoying start off low not the lowest but low like 30 or maybe 40. Every day move the sense up a bit by like 1 or 2.  I just used it a little every game until I got used to it until I feel comfortable.
rbatzo,hnn96n5,hnn96n5,Open camera,Pretend_Yam6590,12/07/2021,7,force yourself to get used to it. its uncomfortable at first but its a necessity to getting good.
rbatzo,hnn95dq,hnn95dq,Open camera,Riven4,12/07/2021,1,theres a camera sensitivity setting that helps with oversliding  and press spacebar to recenter
rbatzo,hnndxxx,hnndxxx,Open camera,Caryatis72,12/07/2021,1,I definitely wouldnt recommend playing with locked camera however always moving cursor to the edge of the screen and back felt very counter-intuitive to me.  So what I did was bind Drag Scroll under Hotkeys > Camera Control  to Space (bind Center Camera On Champion to something else I use a mouse button for example) and enable Mouse button drag scroll under Game. That way you can pan your camera when pressing spacebar.  Ive been playing like that for years and never looked back. Its probably just a personal preference but maybe its worth sharing. But every change needs some time getting used to.
rbatzo,hnngfh3,hnngfh3,Open camera,sledki,12/07/2021,1,I pretty much keep my thumb on space bar all game unless actively trying to look elsewhere.
rbatzo,hnnjceo,hnnjceo,Open camera,85-Red_Beard,12/07/2021,1,I think its just something you need to get used to over time. When I first started playing league back around 2012 I had already been playing RTS games for over 15 years. I was so used to having a free camera that when I accidentally locked it one time I was really weirded out.
rbatzo,hnnmrk0,hnnmrk0,Open camera,Fearless-Video7989,12/07/2021,1,I played on locket camera for quite a while so when changing i started with arams and then later i played normal on a low-level account i was able to transition quicker than i expected.
rbatzo,hnnojs4,hnnojs4,Open camera,DarkEyeLOL,12/07/2021,1,I have been diamond for four years consecutively now by semi unlocking the camera. Which means that I only unlock the camera when really needed its just up to personal preference I guess.
rbatzo,hnnqpzj,hnnqpzj,Open camera,ThePl4yer1,12/07/2021,1,you can slow the camera movementspeed in the settingsdunno exactly where atm  if you want to get back to yourself press space  you can create a custom game so you have enough time to set it up right
rbatzo,hno9ufa,hno9ufa,Open camera,Mlholland4321,12/07/2021,1,Just go in the practice tool unlock the camera and spend some time getting used to moving around the map and moving the camera with your character. It’s a bit different than the pressure of a real gamebut it gives you as much time as you need just to get used to the fact you have to move the camera with your character.
rbatzo,hno3vql,hno3vql,Open camera,rypenguin219,12/07/2021,1,this is what i do too especially playing from the red side when the ui and map block a lotta stuff. I have space bound to unlock/lock and its really fast for me to switch.

And it enables you to play far more aggressively or gives you pure immunity to specific types of champs in grouped up fights.  >Meanwhile Stopwatch can be built by literally anyone and Shieldbow is viable on so many champion classes.  stopwatch is better but stopwatch is single use. Shieldbow is... well pretty good but its just a shield. It doesnt swing matchups the way hourglass does into champs that have single core spells or really no ability to disengage/reengage.

rbaj6u,hnp593g,hnp593g,We should know when a Lifeline passive is up,catseye013,12/08/2021,-8,What? No. Keeping track off enemy cooldowns and playing around them is a HUGE part of skill display in this game. Why would you remove it for lifeline items? Do you also think other items should be publicly visible? What about flash?  Reddit really needs to stop with this stupid fucking “if it’s like this for one thing it has to be like this for literally everything in the game” argument. It’s stupid as hell and you just fall down a massive rabbit hole where you either make the game overly frustrating and complicated or pathetically easy.

rbaj6u,hnp5gy6,hnp5gy6,We should know when a Lifeline passive is up,catseye013,12/08/2021,-16,So you do think flash or other item passives and actives should be publicly shown aswell? Lifeline doesn’t get special treatment at all. You’re just comparing it to other items that are publicly visible.  There’s no visible change for Zhonyas being up or flash or Everfrost or Galeforce or heal etc.  Playing around lifeline items is just skill. Stupid as fuck to remove that and make the game 100x easier just because spell shields exist when those function completely different. Stop comparing everything 1:1 and act like every interaction in the game has to be identical it’s completely fine for unique or different interactions to exist.  Just goes back to the stupid ass “if adcs are weak behind then assassins should be too” thread. If one role is weak from behind shouldn’t every role be? Should all roles have the same strengths and weaknesses to make it fair? No.

rbaj6u,hnpzs17,hnpzs17,We should know when a Lifeline passive is up,GordionKnot,12/08/2021,-3,the comment i responded to wasn’t talking about a visual indicator read it again. they’re saying that cho’gath ult (or any move with enough damage) shouldn’t trigger shieldbow if they’re doing more damage than the user has health.  so the item that’s supposed to stop adcs from getting one-shot would be extra weak to one-shots. as well as a pretty big arbitrary buff to characters who happen to do their damage in one hit.

Timing camps items and summenor spells was a unique skillset that gave your team a fair advantage over someone who didnt. Although I agree that it seems inconsistent to show Crown etc. but not lifeline/QSS Id hate for Riot to remove something that gives players a rare and unique macro skill to gain an advantage especially in elos below Masters.

rbaei9,rbaei9,rbaei9,Bounties are a huge disappointment.,Mrskillmob,12/07/2021,2,In the current state bounties are not doing what they are intended to. Let me give you an example.   You are playing jungle. All your lanes are even and within the first 8minutes of the game you get 6 kills. You as a jungler get ahead a lot. 6 kills can give you cca 1800gold. But because your lanes are all like 0/0/2 or 1/0/0 it doesnt affect lanes that much. You snowball your lead and get 13 kills by 15minute mark. Suddenly your team is ahead by cca 3000 gold and most of this gold is on your single player that popped off that game. Suddenly enemy team gets bounties. The game is basically even except that one guy. Enemies are able to win 5v5s because they are not bad players and are capable of focusing one person. They are able to take multiple bounties like this while the player that popped off is not able to do anything about it. Enemy team is suddenly almost even with the player that popped off and therefore a lot stronger than rest of his team. Enemy win. The game punishes your team for you being too good. If you dont believe me this literally happened this game:  [https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/match/eune/2994840055#participant2](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/match/eune/2994840055#participant2)   Possible solution is that instead of just taking your team gold vs enemy team gold it should be team gold/5 to see what the average gold advantage per player is not just one player being ahead too much. Also bounties should be that you take one bounty objective and the bounty ends immediately. In current state team is able to get 2 or even 3 at a time because they can take this bounties within the small time period.
rbaei9,hnnh5ql,hnnh5ql,Bounties are a huge disappointment.,lerspinez,12/07/2021,2,Hoarding all the gold and try to hypercarry by yourself has always been high risk/high reward. It is true that the new objective bounties have sharpened the risk somewhat but it is not as if they made a very reliable strategy into a useless one.  Honestly looking at the stats I think you could easily have lost this game before objective bounties were released. Your team did nothing with the advantage you created in the early game (Vayne ended up losing against Cait) their Viego kept himself in the game as much as he could and the enemy team composition was extremely well suited to deal with your Master Yi as a single threat with lots of CC and two point-and-click disables.  You also gave two huge bounties at minutes 11:00 (10-kill streak) and 20:00 (15-kill streak) which likely contributed to your demise. You really cant afford to die if you happen to be carrying the entirety of your teams gold advantage.  Sure you lost *faster* that you would have before objective bounties but even without them the enemy team at least on paper had a decent chance of making a comeback.
rbaei9,hnn6m26,hnn6m26,Bounties are a huge disappointment.,HalexUwU,12/07/2021,2,Sounds like this just punishes players for taking too many kills.  &#x200B  Its good to have someone whos fed but giving \~3000 or more gold to ONE player is just unnecessary.
rbaei9,hnntt6j,hnntt6j,Bounties are a huge disappointment.,epzme,12/07/2021,1,I mean when you do get kills your laners get cs xp and plates. The enemy champion loses cs and xp. It’s pretty taxing already for the enemy.   I just wish the would lower the gold value. I think it swings too much.
rbaei9,hnn7f1d,hnn7f1d,Bounties are a huge disappointment.,Mrskillmob,12/07/2021,1,sometimes you get too many solo kills and there is just simply no way to share and for example the game than I showed giving kills to Yi kinda makes sense both lux and cho are worse at snowballing funneling gold to Yi has even been an reliable tactic in the past. (taric-yi lulu-yi old kayle-yi...)
rbae7o,rbae7o,rbae7o,Qiyanna ult working as intended I guess,PoderSensuaaaal,12/07/2021,0, Just lost an ARAM game because Riot seems to not be able to fix their hitboxes I am playing as tristana (one of the champions with the smallest hitboxes on the game btw) and get absolutely fucked up because maybe if they fix the hitboxes Azir will get another bug.  Like I dont know how hard it can be but its not just qiyanna ult its a lot of hitboxes most of them being crowd control skillshots like all the hooks morgana and lux q etc.  I know even they have said that the base code is so bad that it is too hard to fix some things like Nunu invisible W or when they straight up had to rework morde because they couldnt fix the 100 bug long list he had.  Maybe it would be time to consider re-doing the code from 0 as if it were League of Legends 2 I know it must be a lot of money and time but thinking about all the headaches it will save (maybe Riot client will stop crushing everytime they enable clash)  &#x200B  https://reddit.com/link/rbae7o/video/unj2zwuyx6481/player

rbacyz,hnpjcf4,hnpjcf4,"Shieldbow is neither the issue nor the solution to the lackluster feeling of marksmen, yet it manages to be BOTH problematic AND lackluster",SmellyDogPoop,12/08/2021,1,words to factually describe the state of anything are not buzzwords ironically using the term buzzword to downplay something you cant form a proper argument to disagree with is the fucking buzzword.
rbacyz,rbacyz,rbacyz,"Shieldbow is neither the issue nor the solution to the lackluster feeling of marksmen, yet it manages to be BOTH problematic AND lackluster",ruffydm1,12/07/2021,0,TLDR AT THE BOTTOM but do please read all of it its not too long winded!  After seeing a lot of posts on the frontpage in recent weeks about the lackluster feeling of playing marksmen i decided to chime in with my own thoughts about the role or more specifically shieldbow and the 3 biggest issues it creates in its current state.  Shieldbow currently excels on a few select marksmen like Vayne/Akshan that have the innate damage needed as well as the mobility to neither need kraken slayer or galeforce which is what marksmen IN THEORY all should be capable of so why dont they? Well it comes down to a factor of multitudes but the most important one neither of them are reliant on crit/infinity edge. Not only does this allow them to forego clunky and expensive items like infinity edge BUT at the same time have an earlier spike with combinations like SB/Wits end or SB/rageblade some other marksmen are capable of it as well like ashe/kogmaw.   So shieldbow is actually doing good work on a few marksmen ist that great!?   Well in theory sure but it highlights the issue of all the other marksmen they are either gated behind clunky buildpaths not having enough innate damage/mobility to not take kraken/galeforce leaving them easily taken down by bruisers/assassins in the early to mid game while often not reaching the late game power fantasy therefore the feeling or even complete lack of agency. Building shieldbow on marksmen not having the qualities i mentioned therefore fail to make use of shieldbow and often FEEL lackluster in the current meta even if their performance indicates otherwise for example Caitlyn that is the 1st issue.  The 2nd issue shieldbow creates is the infamous Shieldbow brothers AKA Yasuo and Yone both of the champions were designed with the intention of having clear weaknesses that being no innate sustain as well as only having CONDITIONAL durabiliy in the form of their shields in their early/mid game. Choosing to opt into either of those (Armor/MR/Vamp scepter/PD) would delay their 2 item spike/weaken it (PD/BT build was not a thing for a reason) OR only let them achieve one or the other (sustain/durability) while also building some form of attack speed needed for Q breakpoints.   Currently both Yasuo and Yone are able to grab shieldbow as their 1st item and still put out on curve DPS that would be expected of a Zeal item rush while letting them aquire sustain early in their build path and once the item is complete durability as well all in one neat package. All of this leaves the room to actually fight back against them very marginal AND it also feels really bad to actually play into to since the intended dynamic of the matchups gets so skewed compared to their intended design.   But Yasuo still have negative winrate and yone barley enters 51% winrate how can they be problematic!?  Winrate is not the only metric for balance and again the point is not if shieldbow is balanced or not but if shieldbow creates issues in regards to game health or creates issue in game design/player satisfaction. Currently it manages to fit the criteria of the two latter ones.   So moving on from there what is then the 3rd issue that shieldbow creates? Its in regards to player satisfaction not only on the receiving end of a shieldbow proc but also on the opposing side of one. Shieldbow unlike its younger mage cousin Crown of the shattered queen manages to be far less elegant in the way it allows for counterplay/interaction. Crown have a clearcut way of interacting with it Poke me away and i wont be in your way! while choosing to not do so means the shattered queen will have one or two words to say about that. Shieldbow on the other hand simply says You have to deal 300-800 excess damage to interact normally with the champion you are targeting!. The only exception being Serpents fang which is already a niche item but also a few shield destroying abilities if your champion is not able to aquire one or its simply too early in the game then tough luck you wont have a good time.   Ill paint an example here Ekko trying to fight a marksman with a shieldbow that have even gold as him will not be able to completley take down said Marksman that miss positions and gets stunned by his W during the entirity of his W stun or soon after expiration letting them slip away so it will feel like there was nothing he could have done better. On the other hand if the ekko is already ahead and fed he will simply one shot the Marksman as if there were not any shieldbow existing in the first place. If crown is put in the same position it will mitigage MOST of the upfront burst and keep the mage alive from Ekkos quick burst damage and not put them into mortal peril. Ekko can also interact with the crown by simply hitting it once with an auto attack wait the duration out them re-engage the enemy to apply the pain. There are obviously more variables in a real game and it might not be the perfect example but the point should get across well enough Shieldbow is neither interactive at its crucial stages or interesting for either party to use or engage into.  With the current state of Shieldbow what is then the solution? For that i have no good ideas myself the only idea i can imagine is scrapping the item and taking it in a direction more akin to Crown where there is more possible player interaction available for the enemy while allowing the item to have more situational power/higher high so to speak. The point of this post was again to simply highlight the current ISSUES that shieldbow creates since everyone is split on Shieldbow either being useless/good/too good while what SHOULD be discussed is the current issues it creates in its current form and the possible solutions towards it. I would like to call it a necessary evil but in its current state it feels closer to pitfully petty outside of the few marksmen users mentioned earlier.  TLDR Shieldbow creates 3 issues in its current state 1st - Feeling lackluster on marksmen outside of those that have enough innate mobility/damage to not need other mythics. 2nd - Removing intended weaknesses from Yasuo/Yone too early in the game thus making them feel too oppresive/the window to shut them down before hitting their spike feels too brief. 3rd - It fails to be satisfying to use or play against while also lacking enough interaction early on for it to be healthy.  Feel free to post thoughts/ideas/your reasons for agreeing or disagreeing below ill try to answer any of them as best as i can.

rbacyz,hnnfuzu,hnnfuzu,"Shieldbow is neither the issue nor the solution to the lackluster feeling of marksmen, yet it manages to be BOTH problematic AND lackluster",U_Writing,12/07/2021,1,The problem lies on the fact the item update was clearly made thinking more on some champs than others  We all remember the first sunfire amumu or the Chemtech Udyr champions that became incredibly broken with 1 item to the point of being able to do incredibly high damage while negating most inate weaknesses they SHOULD have had then Riot nerfed either the item the champion or both at the same time to make sure it stopped  The core issue here isnt JUST shieldbow it is just what it is currently used but with the new item sistem it is just a matter of time untill something like Prowlers claw Garen becomes the new meta because it allows another champion that has a clear weakness to bypass them while giving them more than decent stats  The problems are that the new items are clearly not considered for ALL champions just the meta picks making it just a series of ticking timebombs for us to suffer
rbacyz,hnn9w0s,hnn9w0s,"Shieldbow is neither the issue nor the solution to the lackluster feeling of marksmen, yet it manages to be BOTH problematic AND lackluster",Odd_Play_5769,12/07/2021,-1,Its technically underloaded besides the shield offers really underwhelming stats for a class that needs them. Yes I understand the importance of the shield since jf youre dead you xant auto attack to use the stats Kraken and Galefoece give. But even that can be countered by positioning better.   The bigger issue is its use on melee champs. Yes I understand Yone and Yas want to opt into it because it has everything they want (attack speed crit QD lifesteal) but its too strong on them. Sterqks was always the shield item for melees why do they suddenly get two options?
rbacyz,hnn9aip,hnn9aip,"Shieldbow is neither the issue nor the solution to the lackluster feeling of marksmen, yet it manages to be BOTH problematic AND lackluster",tytyos,12/07/2021,6,The item is clearly overloaded fundamentally broken unbalanceable feast or famine conceptually flawed and obviously very lackluster
rbacyz,hnncfpc,hnncfpc,"Shieldbow is neither the issue nor the solution to the lackluster feeling of marksmen, yet it manages to be BOTH problematic AND lackluster",ruffydm1,12/07/2021,-1,I did not use toxic or unhealthy anywhere in my post and problematic was used once to refer to the situations the item creates not the item itself just in case you needed clarification for that. If you have any thoughts on the actual content itself id like to hear those too!
rbacyz,hnnkyd7,hnnkyd7,"Shieldbow is neither the issue nor the solution to the lackluster feeling of marksmen, yet it manages to be BOTH problematic AND lackluster",ruffydm1,12/07/2021,1,I very much agree with Shieldbow just being a symptom and not a cause of riots item design. I do mention how even with the failure the new item system have with shieldbow it does have an upside with the design of crown! Even if its currently overtuned and needed the nerfs the design and idea itself is far more elegant and interesting (i mentioned this in my post as well). It gives me hope that riot will reconsider remaking shieldbow into something is not only more satisfying while also not feeling oppresive on a select few champions.
rbacyz,hnnd8p9,hnnd8p9,"Shieldbow is neither the issue nor the solution to the lackluster feeling of marksmen, yet it manages to be BOTH problematic AND lackluster",ruffydm1,12/07/2021,1,Personally i would not consider an item that is 105% gold efficient not counting its passive while having an amazing build path as well as great mythic passive + good item components with noonquiver (NQ is seriously underrated for how good it is) to be underwhelming on its own BUT only on a few select champions. Id also be willing to argue Shieldbows build path is superior to Galeforce/kraken slayers build paths due to not needing to sit on the gold for pickaxe but rather being allowed to pick up a long sword into vamp scepter. A vampire scepter is usually worth more than a pickaxe in the lane phase thanks to the sustain after all!

I also outline this in my post that the situations it creates are problematic not the item itself hope the clarification helps!

With LDR being permacore 2nd item on basically every ADC the last passive stat you want to opt into is health since its basically nerfing the giant slayer (and cut down passive dmg for that matter) damage. Whereas %movement speed galeforce gives is great on all ADCs as is the stacking 10% passive attack speed.   I think shieldbow is more of an issue on melee champs not ranged.
rbacyz,hnnk005,hnnk005,"Shieldbow is neither the issue nor the solution to the lackluster feeling of marksmen, yet it manages to be BOTH problematic AND lackluster",ruffydm1,12/07/2021,2,Your last paragraph sums up what my 2nd issue with shieldbow is its problematic on melee champions while on average not feeling good on ranged champs unless you naturally have the DPS/mobility needed to pass up on Kraken/Galeforce even in situations where in THEORY you would love to have it.

You can join by yourself or you can join with your friends. If you join by yourself I will slot you into a random team. up to 2 subs if you want on your team  Unfortunately there wont be much for a prize pool but i will be able to give 20 dollars to each team member that wins the tournament but it will mostly be just for fun unless someone wants to pitch into the prize pool. will try to get more.  &#x200B  I will commentate all games on twitch and put them on youtube for later viewings.  Will usually have one guest commentator each game.  &#x200B  Again mostly just doing this because i thought it would be super fun and always wanted to try commentating (even though i prob sucks at it).  &#x200B  So if you are interested just comment your LOL name or discord name for me to add you to discuss if you want to join.  The league is in NA and will most likely be played on saturdays and sundays.  discord link is [https://discord.gg/Vz3RVRzyzy](https://discord.gg/Vz3RVRzyzy)  &#x200B  &#x200B  edit: if anyone has a good name for the league please do say. cant think of a good one at the moment. my first idea Challenjour League..  edit 2 extra idea: if we do make 10 teams and it becomes semi popular where other people want to join I want to make it a relegation system where the bottom 2 teams have to go to relegation tournament and battle it out to stay and let others have a chance to join..

R - blade of Zaun (finisher)(team fight sustain)(7 seconds duration): Sevika unsheathes an energy blade from her mechanic arm empowering her basic attack range and area of effect for a short duration. any target with shimmer hit heals Sevika and lowers the cooldown of her basic abilities.  &#x200B  Design with more of a dualist and jungler in mind Sevika specializes in one on one fights and ganks early game her abilities rely on good combo chaining with shimmer to secure the stun and deal some good damage. with little range early and only 1 engage ability engages have to be timed correctly or she could end up out of place with no way to retreat.   good counter against fast shooting ADC such as Cait and Jinx Sevikas weakness is crowd control and accurate ability combos when her passive has lower stacks. building tank will improve her passive but diminishes her performance in team fights. excellent players will use the most of blade of Zaun Shimmer Boost and Reckless endangerment combos to maximize stuns during team fights and sustain a good amount of damage.  excelling in jungling thanks to her passive Sevika can do well on a top lane. she has decent poke and good sustain in duels but few escapes make her engages make or break moments early on.

How would Viktor arcane fight in summoners rift hitting with a cane?

rb9brk,hnn0mqd,hnn0mqd,Why so many people want Viktor arcane skin?,ApplePitou,12/07/2021,0,I am wondering how they will show the transformation of Viktor into the Viktor we know today from game :3
rb9brk,hnoc8pj,hnoc8pj,Why so many people want Viktor arcane skin?,ChewNutz,12/07/2021,1,Because people think it’s unfair that everyone got an Arcane skin but Viktor forgetting that Heimer and Singed also don’t have skin. (Viktor is kinda part of the main character compared to those two though).  Beside it’s Riot and their skins. If they can make skull head thresh unbound hot with abs and all they could make arcane Viktor.

rb9a20,rb9a20,rb9a20,Original Champion idea,mosura5282,12/07/2021,0,I really liked the concept of Nagakabouros so I wanted to create a new champion that was related to her. I wanted to maintain a clear identity between the champion and Nagakabouros identity without it being too similar to Illaoi. In the end I came up with Ikmakoa who is a jungler who excels at ganking during the laning phase and disruption during teamfights. For me the flavor and concept of the abilities are more important than the numbers. Id love your feedback :)      Name: Ikmakoa     Title: The Serpent Son     Role: Jungle     Class: Tank (Vanguard)  &#x200B  >**Passive - Swift Serpent:** While in water (river puddles etc) \[x\] gains \[25+(3 per level)\] movement speed and \[2.5% of Max Health\] adaptive force. This decays on land.  &#x200B  >**Q - Idol of Motion:** An idol of Nagakabouros erupts from the ground at a set location and surrounds itself with water (450 radius). The water deals (5/10/15/20/25+2% Max Health) magic damage per second and slows enemies by 20%. Lasts 8 seconds.   >   >*Deals 100% increased damage to jungle monsters*   >   >Cooldown: 15 seconds  &#x200B  >**W - Spirit Blessing:** Passive: \[x\] has \[2/4/6/9/10%\] Omnivamp. Active: \[x\] blesses a nearby ally giving them his passive for \[4/5/6/8/9\] seconds. \[x\]’s omnivamp is doubled during the duration and the ally gains the Spirit Blessing passive. The blessing will end if either champion dies or there is too much distance between them.   >   >Cooldown: 30/28/24/20/18 seconds  &#x200B  >**E - Towards the Depths:** Ikmakoa summons a tentacle out of the ground that knocks any enemy champions caught in the radius into his auto attack range and does (5% Max Health Damage).   >   >Cooldown: 20/16/14/12/10  &#x200B  >**Curse of the Kraken:**    >   >**R - Wrath of Nagakabouros:** \[x\] surrenders himself to the spiritual power of Nagakabouros for \[15/20/25+0.5% Max Health\] seconds and grows in size. During this time he maintains his passive whether or not he is in water decreases damage taken by \[10/15/20%\] slows enemies around him by 10% and doubles the omnivamp of Spirit Blessing.   >   >Cooldown: 120/100/80
rb9a20,hnn3k4q,hnn3k4q,Original Champion idea,AlexDistr,12/07/2021,1,E needs a delay it sounds way too broken combined with his Qbut i love the champion design. Maybe less% damage cause this is something that usually gets nerf into the ground( see Lillia Amumu).  Edit: Also omvivamp is out of the question since riot basically eradicated it some patches ago.

When I went into the show she seemed like she was going to be characterized completely by her desire for wealth and power. I thought it was really interesting how they went into the fact that yes she does want these things and shes willing to manipulate people to get them but she does her best to do so in a way where she isnt hurting others like the way her mother does. She really was trying to do the best for Piltover and Zaun she just works to get things done in the way that she knows how. I really hope she ends up alright in the next season!

Dont answer that Ill loan you a copy. Now one of my favorites is Rule of Acquisition Number 3 never spend more on an acquisition than you need to.  &#x200B  See the moments before hot conflict is the best time for peace. Neither side is willing to make the first move and both sides fear bloodshed. But the moment just before either side pulls the trigger is when the price of peace is at an all time low. Cause both sides have everything to lose and very little to gain from fighting. And all deals after the first real shot will cost more since blood money needs to be added to the total.

rb8nex,rb8nex,rb8nex,How To Pick A Favorite Team?,oven4518,12/07/2021,0,Hi guys. Ive been playing League on and off for about 10 years now but I was never very interested in watching the competitive events. This year however I watched parts of the Worlds events and love it! I think because the production value is similar to the big North American sports. My problem is how do I pick a team to support? With physical sports I can just pick whichever team is geographically the closest to me. Cant do that here. How did you guys decide on your favorite team?  Edit: Follow up question how do you get more involved in following along with competitive league? It seems like there are just so many players and teams that its hard to follow!
rb8nex,hnmw9g9,hnmw9g9,How To Pick A Favorite Team?,jarredhtg,12/07/2021,2,C9 fan here so Im biased but heres my advice.  What do you like about an org? If you want drama and a community that screams and cries a lot TSM is for you  Like a team that spends huge money on proven players and delivers solid results. Look at TL   C9 has the best International results by far and a great atmosphere and community. They take chances on new talent and always come out big after losing the offseason  100T has a lot of great social media and merch and is an up and coming team  Want a team that makes you feel like you and your bronze friends could be good enough to do better. Maybe CLG and some antidepressants is for you  I would take a look at each teams social media and do some off season roster research. Podcasts like the Dive are good for this and then pick the one that feels right.
rb8nex,hnn01l2,hnn01l2,How To Pick A Favorite Team?,Plaxern,12/07/2021,2,Honestly I base the teams I support off of the individual players within them so if you have a favourite pro player just follow them and their team.  As for your last question I’m assuming you’re American so you’d primarily watch the LCS with hints of important matches of other regions(being CN/LPL KR/LCK EU/LEC).
rb8nex,hnmwq9n,hnmwq9n,How To Pick A Favorite Team?,Away-Eggplant9943,12/07/2021,1,I usually just pick whichever team has legacy or has players that I like to watch. TSM Liquid in NA. G2 and FNC in EU. SKT in KR RNG in CN  But really rosters change all the time and the teams are based geographically like in traditional sports(except for LPL teams) so I just root for the region. I like the LPL style of play so I usually just root for who ever is doing great in that league.
rb8nex,hnn0403,hnn0403,How To Pick A Favorite Team?,the_noblesteed,12/07/2021,1,just start watching and youll get attached to someone for some reason and thatll be your team. i got attached to clg a very long time ago and its been sad ever since but you know... sports
rb8nex,hnn3rhg,hnn3rhg,How To Pick A Favorite Team?,Odd_Play_5769,12/07/2021,1,Watch the games and pick whichever team you click with. Since there arent regions or cities the teams are from that you can identify with this is the only option.
rb8nex,hnnqg4e,hnnqg4e,How To Pick A Favorite Team?,springpowered,12/07/2021,1,Teams change pretty heavily from year to year so most people end up being fans of certain players as opposed to teams. However there are some pretty interesting storylines this year surrounding some teams.  If you’re normally a fan of teams that are the biggest and best Team Liquid is one to root for. With the return of legendary mid laner Bjergsen from retirement and the signing of EU bot laner Hans Sama they have a lot of proven players who are going to be very exciting to watch. They’ve got a really strong roster full of worlds tier players and are expected to be the strongest team coming into the season right now.  Another really strong org is 100 Thieves. 100T is the current reigning champion having won the 2021 summer split. At worlds they went 3-3 in their group and failed to make it out but were against the team that became world champions and the team that was arguably the 3rd best in the world. They’re the only team that’s running back the same roster from last year with the addition of a rookie top laner in Tenacity who is going to be splitting time with veteran Ssumday. They have a fun team dynamic in their content too which is always nice. If you want a solid team that’s likely to go top 3 and could challenge for the top spot I think 100T is a good bet.  If you’re more a fan of rookies who are still establishing themselves but still want to to root for a team that’s likely to do well I think Evil Geniuses is a good team. With last years Rookie of the Year in the bot lane in Danny and one of the most exciting NA rookies of the year in Jojopyun you’ll be sure to see an exciting team that is sure to develop as the year goes on. Their veteran players Impact Vulcan and Inspired are all seen as some of the strongest in their roles in NA. If you want a team that’s currently 4th-5th that’s going to be fighting for a top 3 spot this is your team.  Finally if you’re a real fan of underdogs I don’t think you can go better than Counter Logic Gaming. CLG as an org used to be one of the best in NA but has struggled in recent years. They’ve placed 9th or 10th in the past 7 splits. However this year they’ve started a clean slate. They’ve completely replaced their coaching staff with coaches acquired from Golden Guardians Academy and are focusing on rookie talent this year. With a set of fresh players who have mostly only had brief stints in the LCS before they’re going to try to prove themselves as rising talent.   If there are any other teams you’re curious about I can say any storyline surrounding them but I think these 4 have the most compelling ones right now.
rb8nex,hnmxp90,hnmxp90,How To Pick A Favorite Team?,oven4518,12/07/2021,2,I thought all teams were based out of Los Angeles technically?
rb8nex,hnn853g,hnn853g,How To Pick A Favorite Team?,Away-Eggplant9943,12/07/2021,1,The ones in NA yes. Thats why its whack. They should be based in different states like traditional sports so that why teams have a home team rooting for them

rb8isr,hnmuxub,hnmuxub,This game's community is sick,Hertzagobeanja,12/07/2021,3,The mute button will be your best friend. At the first sign of toxicity BAM! muted. Heck sometimes I know it’s coming so I mute all to start. I’m autofilled jungle? Mute all and do my best. Having a bad matchup in lane and getting camped? Better quickly mute all and focus up.  The worst part about the toxicity is it feeds itself. Someone has a bad game and they get flamed. It’s not motivating. At best it’s distracting and only ever results in more poor plays from the player on the receiving end—which in turn causes more flaming from toxic players.

At the end of the day this is a fast paced game and not really the ideal way to make friends or meaningful human interaction.

This is why a lot of players beg in comments to use the mute function because if you do it then you can actually enjoy this game.   Some season ago I was defending myself from those raging kids but now I dont even let have more than 2 lines into my chat. If they show only a small sign of raging they get muted for chatting and pinging and dont get unmuted until the end of the game. Its too cringe for me to know that Im an adult with a degree a good job business meetings with people from outer countries and in my free time I go barking in chat with a kid who can barely hold a mouse in his hand.  Im saving my nerves for my kids not wasting them with someones else kids.
rb8isr,hnn2xtz,hnn2xtz,This game's community is sick,Naymliss,12/07/2021,2,Yeah great you can mute them but they still were assholes and youre still stuck in a potentially hour long game with them where you have to help said asshole win. It sucks a ton of fun from the game especially if its happened multiple times in a sitting and especially if youre not in a great mood.  Muting helps but its not the end all be all to completely solve toxicity.

There’s an issue it’s hurting people now the immediate solution is to mute chat if you can’t handle it. “Just be a good person 5head” isn’t going to help anyone it’s not a solution nor is it a replacement for muting it’s just an admonishment of something that actually works. The op didn’t say “how can we as a community combat toxicity in a long term fashion” they said “I’m hurting because of toxicity right now.”

rb8isr,hno61jx,hno61jx,This game's community is sick,Equal_Damage6694,12/07/2021,4,ill agree muting works as a band-aid solution i play without chat on. however the true solution is to stop using the mute function as an excuse to downplay the negativity in the community. you shouldnt have to play a video game and just handle the toxicity it makes absolutely no fucking sense. i know many people have become numb to the toxicity in the game and thats good on them. either way just mute lol or deal with it is an awful solution.  maybe its a bad take but i think players should be heavily penalized for toxicity in any form. at the end of the day were talking about a video game here there is never a reason to verbally abuse somebody over a video game. call me sensitive if youd like. but maybe if more people stop enabling and excusing being shitty less people would be shitty.
rb8isr,hnodvzt,hnodvzt,This game's community is sick,MadCapMad,12/07/2021,1,nice strawman but this comment section doesnt have any way to heavily punish toxicity in game and that certainly wont be achieved with or just be a good person   &#x200B  Theyre on reddit. Youre on reddit. We dont advise rito we advise the people that come to us for help. If op wants to not have the issue of toxic chat their best solution is mute chat not or just be a good person. Its like youre trying to make your initial stance a lot bigger or more rational than it is because someone called you on how weak and pointless Just be a good person is as a statement in this context.
rb8isr,hnofcah,hnofcah,This game's community is sick,Equal_Damage6694,12/07/2021,0,idk man it seems like youre arguing with me just to argue.  you dont have to agree with me but im sure most would agree that toxicity is a real problem that should be addressed with a real solution.  if you are toxic in a video game you are probably just an angry person who feels small. be better.

rb8fm5,hnq97bj,hnq97bj,I'd like to talk about aesthetic design in champions as of late.,AdvanceHandball,12/08/2021,1,>Primarily because Im bored.  Im bored of posts about fucking monster champs. For all your bitching Riot knows most people dont give a shit about them. May as well ask Ford to start making cars with 5 wheels because you like the look of them.
rb8fm5,hnoulm8,hnoulm8,I'd like to talk about aesthetic design in champions as of late.,aglimmerof,12/08/2021,-2,Akshan was created by Jeevun ‘Riot Jag’ Sidhu who self-identifies as an Indian. He was created shortly after Jeevun took over from Mark Yetter.  A Gary Stu champion who saves the day looking handsome and perfect who happens to be Indian and _happens_ to be introduced just when an Indian man _happens_ to become Head of the gameplay team.  Before anyone cries racism. It’s not racism to point out the blatant slant towards the Lead Designer’s personal bias. Mark Yetter would never have pulled this nonsense and made a self-insert champ.
rb8fm5,rb8fm5,rb8fm5,I'd like to talk about aesthetic design in champions as of late.,ralanr,12/07/2021,0,Yes this is about monsters.  Primarily because Im bored.  Back when Iverns teaser was first revealed there was a couple of posts on the league of legends forum (rip) that had this picture saying itd be this guy. If you cant see a picture (because Im terrible at pictures with Reddit) then imagine an old man druid under a hood wielding green energy as nature magic.  Now people are gonna speculate. I remember a whole lot of crazy ideas with Kindreds teases. But at the time many people pointed out that the design was too generic for League. And they were right as Ivern was incredibly unique in leagues design even when we already had another tree person. Ivern looked like he belonged in League of Legends.  I dont get that feeling anymore with new champion aesthetics.  This goes beyond the overwhelming amount of humans we have over monsters (Arguably the last real monster champion we got that wasnt a rework was Ornn). Akshan and Viego for example dont feel like they belong in Runeterra. Now Viego if you dig deep enough actually has a solid foundation and a great twist on the concept of love.  But then we got Bollywood Akshan who just feels like hes there to look pretty and swing. I could make a very tiresome argument about how awful the ruination event was but the key thing I want to bring up is that Akshans only role in that event was to shoot Isolde and use the magic powers of his resurrection gun. He existed to end an event and while there is a story about him trying to avenge his master it just feels like Riot doesnt want to make much use of him. At least to me.  Now what else do we have? Well Aphelios Seraphine Rell Sett Qiyana Sett Senna Samira Yone Lilia Sylas Yuumi Kaisa Sylas Gwen etc. And its not like these characters all dont fit in Runeterra. But the designs just scream to be a bit basic or only focus on an attraction element.  I get the argument that monster champions dont sell well because they have niche kits but theres a problem with that argument.  1. Riot makes those kits niche. Riot designs these champions from the get-go. Maybe if they designed a monster champion with a non-niche kit that champion might get played more. 2. Humans with niche kits arent played more just because they are human. Look at Rell what is she a 2% playrate? What about Singed Kayle or Lilia? These are champions with niche playstyles and builds but they arent all monsters. They just have niche kits.  So what sort of argument is it that monsters are niche when in reality its the gameplay themselves that are niche? Isnt Khazix kind of popular? Rengar was for a while before his rework. Those are monsters!  What bothers me about league is that I used to be really excited about new champions because of not just their kits but also their design and the story they could tell. I mean Braum was basically marketed as a folklore legend of the Freljord. Braums not even a monster but hes cool as heck because of the character built around him.  I dont really get that with a lot of new champions. Vex is the first non-human weve had in a while a yordle to boot! Frankly if it wasnt for the ruination being handled as it was Id like her more. But when I see more characters like Akshan Sett Aphelios etc etc over and over I just stop being interested.  And Im just one person. I know my voice isnt enough to change Riots design philosophy and I know plenty of people like having the characters as they are. Hell I remember a lot of people fighting back about having a more diverse cast of female champions since up until Illaoi (and still sort of after) all league ladies were basically using the same model.  League of Legends aesthetic used to be a lot more interesting than it is now. And its getting worse. Heck even the skinlines are getting pretty bland by shoving demons or eldritch horror into the gimmick. Whats next? Putting Angels in the pool party skin-line?  [Seriously I feel like this could be Ivern if he was released now. ](https://preview.redd.it/s1r4pa3ei6481.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=554db3498e631af2d1f5e49e6c0a66b3dfacedce)

The champion does way too much dmg it doesnt matter if youre 3/0 with 2k gold lead if tahm gets on top of you he will kill you with a doran shield and no you cant kill him because his E will save him from any all in you want to pull off the only way to win this lane is if he is extremely bad and takes 30 bad trades.     I know Riot hates top lane but who actually enjoys playing against this creature he has been S+ tier for months now just remove his w and give him something less aids it legit ruins my day every time I have to lane against him.

Riot only does their job balancing top lane when people comment about it enough. Im glad people are commenting. Ive seen 2 posts today so far about TK and its a good thing.
rb854s,hnn7fcg,hnn7fcg,Why is Tahm Kench not nerfed still?,Ill-Discussion3408,12/07/2021,4,I mean i know any resistance to your idea as you stated means that im coping or in deniel which btw is a really good way to make yourself believe you are correct all the time. By saying if you disagree your just wrong.. Thats a smart brain trick. But anyways i only lose to him when using immobile bruisers like mord garen and sett   Anyone else he falls behind against minus a few straggler weird to place champs like singed and teemo.  Ornn Udyr urgot  kayle shaco sion fiora kassadin katarina jhin diana nocturn xinzhoa i have yet to have an issue vrs a kench when using them.. Also having shield nullifocation just upsets his kite too much and makes him weaker then most tanks . i have more issues with kassadin and quinn then i do with tahm
rb854s,hnmsjr5,hnmsjr5,Why is Tahm Kench not nerfed still?,milyziom,12/07/2021,2,tahm is lane bully. he is supposed to be annoying but simple counter is to trade him with poke skills. so that he is forced to back and lose shield or to force his shield and not gain hp back. qss is hard counter same for antiheal tahm hates bursts.  every champion is broken if you cant find his counter
rb854s,hnn3u2v,hnn3u2v,Why is Tahm Kench not nerfed still?,Aeiou-Senpai,12/07/2021,0,Probably same reason why camille still has chogath R on her Q.
rb854s,hnmym2j,hnmym2j,Why is Tahm Kench not nerfed still?,4arhus,12/07/2021,1,I do agree on the fact that Tahm is hard to lane against (and really easy to play) he will outrade and outfarm you. Your only job is to not fall to far behind try not to give him to much kills. Back base often if needed thats not a problem. If you have CC and your jungler gank keep it for when he try to W out.  If youre not buried under the map you will be much more useful in the game after. If he is ahead just split push forcing him to chose between be useful for his team or losing objectives bounties.  Or ban him.

rb854s,hnmti9j,hnmti9j,Why is Tahm Kench not nerfed still?,LordRaruma,12/07/2021,0,Thing is he doesnt really a have a counter per se I know how to lane against him but you cant tell me the champion isnt broken you have to afk for 15 mins and praying to god enemy jungler doesnt dive you and all of this wouldnt be a problem if   1. he didnt have a gap closer which makes you unable to walk past your side of the lane without dying 2. his ultimate not requiring any stacks to use  You cant play the lane  its boring 0 skill and by the time he falls off the game is over. Ask any challenger top laner theyll tell you he is broken dont try to make arguments for a champion that is by definition overpowered.

rb854s,hnnw24o,hnnw24o,Why is Tahm Kench not nerfed still?,throwawaynumber116,12/07/2021,4,I’ll wait until someone calmly explains why he’s allowed to do more damage and tank more and heal then the literal juggernauts for the entirety of lane as a fucking tank.
rb854s,hnn29zu,hnn29zu,Why is Tahm Kench not nerfed still?,LordRaruma,12/07/2021,6,I dont think you understand how top works eventually the wave will push back into him and when it does if you dont crash it he will freeze for a long ass time the w hitting you isnt the problem the problem is hes cutting off your escape and then eats you and then sits on top of you and qs you and then you die . It would all be fine and dandy if the lane bully didnt have an insane gap closer and hard point and click cc followed up by guaranteed q slow and even if you have flash he can just hold his q.

Although Trappers bow gives you hp+damage on hit it would feel really lackluster compared to Quiver. This is because the way runes are you can cheese quiver with going tank support and just running font of life + revitalize which would proc the passive and give almost the same amount of healing. Mercy Rifle seems okay at best? I dont really know how i feel about this one since support can just go glacial and provide a longer slow but it may be useful in some matchups?

I think g2 shalke spring playoffs made clear how that happened (jinx were against a sion volibear Tham trio that together with a seraphine heal could tank for days not allowing her to activated her passive).

rb7z7m,rb7z7m,rb7z7m,Ideas for making ADCs fun to play during laning phase.,No_Procedure_9951,12/07/2021,118,Ive been watching a lot about the design of ADCs and I genuinely think the ADC Mythics were a step in the right direction - but theyre still mid/late game focused items. Shieldbow accomplishes anti-burst and sustain Galeforce accomplishes mobility and execution and Kraken Slayer has ended the reign of terror tanks have had on ADCs for so long.  ADCs pre-mythic just feel bad however. As to compensate I have ideas for some starter items that could fix their issues.  &#x200B  **Quiver of Vitality** (450 Gp)  (+7 AD +100 HP)  Unique Passive - Rush-Down (When you receive healing or shielding from an allied champion benefit from a 12% attack speed bonus for (4 seconds)) (15 second cooldown)  &#x200B  **Trapper’s Bow** (450gp)  (+5 AD +8% attack speed)  Unique Passive - Engage Judgement (When you attack an immobilized target (stun root knockup etc.) heal for 25 hp and gain a bonus 8 AD for the next 4 seconds) (15 second cooldown)  &#x200B  **Mercy Rifle** (450gp)  (+10 AD +60 HP)  Unique Passive - Waffling (When you deal damage through auto attacks to an enemy that has taken damage from an allied champion within 1.5 seconds apply a 20% movement speed slow for 0.75 seconds to the target (15 second cooldown))  &#x200B  *Only ranged champions should be able to purchase these items and upon purchasing one should not be able to buy anymore (since buying all 3 with a support like thresh or lux would be unfair).*  *Yes I did name the passives off of what I want them to do/cause the enemy to do yes I find it funny.*  &#x200B  For those interested Im going to rant about the design theory behind these items.  There are three main classes of supports - enchanters engage supports and carry supports. Of course these theoretical items correlate to the three classes of supports - The Quiver of Vitality for enchanters Trappers Bow for engage supports and the Mercy Rifle for carry supports. While it is possible to use these items when paired with supports of a different classification or hybrid classifications such as Pyke they are most effective paired with their respective support.  The Quiver of Vitality is activated by any healing/shielding from external sources meaning it is literally useless alongside allies that dont have healing/shielding. The attack speed amp is meant to be used by the types of adcs that are strongest with enchanters (typically on-hit or crit adcs like vayne kogmaw jinx etc). These adcs build lethal tempo or PTA and are usually as strong as their attack speed. This also incentivizes for ADCs playing alongside enchanters to be much less passive immediately using their new buffs to engage in order to maximize the benefits theyve gained. While it can be used alongside champions like thresh or taric who provide engage and healing/shielding it doesnt synergize as well with those engage champions as Trappers Bow on average because Trappers Bow provides both AD amp and healing. Im no expert in the math but the 12% attack speed was specifically chosen to match a single dagger which effectively means that you have an item advantage in strength whenever this passive is activated equal to a single dagger which can seriously make or break a fight in the early game but doesnt have broken scaling.  Trappers Bow is probably the one that someone would look at and go but mages or but jungle camping and while thats true its effectiveness stems from the cooldown. I put down all three items as a 15 second activation cooldown because I wanted these passives to be activated frequently but not spammable. I think Trappers Bow offers a large collection of effective uses in lane. If your Blitz lands a hook and it isnt enough for a kill early thats fine the AD amp means your follow-up will be extra effective and the healing means that any counter-attacks will be nullified. Often in bot lane if the enemy laners are strong enough they can straight up ignore the engage support and just burst the ADC if theyre too close or not paying attention so this bonus healing allows an ADC more of a reason to fight. Same idea as Quiver of Vitality - you get more stats aka a temporary item advantage against your opponent if you decide to all in. Curiously however you can just take the healing and go. If thresh qs but doesnt recast if blitz lands q or even if your lux hits q it allows you to follow up with quick poke and retreat - it forces ADCs to want to follow up while mitigating the negatives that come with doing so while also rewarding them for helping at least a little on a bad engage so that they can compensate for their supports mistakes more easily. It also uses healing rather than shielding because the benefit for a small poke should be effective - a shield implies the immediate need to always engage which could be unhealthy and leaves ADCs with less options.   Mercy Rifle is a worse Stormrazor. The Stormrazor meta was honestly really fun for ADCs and gave them the tools to engage and kite more easily in a way they never had before but it was so strong it was nerfed into oblivion. This starter item hopes to revitalize that concept without making it too strong. The slow is small and has a short duration but again is activated quite often. This is meant to work with carry supports like Pyke Senna and Brand and exists to make landing burst cc more easily available while also offering chase-down and kiting against champions as a follow up to your allys damage. The slow can be used to allow you and/or your support to run away or engage right after a burst. While an allied support may burn all of their abilities on a burst combo the slow buys time for their cooldowns to come online and gives you an opening to peel damage as much as you can - potentially enough to score a kill. Its not that good with typical engage tanks because compared to the value of Quiver of Vitality the slow is just overkill cc. This item seeks to give the same advantage Ashe has when paired with carry supports but less - and the follow up has to be quite immediate as well with a 1.5 second window since the last damage instance (which could be extended by scorch/other DOT sources and lead to really interesting synergies!).   &#x200B  Also note that none of the bonuses on these items should have scaling whatsoever - selling them is still necessary because eventually they will fall off in favor of more powerful items.  Now the obvious - these accomplish the same things that Imperial Mandate Moonstone Ardent Censer and other support items wish to accomplish. I mean Quiver of Vitality is just a worst Sanctify (Ardent Censer) minus the magic damage on-hit. But thats exactly the point. By the time the ADC and Support have their mythics theyre accomplishing these things but before then the early game is sluggish and boring. These items dont seek to solve the exact problems of these support items and instead reward an ADC for building just a tiny bit around their support. It forces follow up - be it just small poke or a full hard engage while also punishing early-game engage less and making early game adc games more proactive. They arent strong enough to beat out all scaling ADCs because scaling ADCs can just disengage with the immediate benefits of these items while allowing the more aggressive ADCs to utilize the full duration of their buffs respectively. It forces synergy through itemization in the early game without sacrificing any archetypal benefits of ADC or supports.  Any stats or numbers are free to change as long as the principals of these items remain. I dont think their synergies with ADC mythics will make them too powerful as long as the numbers arent too high. They synergize really well with the ADC mythics and actually incentivize ADCs to learn how to work alongside their supports and make synergies because their strength depends on it - Vayne would want enchanters even more now that she gets the 12% attack speed buff when shes healed/shielded for example. This also breaks the incentive for playing ADCs in off-roles and could potentially bring back the ADC class entirely IMO.  Let me know what yall think. I believe that ADCs require less punishment early on and higher incentive for in-lane peel without making them broken and I believe that the small passive benefits from these items cover that. While it does bring forth a conversation about giving other champions more dynamic starter items thats a conversation for another day.

It’s not like these are going to make adcs any more powerful early game. It just adds a bit of extra engagement and also makes each game a bit different as your starting item now depends on who your support is. Pretty cool ideas!
rb7z7m,hnnhrw6,hnnhrw6,Ideas for making ADCs fun to play during laning phase.,CanonicalPizza,12/07/2021,12,I like these ideas! Definitely more exciting than the choice of dblade long sword or *gasp* cull which practically have the same play style with some consideration for your runes. I think the magnitude of the effects would be better scaled down (ie less attack speed longer cool down etc ) because unfortunately these turn the lane 100% into SUP DIFF which I would hate (for instance if one support land a root but the other misses it it’s a free kill.) I think supports would also dislike how snowbally this could be off one missed skill shot.

rb7z7m,hno21f5,hno21f5,Ideas for making ADCs fun to play during laning phase.,daswef2,12/07/2021,39,>because adcs is a… mid/late role  Interestingly a good deal of marksmen have winrates that peak early and then trend downwards throughout the game (most interestingly this includes Jinx who Ive always thought of as a lategame powerhouse).  Even given that most marksmen are facing other marksmen theres only a few marksmen that have winrate graphs that have their highest winrate point in lategame.  Personally I dont think entire classes should be viewed through an identical power curve.  Jhin Vayne (sorta her winrate dips hyper late) Kaisa Miss Fortune Aphelios Samira Senna are the ones that have an upward trend curve and have their highest strength point in late game.  So thats about a third of the class but the whole class cannot be a lategame role because it is almost always being matched.  So if I play Senna and you play Jinx you should probably be trying to close out the game against me very quickly.

However these champions at least have added benefits to sitting back and farming for 20 minutes outside of the normal gold every champion gets. While ADCs have always had a reputation for being strongest in the late-game these items dont hope to even make ADCs that much stronger just more engaging during laning phase when playing alongside their supports. Even if youre still not dishing out unbelievable damage getting rewarded for small amounts of peel could make the role feel more fulfilling to play.
rb7z7m,hnn7nrv,hnn7nrv,Ideas for making ADCs fun to play during laning phase.,WeirdgeName,12/07/2021,-2,Right but by making it so every adc item gives 20% crit they also reduced ad across the board by a huge amount which wasn’t necessary at all.

rb7z7m,hnnojvy,hnnojvy,Ideas for making ADCs fun to play during laning phase.,CorruptedArcher,12/07/2021,2,I was hoping it would be more like a noon quiver  like Item that adds a little spice in the early but immediately loses its effect when upgraded to mythic. So there is some skill and build diversity when fighting in lane but doesnt shake up the over all identity of an ADC. I find that building noon quiver for added minion damage is so pointless and adds no real incentive to build the item other than working towards mythic.

rb7z7m,hnof078,hnof078,Ideas for making ADCs fun to play during laning phase.,GabrielNV,12/07/2021,43,ADCs are considered late-game oriented because of math. Other classes scale linearly with a single stat (AD or AP) while ADCs scale cubically with AD+AS+Crit. x³ increases much faster than x as x increases.   You can check this in practice tool by comparing the DPS of a lvl 1 no item ADC to the DPS of a lvl 18 full build one and doing the same for any other class. I guarantee that ADCs will (on average) have the highest relative increase of all.   The fact that there are 2 ADCs opposing each other essentially every game is exactly why we cant rely on winrate over gametime curves when comparing overall ADC scaling to other classes.    It is true that not all ADCs scale equally and some will peak earlier than others. Its also true that damage isnt everything and range/mobility/utility can also influence relative power in different ways as the game progresses. But in comparison to all other classes it is fair to say that ADCs peak mid-late and thats when the ADC player has more influence over the outcome of the game.
rb7z7m,hnodxp8,hnodxp8,Ideas for making ADCs fun to play during laning phase.,ThyPrasiolite,12/07/2021,7,I think that its rather that this give a little bit too much power in the early game and more than that giving the 15 second cooldowns would make the lane much more of a stomp fest than what it was. Also this items in general really dont give more agency to the ADC but to their supports.   In no way this would help make ADCs a more fun role early but itd make it a bigger stompfest to whichever support is setting the pace. Also early game ADCs would probably be fucked over by this change HARD.

However these champions at least have added benefits to sitting back and farming for 20 minutes outside of the normal gold every champion gets.  Its literally nothing else than numbers like ratios. Nasus has flat bonus. ADC spike with crit.  Anyway its not even worth it to scale into ultra lategame because of his kiteable nature which is why are adcs supposed to be that OP. They position well and kill you before you make it to them or dont make it to them at all. Also adcs arent really that weak they are stupidly OP at right hands and not super disadvantageous situation. Its just that most adcs get viped even before they manage to do  something but when they survive they go toe to toe with other classes very easily.

Also what WR means is how well Yone is doing in meta now how strong he is. Also... Well this is felacy but the more you think about it the more it makes sense and that is that Yone makes its just all players being bad kind of argument sound not so silly. He does attract certain type of players that just go rambo and then die a lot for no reason.
rb7n8f,hnpspyh,hnpspyh,"The Design of ShadowFlame does not full fill ""Anti-Shields"" For Mages.",uvPooF,12/08/2021,1,Why does Shadowflame need to be Anti-shield? I buy is as anti-squishy item as it is strongest pure dmg 2nd item for burst AP carries. The fact that magic pen is at full value vs shield is just a small bonus to ensure that this burst playstyle isnt totally countered by shields.
rb7n8f,hnpwdl2,hnpwdl2,"The Design of ShadowFlame does not full fill ""Anti-Shields"" For Mages.",fabton12,12/08/2021,1,The reason it doesnt feel like anti shield item is because it isnt one in a traditional sense its meant tobe a anti shielding item only vs squishies. its meant to allow mages to gain maxium burst against a target if there shielded.   its not for all types of mages either since its built to support burst characters in those situation where shields are the strongest. They cant make it just like serpents because then most mages would get it every game to mass aoe apply it to everyone making it stupidly op compared to serpents which most assasins struggle to apply to more then one at a time.
rb7n8f,rb7n8f,rb7n8f,"The Design of ShadowFlame does not full fill ""Anti-Shields"" For Mages.",DRtedybear,12/07/2021,4,I am a mid player I find mages to be the most fun for me like Azir Seraphine Syndra Cassiopeia Etc. With this new preseason mage items got a bit of an overhaul. Cosmic drive had a bit of a rework same with Seraphs Embrace. New items like Crown of the Shattered Queen and Shadowflame. I believe the changes helped with some of the gaps mages had but for me Shadowflame really missed the mark on anti-shield.  Anti shield was brought in with Serpents Fang. This item had a bit of a history with changes but has stayed as an ad lethality anti shield item reducing shields by 50% for melee and 35% for ranged. I want to talk about serpents fang as the design philosophy also will be accounted for for mages. The item benefits for melee champions much more with 50% rather than 35% as they have less opportunity to apply this rather than ranged champions. Khazix for example can not apply this as much or as easily as an adc like Caitlyn or Miss fortune so nerfing the effectiveness for ranged is neccesary. To add to that it is a lethality item so getting it stunts the build path for adcs. So with this it heavily reduces the effectiveness of ranged ad champions as balance.   For serpents fang I brought up the less effectiveness for ranged champions but more for melee. However if you look at ap melee champions such as Rumble Diana they can damage a group of champions a lot easier than an assasin like Khazix or Rengar.   With Serpents fang it was designed for ad champions. Ad champions usually rely more on attacks or short cooldowns of an ability rather than Aoe which is what mages are about. A Caitlyn Draven cant apply damage an area of champions that easily. Ad champions with Aoe like Miss fortune Xayah Aphelios they have abilities or ultimates that do this but not as reliably like an Azir Syndra Brand Malzahar it goes on.     As stated if mages had an anti shield it would be much more powerful on them rather than ad champions so Riot created Shadowflame which deals with shields differently. From the lol wiki it reads   Dealing magic damage to champions ignores 10 − 20 (based on targets **current** health) of their magic resistance increased to **maximum** value if the they were affected by a shield within the last 5 seconds. So you get flat pen based on current health or when affected by a shield.  As a mage player what bothers me is this has not become an anti shield item but rather a damage/ burst item. For some examples an enchanter on an adc this will be helpful. Against bruisers or tanks not really. Getting void staff would be much more beneficial in those situations making the item just for burst or magic pen.   I find it less useful than void staff against a tank with Fimbulwinter. Or champions like Riven Sion Tahm Mordekaiser. If I were to change it either have it as reducing shields by a percentage or reducing the targets magic ressistance in general.  I would like to say one more thing. The item is useful on Adcs with an enchanter or shieldbow. It is good in those situations making it a viable item. I find it missing the mark on an Anti-Shield and more into a burst mage item.  &#x200B  TlDR   Shield pen is easy for ranged not melee so ranged needs to be weaker.  Shadowflame misses the mark on an anti shield item more for burst mages. It is anti shield on adcs with enchanters or shieldbow. Unhelpful on bruisers or tanks with a lot of hp and MR.
rb7n8f,hnmoq8c,hnmoq8c,"The Design of ShadowFlame does not full fill ""Anti-Shields"" For Mages.",LTKokoro,12/07/2021,3,shadowflame just needs the exact same passive as serpents have instead of the pen. With shadowflame + ludens/rocketbelt + sorcs flat pen is just too easily stackable. I dont think currently anyone builds shadowflame as anti shield item its just bought for overall pen
rb7n8f,hnmqdj6,hnmqdj6,"The Design of ShadowFlame does not full fill ""Anti-Shields"" For Mages.",Naymliss,12/07/2021,-1,Good. Explicitly anti-shield items like Serpents Fang are unhealthy for the game and are cop-out solutions to balancing items and champions in their game.   Also champions like Brand being able to build an anti-shield item would literally make some champions useless because of how long they can re-apply it and how easily they can do so. I get that there are some champion/item combinations that feel horrible to play into because of the shields but this... isnt the solution.
rb7n8f,hnn4zw4,hnn4zw4,"The Design of ShadowFlame does not full fill ""Anti-Shields"" For Mages.",Odd_Play_5769,12/07/2021,3,I agree. Only balancing difficulty around a Shadow flame with Serpants % shield break is its synergy with AP DOT champs like Brand or Lillia or Singed who could abuse it but you could qdjust % ratios for DOT abilities

rb7l23,rb7l23,rb7l23,Champ diversity for who got skins this year was disappointing,EROTIC_RAID_BOSS,12/07/2021,11,At the start of the year riot set a goal for itself of shipping 140 skins this year. If you include prestige skins they did pretty much hit that goal and it was pretty close even without prestige skins  But because out of the 130 skins we did get around 20 of them are champs that had already gotten a skin this year we have about 40 champions this year who didnt get a single thing. 140 skins 150something champs only 108 champs actually got a skin this year. Does this annoy anyone else?   Now I wouldnt be bothered if we had a guarantee that everyone will get one by midway through 22 if the idea is to hit every champ within 1.5 years. But we havent gotten a guarantee like that AND instead of getting pretty much every champion they instead gave 2 or even 3 skins to a ton of champs in just 1 year.    It seems totally ridiculous and its hugely disappointing after finding out theyd ramped up the skins they were making every year because I think a lot of us assumed we wouldnt have to go hungry for so long anymore.   &#x200B  &#x200B  Also its pretty insane that weve gone past 2 years without an ezreal skin now.

Why? Most of them already have good modern legendary skins to boot its not like were talking Brolaf were talking Galaxy Slayer Zed. Theres so many champions out there who have clunky af animations due to age and could really use one legendary skin instead like Leblanc.  And yeah besides legendary skins its still ridiculous how some champions will get 3 skins within a single year surely one of them could have gone to someone else and most wouldnt even complain.

Seems like too high a number if you ask me especially with leona getting 2 regular skins a prestige skin and a team skin. or yone getting both a legendary skin and a regular skin. or cait getting a second legendary and a total refresh on her entire skins catalog.

rb72g8,hnpfbtu,hnpfbtu,Patch 11.24 notes,Soul-Collector,12/08/2021,1,The arcane voicelines are gone now right? I cant find it in the patch notes.
rb72g8,hnpgrv2,hnpgrv2,Patch 11.24 notes,redditlolacc1991,12/08/2021,1,Instead of buffing split pushers like its been done with Jax and Fiora what Rito can to incentivize split push strategy are some macro changes:  1. Lower the buff power of Baron and Elder Dragon. For split pushing to be effective the benefits of taking an objective elsewhere on the map cant be that great.  For Baron definitely remove:  a. the Empowered Recall so that there is less of homeguarding coming in.  b. 50% HP+mana refund upon recall. Currently its useless except for stopping a split pusher more easily.  c. possibility to have Baron empowered minions in multiple lanes at once. It will actually prevent the team with Baron to send the most useless teammates to hug the turret and thus render the split pusher useless as the waveclear becomes too slow.  2. Increase the tankiness of Baron+Elder so that there are extra few seconds to get that turret/inhib.  3. Remove AP conversion to damaging turrets by mages that way Veigar and Ryze wont be able to get turrets just as fast as dedicated split pushers what is that shit even?  4. Buff turret damage. They still feel like a breeze to a tanky target and split pushers will still be able to take them down just as fast. What this macro change would do is increase the risk for the enemy team diving 5v4 while the split pusher is doing his job.  5. Given that the global rewards from turrets have been nerfed make it so that there is extra global gold if only one person takes the turret down. If you think about it split pushers are usually the ones that take turrets solo so there would be an opportunity to contribute to your team while not grouping. On that note since split push strategy is a team effort that requires warding and pressuring other parts of the map even global XP is a justified reward I dont know why it was removed it had been there since the beginning of time.  6. Make it so that Futures Market allows for gold sharing (donations) so that split-pushers with excess gold can actually reward their teammate(s) for the team effort that this strategy requires. Moreover once full build split-pushers gold keeps piling up with no way of making use of it this addition would remedy that. Of course make this feature limited just like the debt amount currently is.
rb72g8,hnph3l2,hnph3l2,Patch 11.24 notes,Antergaton,12/08/2021,1,These ARAM changes are awful. Yorick has like a 1% playrate in an it meaning those playing him want to play him he has a high win because those people are probably good on him.  Jhin is picked 15% of the time and a similar winrate no changes.  And Ziggs is now legit a minion and they just nerfed Tank Mao again.

Half the champion changes are just works with Lethal Tempo now and theyre calling it buffs (seriously who the fuck would ever play Urgot with LT?). No notable changes at all to the bullshit that is Chemtech everything tanks had their single patch of having a good item so its getting gutted same with a keystone they like. Axiom Arc still not deleted.   And the Cait changes after teasing something interesting to make up for the lost mechanics are literally a slap in Sabers face.

You dont need to play the game to balance it or remember what your champions do as long as you have 200+ collective years of design experience in your team as evidenced here by how in touch with the game state balance team is.

Because the AP buff lasts for a total of 4.5 sec after taking dmg. That is more than enough time for a melee to kill someone.  For a ranged champ the 4.5 sec duration or 1.5 sec wouldnt change too much. Maybe make it last 0.5 sec after the buff is gone so 2 sec total after taking dmg.
rb72g8,hnpwnuo,hnpwnuo,Patch 11.24 notes,ADeadMansName,12/08/2021,0,Pls no oracles back. Makes everything so one sided. Either enemies are too stupid to buy it or they do buy it and Teemo is useless.  Oracles was terrible. The current solution isnt great but a tiny bit better.

rb72g8,hnp8195,hnp8195,Patch 11.24 notes,Phoenixness,12/08/2021,2,you say that like any of the other changes have actually done anything. there is still no fix for assassins with massive damage buffs and less damage taken there is no fix for the literal 4 champs that get fucked over by early game cannon minion trap reveals (shaco teemo jhin and nidalee) or are just completely oppressive when you have to chase them down a lane. axiom arc. duskblade invisibility. ziggs has a tower execute where there is only 2 towers between the start of the game and super minions. just to name a few.  I want to put in the time and effort to make up a big list of changes needed for Aram but I feel like it would just get ignored.  oh to add to the fuckery this patch they gave ryze extra shielding. he hasnt had a self shield since s9 as others have pointed out.  also I think the map could really benefit from an update (dont get me started on map bugs). If they made it very slightly skinnier but had alcoves broken up along the length it would really freshen up the experience. chasing people around alcoves in SR is never not entertaining.
rb72g8,hnpud1h,hnpud1h,Patch 11.24 notes,ADeadMansName,12/08/2021,1,But it is exactly how it should be in the end. They removed the hardest abuse cases made it easier to use and more consistent. This is what should happen to Riven too.

rb72g8,hnpx26r,hnpx26r,Patch 11.24 notes,CohnDev,12/08/2021,1,I kind of agree but I think its because they wanted to nerf the Melee % the same amount they buffed the Ranged %. Thats not a good reason but 75% of this patch is trash so Riot clearly doesnt really care about reasoning.

rb72g8,hnq1sfg,hnq1sfg,Patch 11.24 notes,ADeadMansName,12/08/2021,2,The item is actually way better than reddit and Riot give it credit for.  It is as good as old Seraphs for Anivia as a 2nd item (unbuffed for 3k gold). Anivia or Seraphs will get nerfed most likely because of the -400g.  Ryzes best 2nd item aside from OP Cosmic. Not as good as old Seraphs but it also opened up direct buffs to him. Now he will likely not get direct buffs till Seraphs gets nerfed.  For Cassio Seraphs 3rd is nearly a mist have after Cosmic. Now Seraphs 2nd will be a must have just because of the Cosmic nerf and the Seraphs buff.  Veigar should hate new Seraphs but it was already decent on him before the buffs. Now it could become his 2nd item aside form DC.  Lux with Seraphs was totally fine. Not great but decent. Maybe could beat the other optinos now.  Viktors best 2nd snowball item is lichbane but Seraphs will be close or maybe better as a general item even.  &#x200B  Overall it looks like every ranged mage was already doing decent with Seraphs and all it needed was a slight buff (1% AAS and 1.5-1.6% Seraphs for the AH conversion).  Instead Riot made it OP as hell and now every mana mage with range and every mana champ who can get away with tear early should be building it.

Overall Crown has a few problems:  1. dmg reduction duration is actually decently long with 1.5 sec. You are pretty much immune to ability dmg for 1.5 sec (25% dmg taken reduced by Armor/MR is nothing for what the enemy pays in CD/mana). Get this down to 1 sec 2. The duration of the AP buff is way too long. 4.5 sec is huge. Make it 2 sec in total.

rb72g8,hnptc4z,hnptc4z,Patch 11.24 notes,ADeadMansName,12/08/2021,1,I can see them reverting it to 3k gold and just give it 1% and 1.6% AH conversion. The item was way way better than Riot and the community seems to think. Its WR on champs it synergizes with is nearly fine to great which means it was slightly lacking.  Many champs you dont want to use it still did nearly ok with it.  Veigar for example doesnt want it yet it loses to Shadowflame by just 1% WR and to only Cosmic drive and DC a lot. If they buffed it a little bit even someone like Veigar could use it.  But now with -400g and Cosmic nerfed decently hard Veigar might decide between Seraphs vs DC. And that means Seraphs is for sure not balanced when one of your worst users wants to buy it over all the other options.

Lucian wont because of how fast he can proc PTA. Miss Fortune probably still is PTA/Comet. Trist rather have HOB to get her bomb off the early game but she can consider LT. KaiSa also goes HOB but idk about LT on her. Jhin is always a weird ADC but hes never going to play a rune that takes 6 AAs to proc its full effect. Samira probably is going to stick to Conq. Also Senna is not to proc it fast enough but shes in a weird limbo of... first strike or Grasp weirdly since GA got changed. Twitch also usually dont go for LT unless he has like a Lulu usually going PTA. Ezreal also is... well Ezreal.  I think crit Xayah actually rather have old Lethal tempo. Same with Kalista (but she does like HOB) and crit Sivir. They will still go LT but idk if youre going to see a crit Sivir anytime soon due to ER being the way it is.  That leaves Jinx Cait (if not going Fleet) Kog Aphelios (alternative of Conq tho) Ashe Varus (not lethality and not going HOB) Vayne (or just PTA) crit Xayah and crit Sivir.

His dmg drops decently hard and he can still jump around a lot and be hard to kill but he will take a lot more dmg because he has to do 2 rotations instead of 1 for most kills.  Fimbul is great if you are stomping early already and your dmg is enough anyways.  But aside from that Seraphs was already stronger in general and that while being slightly weak.

Some of the interactions are simply wrong or interact strangely. Like for example Yoricks %movement speed boosts not applying to Ghouls. Is that a bug? Or is it an intended interaction? If its intended why it even intended? What could possibly break the champions kit by enabling him to run Ghost and actually have his pets keep up with his movement speed instead of outrunning them?  Or what about his Mist Walkers not getting the next level worth of attack speed when Yorick levels up? Their health or attack speed doesnt update dynamically - but his attack damage does. Is that a bug or intended?  Or how about the Maiden of the Mist benefitting from Lifesteal? Is that intentional or a bug? If its not a bug why is it intended that the maiden benefits from lifesteal?  Lastly what about Mist Walkers applying spell effects like red smite the rune cheap shot ravenous hydra or other similar effects? Are these intended interactions? If its not intended why is it special cased that Yorick doesnt benefit from these interactions?  I really dont like your suggestion that a lot just simply arent bugs because it comes across as an excuse for the Yorick players having to put up with half of his kits shortcomings and issues.  Sorry that this comes across poorly but you guys are plenty fine accepting him the way he is when in reality were dealing with brand new bugs like Mist Walkers drawing minion aggro double maidens conqueror bug still not fixed maiden will walk down weird paths when released and youre acting like its all been analysed and determined all is good.

Ziggs could hit q 100 times dealing 100 damage each time that gets regenned and it would out damage say qiyana who fights less frequently but oneshots. Which is more useful? Qiyana’s damage is concentrated and better in a vacuum but ziggs is the more useful champion because outside of the vacuum he wins the game off a single tower push.

So if you buy deadman’s plate they will get the flat movement speed that builds up. What they wont get though is the 5% movement speed boost inside the item itself.  That’s why it’s so jank. You can build flat ms boosts and get them on your pets like black cleaver and stridebreaker granting flat movement speed but the second you pick ghost or take celerity or gain home guards your movement speed can stack up to being too high.  Your mist walkers will only gain flat ms boosts while they’re within a certain range of you once you exit that range they lose any shared movement speed bonuses. That’s why you can out run your pets because once you get too far from them they lose anything you were providing them.   I don’t know about other summons for other champions though.

rb72g8,hnoxb03,hnoxb03,Patch 11.24 notes,Lors2001,12/08/2021,1,At the end of the day though the game does cater to casual players idk how you can deny that. Your skill as an individual play matters signficantly less in HoTS as its more team based. This isnt even talking about how the balance of the game was probably one of the worst out there but just in the core design of the game it was more team based than any moba out there.   If my skill on a champion doesnt allow me to snowball and carry my team then my skill means signficantly less. Instead of being able to be signficantly better and snowball carry 1v5 you can only be better skillwise and consistently win 1v1s however being massively or slightly better than the other player doesnt matter much as the end result is pretty much always the same you win 1v1s and lose 2v1s.   Now theortically what this means is that team skill is valued more and how you express skill. However this means nothing if you arent playing in a 5 queue with friends as youre just rolling the dice with your teammates everytime. Also since the game focused around objectives even more than a game like LoL theortically they could make it so macro skill meant more however since you could traverse the whole map in like 10 seconds with your mount this isnt really true either.   Make a game team focused where your individual skill matters pretty little the balance is one the worst Ive seen from a multiplayer game and have very little skill expression outside of just learning how to play your character and the best builds and youre going to attract a casual audience not that thats necessarily a bad thing.

If youre maxing out an ability for the soul reason of killing towers a little faster while sacrificing poke damage and wave clear both of which are what makes Ziggs good in ARAM then youre trolling youre literally nerfing yourself just to get the chance to kill a tower slightly faster.

Enchanters like Sona/Nami/Janna are the most top tier champs as well as bruisers and they have no changes just because people build meme pure AP/AD builds on these champs. The only reason they probably caught Lux is that her winrate is being skewed by people who still somehow struggle to play against poke from a perma-exhausted Ziggs lmfao but now Luxs best ARAM build i.e. shield bot is being nerfed.  It also shows in the Ashe change - all this will do is push her towards Mandate build even more because you were already griefing if you built Ashe ADC - now even more so.

rb72g8,hnn54e2,hnn54e2,Patch 11.24 notes,Blue_Seraph,12/07/2021,6,Knocking 400g off of Archangels is a cop out and the item is still likely to keep underperforming on anyone not named Kassadin. Simply because knocking 400g off the item doesnt make tear stack faster and even at the 3000g price point it was usually finished slightly before tear finished stacking if purchased 2nd.  &#x200B  The only thing that does ( granted its not nothing ) is accelerating your 3rd item 400g.  Instead of reducing the items price the sustain should have been given a way to scale outside of the Kassadin-exclusive healing cap and the bonus AH ***might*** have deserved a slight buff.

rb72g8,hnmvu4n,hnmvu4n,Patch 11.24 notes,Yonsi,12/07/2021,22,Maybe. I think of it as being akin to the Divine Surrender nerf on Ezreal taking it from being oppressive to  generally okay. Locket has always felt underwhelming so just having an item that properly works out of the gate feels a lot better. The fact that it still spreads to enemies too will still make it a solid pickup especially for its core users.

rb72g8,hno3oyi,hno3oyi,Patch 11.24 notes,mrpeanut332,12/07/2021,1,It’s really not needed. Engage supports when it comes to win rates aren’t even that good 6 of the top 10 winrate supports plat plus are enchanters and one of the ones there blitzcrank is only there because he counters enchanters. Maybe nerfing it by 1-1.5 seems reasonable I guess but 3% seems pretty weird. Also I know winrates aren’t everything but even when it comes to pick rate a lot of enchanters are dominating it feels weird to see engage supports get nerfed idk maybe I’m wrong but that’s just my opinion I guess.

Id like to be rewarded for knowing how to poke enemy champions by placing my abilities correctly.  The mindless tower poke from his passive/W can be toned down so he doesnt take towers as quickly and give gold to his teammates and waveclear get hit so the enemy takes towers more quickly.  Im also pretty convinced Ziggs is just hard to make very bad decisions on like assassins or bruisers so you dont exactly throw games away on him which is one aspect of why his win rate is higher.

rb72g8,hnmq4rl,hnmq4rl,Patch 11.24 notes,lVIEMORIES,12/07/2021,33,Assuming you rush a Titanic hydra and get it at level 9 the change means that youre missing 16 AD from the hydra passive while the on hit damage is increased by a miniscule amount.   Assuming then you finish your sunfire aegis by level 12 then youre missing about 34 dps from the burn when you have aegis fully stacked and double burning.  This also affects the amount of shielding you get from stoneplate. And of course as the game goes on the worse the nerfs will be due to Skaarls scaling health.

Like how about you buff the other items instead of nerfing the two you forced us to pick every game.   Just let me survive and be a nuisance. I dont care about killing people. I care about being a brick wall that allows my team to kill people.    I have heard the argument that tanks need damage to shove waves and I agree. However it is completely acceptable to increase or decrease damage dealt to minions or monsters for many champions... Do the same for tanks and let me be threatening via CC and durability. If I wanted to do damage I would pick a carry.    I completely agree with all the complaints about tanks killing carries in one rotation. That shouldnt happen. They also shouldnt die having to run away after one rotation though.    Making tanks more survivable at the cost of damage fixes the majority of the complaints I see here too. It directly increases the relevance of marksmen. It decreases the presence of assassins. It extends fights and possibly increases game length.    All of the above doesnt matter though because China needs their dopamine hit with 20 minutes of one shot kills. Fuck everyone else. Fuck the desire to be survivable without drain tanking via conqueror/goredrinker/shieldbow/streaks/triumph/lifeline/ravenous hunter/divine sunderer. Fuck item diversity.

rb72g8,hnneynk,hnneynk,Patch 11.24 notes,DuudPuerfectuh,12/07/2021,1,They nerfed the burn to compensate for the new damage effect but then they nerf the new damage to the point its not really a buff and more like a true shift of damage.  The thing is for a lot of champs the item is nerfed cause the burn effect is now weaker on waveclear and in someone like Urgot he lost burn damage that now its shiftef into a new damage that is already halved cause hes a ranged champ.  TLDR frostfire is objectively worse now because the damage only got shifted but the waveclear got noticeably nerfed and on ranged champs its a joke.

The amount of game breaking bugs I can remember is like 10 in a decade and those were pretty much all situational and required forcing (eg switching autos to ults global skill dmg on eg poppy q). Riot have surprisingly (considering the size and complexity of the game) done a really good job with QA. But its such a popular game that a lot of smaller bugs do get the spotlight.

rb72g8,hno6cg0,hno6cg0,Patch 11.24 notes,WiatrowskiBe,12/07/2021,3,They have QA they just simply cant test everything in house - League is a huge game.  League generally runs on a 2-week patch cycle which more or less means that - for every patch - QA has to test all the changes that were made for that patch in terms of functionality (if changed stuff still works) and correctness (if change matches what was supposed to be changed) verify if nothing in the game breaks to a point that would cause crashes or required version reverts (I dont recall a single League patch revert). Only after that key part of QA there might be time/resources to do some sort of shotgun-testing trying to look through the game and find out bugs that arent obvious on first sight find out how to reproduce them reliably and pass to engineers.  Now League is *pretty* complex game (just look through wiki) knowing all intended exact interactions by a single person is borderline impossible and even if you take small fraction of those interactions - theres even larger amount of combinations that can happen in games youd have to test against to detect those kinds of bugs in house. Note that those Talon bugs are very specific - requiring multiple things to be set up exactly right in order to happen. For QA - finding those bugs during routine tests is almost impossible for playerbase as a whole - it happens all the time due to sheer amount of games played.  This is why Riot (and every software developer really) always asks for precise reproduction steps - so it can be passed to QA in a way that lets them reproduce the issue test it further to determine what is probably actual cause triage (decide if and how urgently it should be fixed given time required and risk of introducing new bugs) and then pass it to engineering in order to get a fix.  For better context of how large and complicated (for testing) League is due to sheer amount of possible interactions - my guess (as software engineer) when it comes to amount of QA work needed to comprehensively test and document **all** in-game interactions (on a single patch) - and thats without fixing anything - would be approximately 8-digits number of man-hours (thats several thousands people working on it for few years) assuming all testers are trained QA that also happen to be League experts and Im probably underestimating the effort needed.

It essentially turns games into 4.5v5s when theres a shaco teemo twitch eve (etc) on defense.   What separates a good team from a great team is knowing to take down the tank minion/super minion ASAP. Its honestly not even worth it to play these Champs in aram anymore. I still play shaco every chance I get though hes too much fun.

Jayce and Varus have longer range poke but they dont have the wave clear MF is OP regardless of playstyle Brand has relatively short range which makes him hard to play against long range comps etc. Without the debuff Ziggs can just endlessly waveclear and stall the game by himself imo the only proper way to nerf him is to nerf his minion dmg.

The real advantage of Frostfire is the lower cost. Sunfire cost and build path sucks for every tank who isnt winning his lane already.  I agree that Frostfire needed a dmg nerf but this makes it the worst of the 3 tank items easily. Sunfire is snowball only Chemtank is niche and frostfire is the worst it has ever been now.

Pink wards will reveal them but because there are no bushes any pink placed is totally exposed and easily cleared.

Aram is supposed to be non-competitive and bans efficiently removing a handful of champs isnt the answer considering that many players enjoy playing as these champions too.  Not saying some champs arent unbalanced on the mode but agree that bans -> permabanning the same champs isnt the right answer.  Unpopular personal opinion - I think so many players Ive seen in aram just refuse to go in when its evident that our team comp is not going to outpoke theirs. So many games where the team just sits under tower and tries to early ff instead of just trying to engage and survive through mid-late where tanks and bruisers win hard.

Main reason these champions winrates are so high is because most of the players dont wanna play boring champs (tanks/engage champs/bruisers) theyd rather play a damage champ and carry the game.

I dont see demonic embrace on that lolalytics page but its kind of crucial when going Fimbulwinter because of its passive. Furthermore Fimbulwinter should be paired with Everfrost because the active procs the shield.   I also wonder how many people dont go Everfrost but Fimbulwinter which should further reduce the efficiency of Fimbulwinter.    With the correct build Fimbulwinter Kass reaches 4k HP ~3.5k Mana and about 600AP. Mejas and Gathering storm pops that up to about 700 AP.   So you got a Kassadin that has   4k HP 3.5k Mana ~650 AP A fat shield every 5 seconds  Im sure that build if built correctly is superior to Seraphs.

You dont get 10 times the processing power with 100 engineers than 10 really good employees. But you most certainly do pay 10 times as much for those diminishing returns.  One guy fixes a problem his way and now another fix that was going to be implemented somewhere else no longer interacts how it was supposed to in the first place. The trigger changed. So 1 guy wasted his week/month not getting his fix approved. So 2 engineers solved 2 problems but only 1 can be made live. The QA teams job needs to be indentifying the problems replicating them and seeing what parts of the code affect the problem. And then split the work between its team. For effective communication the team cannot be too large so that they all know how theyll try for a fix so that it wont effect the next guy along

Its just that I couldnt possibly play her that way when she is nerfed that hard. All these nerfs do is force her further into the mandate build.

I think you are overreacting to the ashe nerf. Shes just as viable as an adc as she was before this patch (which is to say 90% of the time you are trolling if you dont go mandate poke). ADC ashe is harder to play and much more team dependent (you would really like to have frontline/enchanters). Maybe if they moved her to -30% damage then it would start to be relevant as you would be forced to play utility focused builds.

You are not always allowed to go for that W R. You will be cc locked / die before you even get in range.

It doesnt help her to push at all nor does it help her deal damage either since her damage comes from hitting headshots. Fleet Footwork is much better in lane.

rb72g8,hno8frn,hno8frn,Patch 11.24 notes,T-280_SCV,12/07/2021,0,My analogy wasn’t intended to be about money input. Moreso about Blizzard not treating the game & it’s community properly and the fact that it isn’t dead yet.  > Its a failure because its a moba catering to casuals  I usually see this phrasing trotted out against shared/team xp or the lack of cs’ing. To such I reply that are other avenues of skill expression in a moba than trying to 1v9 carry or farming creeps.   There are some changes that have been made to simplify the game (merc camp timers) provide more visual indication (xp globes) or cause less variance in player experience (stealth changes). Given similar changes in League (jungle timers and vfx updates) I feel that HotS has been quite reasonable.  > It would have been a massive financial loss for blizzard if they really tried to drag it into the limelight  It would’ve but I disagree with your reasoning. The other mobas grew their esports scenes organically and became successes. Blizzard was trying to force HotS along the same path by throwing money at it (a frequently used method to attempt solution in NA).   Shoving someone to get them to move faster *may* work but they’re liable to turn around and punch you.  > When there is so little to learn in the game  Yes so *little* to learn.   * 90 heroes (QWE) some of whom have active traits (D) unique movement abilities (Z) or extra baseline active abilities (1-6).  * Each hero has at least 2 Heroic ability (R) options at 10th level 3 talents per regular talent tier (1471316) and 2-3 Storm-tier talents (lvl 20) on average. Pretty sure that adds up to more than LoL’s item shop even after pulling out the assorted shit picks scattered about the roster (ie Genji’s Pathfinder lvl 1 talent).  > you can have 20 different maps on a random playlist for your game  Spoken as if this *isn’t* more to learn.  * Each map has its own objective mechanic. This ranges from pushes-lanes-with-you such as webweavers on Tomb of the Spider Queen to bosses like Battlefield of Eternity’s Immortals or direct structure damage on Hanamura.  * Then there’s the map-specific mechanics which range in magnitude from Volskaya’s conveyor belts to the generals on Alterac Pass. The generals are closer to boss fights and heal  out-of-combat back door attempts there are all or nothing because chip damage doesn’t stick.   * Mercenary camps are shared among themed maps(hellbat pairs and goliath/raven squads on Starcraft maps) but they vary between themes (siege giants on non-universe maps). Timing of mercenary camps vs objectives is another detail to manage.  * Last but certainly not least is how these all weave together alongside the map itself. Corridors and choke points vs open space influence the strength of zoning heroes and poke comps terrain contour shapes the use and strength of wall-interacting abilities bush placement is intertwined with vision control due to very few equivalents to wards.  > Which means the game is fun in short bursts but it isnt anywhere near as rewarding as LoL DoTA or even Smite after the 500th game.  I had nearly 500 games on Kel’thuzad alone last I checked I’m still having a blast.  This is a matter of personal taste happy you have other games you enjoy.  > Cant say I know anyone that has played Hots consistently for its lifespan but I can certainly say that for most other mobas.  I found out about HotS & started playing around Stukov’s release. I’ve only stopped playing due to computer issues where I was incapable of running it on my computer or in protest (a few months following the HGC fiasco and as part of a reddit-community show of solidarity during the Acti-Blizz walkout earlier this year).

What it does make a strong case for is picking it up third item since thats usually more flexible + you start running into item slot issues.

Also its probably similar to Cosmic Drive on mages due to game states where you dont need a specific second item to deal with the enemy team mean that you can buy this incredibly efficient item that doesnt have a specific use case besides casting more spells.  That being said chopping 400 off definitely puts it closer to those other support items where a 300 bonus gold luxury item might be less greedy and more of a general good pick.

I just get salty whenever people try to downplay poke/range comps by saying the counterplay is just to engage on them.

Though I really dont see it being better than SoFW or Ardent. A lot of Sonas power is in how efficiently she keeps a lot of those buffs up and since she doesnt build a mana mythic new Seraphs isnt gonna give her that much AH to work with.

But look at Old Liandrys and Rylais they were strong together. But lets say that Liandrys was picked 15% of the time and had a 54% vs Ludens 55% which was picked 60% of the time. But Rylais was picked in 5 of those 15% of games and it had a 58% WR vs 52% without it. Liandrys is a better item then Ludens but because people arent building well it looks like it is worse just from the raw WR stats.

Its all within margin of error though. But its worth noting I havent seen a single known Sona main rush Archangels even in preseaaon. I think the conclusion is still the same. If there are multiple sources of AP on your team Staff is better rushed midgame to enable them. Otherwise its Archangels now that its a lot more affordable or chemtech if they have dedicated healing (yuumi soraka etc).

rb6tm9,rb6tm9,rb6tm9,How widespread is smurfing really?,bearseamen,12/07/2021,1,So I played LoL about a decade ago religiously. Now I feel the urge to get back. Im old and really bad at the game. My Rank is Bronze I and I probably dont deserve to be much higher.      However in almost all my games there are people *obviously* smurfing. Im coming back from a game with a 20/2/2 Irelia with 5 lifetime games total under her belt.      Please tell me whether Im just having a streak of bad luck or if Bronze just is this way - cause if it is Ill be uninstalling faster than I can miss CS.  I just want to play against players of my level. Matches are too long to be entirely for nothing.
rb6tm9,hnmjy1i,hnmjy1i,How widespread is smurfing really?,KARMAWHORING_SHITBAY,12/07/2021,6,If you haven’t played in a really long time you usually get placed with smurfs for your first 10-20 games because the system isn’t sure if you’ve retained your old skill or not so it wil place you with other questionable players. After a few losses though it will balance out and you’ll get mostly players of your skill
rb6tm9,hnmkn5c,hnmkn5c,How widespread is smurfing really?,KeeBoley,12/07/2021,2,Tons of smurfs exist but they are spotted by the smurf-detect system pretty early on. If they are performing significantly better than their rank suggests they will be put in a smurf queue. And tbh the system is REALLY good at detecting smurfs. Very few actually good smurfs who are trying will make it past the system.  The real problem atm is false positives where a player who is not a smurf will get labelled as one and will have to lose a couple games in smurf queue before the system takes them out. This is mostly a problem with players who take long brakes and decay but still have high MMR.   Overall all these problems are solved with high amount of games played. If you play enough games as sample size the system will place you properly.   We cant really determine if these players are smurfing without seeing the games. Its possible they are just popping off because in that elo players are so coinflippy. Either 20/2 or 2/20. But assuming they actually are smurfing this will be because youre coming back after a break and are being labelled a smurf yourself. The solution is to play more games for the system to readjust your MMR.
rb6tm9,hnmlmeu,hnmlmeu,How widespread is smurfing really?,shaidyn,12/07/2021,2,So a couple of things.  1) Smurfing is pretty common but its super common right now because were in preseason. People are playing on alts to fuck around so they dont mess up MMR on their main account.  2) In bronze things are swingy. People play coinflip champions and all in constantly so a really shit irelia might go 20 and 2 just because they won their first two fights and nobody knows how to shut them down.  3) The enemy team and your team have equal opportunities to have smurfs on them. But over 5 or 10 games those stats dont really feel helpful so you just gotta grind out your games.  4) You might have better luck creating a new account and learning to play on it before you come back to your main. Its a lot easier to place high on a new account at the start of the season than it is to drag an old account out of bronze.

Im already quite sure that the root of the problem is centered around ap/ad abilities and itemization. even if mages/ad assasins have the same game influence - the outcome of there performance is minor for pros. they basically pick only cc and aoe centered champions which helps a team overall. like they dont aim towards bursting or 1v1 anymore at all. which is bad considering how thrilling for the viewers those things were back in the days.

The job an ADC has is to deal dps. Surviving and dealing dps for a long duration of time during a teamfight.   Even if the ADC is an item or two behind the normal amount at that stage of the game you can still play the role perfectly and perform your duties of surviving and dealing dps even if that dps is lower than perfect.  Assassin has only one duty which is to kill the key member(s) of the enemy team. If theyre too behind to perform that task theyre completely useless as the nature of assassins isnt suited for dps or surviving.

I get it they were the golden child could do no wrong for like 9 seasons and I am 100% with you that they should be garbage when behind. But at the same time being even or slightly ahead as an ADC and having to run away from the 1/6 Zed who can one shot you with just Ult + Duskblade and one or two more autos while missing every Q/E is kind of absurd.  Lethality scaling with levels means that no matter what they will always be able to kill the ADC because of how shared XP works in bot lane.  I have watched it happen to just about every pro/challenger ADC I can find and I know its also an issue in lower elo but something has to change.  I think that Riot either needs to adjust the way XP works for bot or adjust the lethality values so we dont have another season of AD bruiser/assassin mids that leave lane 0/0/0 and one shot my ADC because they left nexus.  I am open to other solutions but I think ADC is arguably not in a great spot right now supports have all the agency in lane and if you dont get giga-fed from them spoon-feeding you kills during laning phase you cant really walk up at all during teamfights.  Shieldbow helps alleviate the issue a little bit but the cooldown is far too long compared to the average rotation assassins have at their disposal.  Just some food for thought I would be curious to see if Riot has noticed something that either supports my claims or completely undermines them.

They also need to be able to one shot or severely chunk tanks/bruisers split push and 1v1 well and have zoning potential to be considered useful. I really dont think its healthy for the expectation of a useful assassin to be the ability to destroy tanky characters. Kinda defeats the purpose dont you think?

But then... assasins are in the same boat providing only damage and yet they get to be good even behind because they get huge amounts of mobility and or utility (akalis crazy mobility duskblades super stealth etc) all while still having enough burst damage that they can build like a bruiser and still assassinate the squishy.

ADC can be strong. ADC can be weak. Either way the same problem exists: ADC as a role has 0 agency. Riot has skewed way too far on the glass cannon mentality for them and it has become more and more of a problem as damage in the game scales up.  It used to be the ADC had no agency but they were strong. You protected them they wiped the enemy team for you. Nowadays though odds are your ADC is dead before they know a fight has begun because of damage auras or a 1/6 zed or something.  Part of this problem is the botlane XP. But if Riot fixes that for ADCs supports are going to 1v9 every game because support is already strong. I honestly dont see much of a solution aside from Riot re-doing the 2018 mid season patch that killed marksmen in bot. Do it in pre-season let it be the state for the season and use that year to re-work the class (particularly crit ADCs) in a more healthy way.  Yes that might (probably will) mean losing power for the ADCs. And yes it will mean some go to other lanes. But it is better for the long term health of the game rather than a class being shoe horned into one spot and the game having to be balanced around that.

I legitimately dont understand how Riot believed assassins were struggling. Theyve sucked assassins collective cock for ages because theyre the most fun kind of champion to play. Most assassin mains are just looking to snowball off a few kills anyway so why not actually punish them if they dont get that? Dont just keep removing their fucking weaknesses with shit like Axiom Arc or Eclipse or Edge of Night. Let assassins be counterable! Actually give them weaknesses!

Its flash/zhonyas or death when it comes to counterplay and when you look to reengage after surviving they already dashed halfway through the river to the other lane.  There needs to be some spacing in their combos or one shotting changed to two shotting with lower cds.

rb6r4e,hnml9ad,hnml9ad,"If ADCs are going to be near useless when behind, assassins should be too.",Himbler12,12/07/2021,122,ADC has been a problem to balance for awhile but this pre-season really has shown how bad its gotten - damage is just too high. Like way too high for everything. Shieldbow is basically a necessity in this meta and even then you can only fight an assassin when its up off cooldown.  They need to remove damage from the game namely by removing lethality items that assassins build. They really dont have to pick any other itemization up - they get enough health and shields through lethality that they dont even need to pick up defensives. The same goes for magic pen in this preseason theres like 5 items to pick up that can burn through a squishies base mpen that you can pick up in the first 10 mins of the game.  ADCs either need to be able to do more damage when you get in range of them or make it so that you dont just get exploded whenever youre in range of literally any other role. Supports are more fearsome than ADCs lately because of their burst potential with penetration.  I agree though it seems like AD is an afterthought and it really shouldnt be the only skill expression role that has to play perfectly or lose.

A good place to start if they wanna buff adc items would be making crit items give 25% crit chance again so we can buy a defensive item if we build when 100% crit and boots. I dont wanna have to give up basically all defensive options just to guarentee that random chance wont cause me to lose.

rb6r4e,hnnih1x,hnnih1x,"If ADCs are going to be near useless when behind, assassins should be too.",mmat7,12/07/2021,51,THATS what I hate about current league  used to be that you NEEDED ADCs late to deal with serious damage they were the AD CARRY. Sure you were weaker early on but it would pay off later when youd have highest damage in the game and at like 3 items + boots they couldnt just run into you blindly and walk away with half their health  Now? Now no one cares about ADCs because they are weaker at every single stage of the game and are at best even with other roles in late. if Im 3/0 and a zed is 1/3 he can EASILY kill me without hitting any spell but if Im 1/3 on ADC and enemy jungle/top/support buys tabis Im suddenly UNABLE(and Im not saying its hard im saying you are literlaly unable) to kill them up until like 3-4 items in  No wonder vayne is so popular when she is realistically one of the only AD carries that can deal with being jumped on AND actually does damage

Tanks > Assassins/burst mages> ADCs/battlemages> By battlemages I mean the short range spammy types a la Cassiopeia Azir Ryze etc.  Reduce the shared lane XP penalty reduce the absurd healing that bruisers/AD assassins have and give adcs the tools (armor pen/shred ramping damage or %hp) to kill tanks. Probably need to be in their kit to keep divers from hijacking the items and using them better. It would be harder to solo carry but at it gives each position a more defined role/agency.

But a 1/6 Zed doesnt kill you with just R+2 autos and Duskblade  Even a 10/0 Zed cant do that his ult by itself without the return damage that you get by hitting abilities doesnt deal that much dmg its actually laughably low.  So your example is quite a bit exaggerated.  Plus ADCs have the possibility to just farm at at some point they will become useful no matter what because almost all of them have good to amazing scaling.  And as an AP Assassins player i can tell you that unless youre playing Katarina any other AP Assassin becomes basically a cannon minion once they fall behind.

Also do you know how zed ult works? Zeds ult doesnt do damage on its own it only reapplies a % damage during the duration. A 1/6 zed doesnt one shot anyone unless he hits a triple shuriken and even then I doubt it.  Assassins when behind (khazix rengar Zed blue kayn) are by and large useless except for some utility assassins just like adcs.  Edit to add some more spice: I will gift a 1350 skin of a players choice to any zed who manages to one shot an adc of equivalent level with shield bow without hitting any qs in a regular ranked competitive match with a standard lethality build.

Like its just the standard now that ADCs dies if you get on top of them and everyone can get on top of ADCs. Its a fucking joke ADC streamers are dying out for a good reason. No one wants to play this shit fucking role anymore its in the worst state ever since 8.11 and reflects in pro play as well. You have to build full offense otherwise you do no damage and this means you die in one shot to everyone including supports. I thought ADCs were supposed to be sustained DPS which means that defense is mandatory. You need to stay alive to do DPS time in the fight is a function when calculating DPS so ADCs should have defensive items. Its like that in every other MOBA except League for some fucking reason where we just get deleted by a 0/10 Zed who missed all his Qs.

Also who do ADCs counter? oh yeah they counter tanks the class that is picked in 1 of every 10 games.

Ive pretty much just started playing different mages Brand especially works well with any supports that help you get your passive off. You do way more damage than an ADC early game and even if you dont manage to snowball or get shit on. Youre still more useful by default. A 2 item brand can deal 1500 damage in a team fight with just his ult. A two item Adc is lucky to do 500 damage to a single target before they get one-shot again. Seriously unless youre duoing with your support just pick brand.

I try to go for Galeforce to potentially get out of reach of the assassin at the moment i get allind. Assassin builds prowlers claw and gapcloses to me anyway even if i use Galeforce + Flash. I go for Shieldbow to try and live through the burst (which is almost impossible unless you also outplay them with dodging skills or a well timed flash). Assassin builds Serpents fang and my item is rendered way less useful. There are also 0 armor items other than Ninja tabi that can be built as an adc unless you are Kogmaw.  Against mages i can go shieldbow into wits end and actually have a very meaningful way of surviving their damage because they cant counter my items as effectively and fast. (they need shadowflame AND void staff)  Also Serrated Dirk is a ridiculous powerspike. Its the only reason why every single Zed Qiyana or Talon snowball into oblivion especially when they play jungle. They full clear buy Dirk and deal absurd damage at lvl6.
rb6r4e,hnnpn9u,hnnpn9u,"If ADCs are going to be near useless when behind, assassins should be too.",ieatcheesecakes,12/07/2021,5,Nah the issue with adc isn’t that they get one shot or suck to play with from behind. Cause an ahead ad and supp will auto win any teamfight and rotate to each lane to shred the outer. A behind ad has at least the comfort of knowing they scale and can still carry teamfights at 3 items.  The issue with adc is that they don’t actually get to have agency over if they come out of lane ahead or not. The laning phase is like 70% dependent on the support 20% jungle and 10% themselves.   Imo the early game power from supports should be gutted which is largely an effect of runes.   As for jungle well that role just has way too much map impact

As to your point of the cooldown is far too long compared to the average rotation assassins have at their disposal. It has a 90 second cooldown. If an adc is getting caught more than every 90 seconds they *definitely* deserve to die.  Additionally ADCs are *by design* weak in isolation. Thats why the support role exists. Personally I think an adc alone should almost always die to an assassin. But if youre support is standing right there and doesnt use exhuast/Lulu polymorph/Soraka silence/Leona stun etc well then thats on your support.  &#x200B  Edit - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9H8a5cdq\_U

And before you @ me Riot literally confirmed this themselves in a Q&A.
rb6r4e,hnnrtbm,hnnrtbm,"If ADCs are going to be near useless when behind, assassins should be too.",Zerhap,12/07/2021,-1,My problem with this is an ADC has a better spot than an assassin for getting back into the game.  If you take a 1/5 adc and a 1/5 assassin with CD and make them fight sure the assassin will win but that is were they shine if i see my ADC fighting an assassin 1 v 1 i blame the ADC not the assassin.   oh but assassins can jump me (ADC) well thats on you ADC most important job is positioning if you dont know the most important part of your role no one can help you.  Now on the real situations you well encounter is  2 v 2 and up in those an assassin that is behind well do next to nothing just a little CC and he well get deleted just as easily as the ADC or run away meanwhile even a behind ADC can do some basics for safety.  Assassins when behind cant farm they can try but they better be ready to run since they have to move out of safety meanwhile ADCs can always farm from a tower be it in their lane or another yet most ADCs refuse to farm when behind and try to get  kills instead.  &#x200B  IMO ADCs are the one that refuse to adapt most ADCs can win by not dying and just farming but they keep trying to get kills and falling behind only to blame everyone else but themselves. And just in case i am not an assassin user i am a support and mostly use things like seraphine brand leona and galio with those first 2 i am a mid laner that is behind most of the match yet an assassin well have a hard time killing me even if i am build full support.
rb6r4e,hnnhrwo,hnnhrwo,"If ADCs are going to be near useless when behind, assassins should be too.",Albii557,12/07/2021,-1,I wanna play brainless against classes that are literally there to counter me when they are behind and if they somehow still are able to do what they are supposed to the class is to good when behind :)   I mostly play toplane Bruisers but assasins are one of the classes that are the most useless when behind. Even worse than bruisers. Why are adcs always so crybabies damn.
rb6r4e,hnn3154,hnn3154,"If ADCs are going to be near useless when behind, assassins should be too.",Nivelyx,12/07/2021,-2,What adc do you play? If you are vayne with shieldbow you can easily survive the assasins. Same with Tristana. Just stop first picking jinx or jhin ffs
rb6r4e,hnmp2pu,hnmp2pu,"If ADCs are going to be near useless when behind, assassins should be too.",Pretend_Yam6590,12/07/2021,-13,people are really complaining about adc when all 3 of the hyper carry adcs (vayne jinx and kogmaw) are all strong. loll

rb6r4e,hno4z9r,hno4z9r,"If ADCs are going to be near useless when behind, assassins should be too.",applecat144,12/07/2021,1,Whats funny is that ADCs are the most consistently not-weak-when-behind characters. Vayne may have 2 items when the rest of everyone has 4 shes still super dangerous and can still clutch the fight. Doesnt really work for stuff like Draven or Samira but most botlaners can hard carry leaving their lane in 1/5. So your whole point is moot.  Its normal that an assassin even behind can still be a threat to a squishy tho not to such an extent on that we agree. Yet ADCs arent meant to duel anything so when theyre opposed to something that excells at dueling squishies theyre expected to lose even if their opponent is behind.  Im saying all that as an ADC main.
rb6r4e,hno5xr0,hno5xr0,"If ADCs are going to be near useless when behind, assassins should be too.",Barb0ssaEUW,12/07/2021,1,The most disgusting thing is if you look at the last seasons you will clearly identify that most balance related affairs were about Mid Jungle and Top. You saw certain buffs here and there for Marksman champions or to balance new releases but overall mainly Mid Jungle and Top were funneled with insane buffs the best items and adjustments. Supports also received a lot but also have been punished with certain nerfs like XP gain. It incentivised Supports to rather roam and leave the disgusting a-D-C behind because he is useless for a long time (if he didnt snowball in the first 5-10 mins). You just feel like: Why should I play if the game mainly revolves around Mid Jungle and Top - and bot lane is support diff? And Riot is not addressing it at all ignoring it... the only related buff in the PreS video was LT and guess what lmao: It benefited mainly melees who abused it to the point where most Top and Mid laners are taking LT now which was fundamentally a ranged rune (with exceptions like Trynd). It is pathetic and just a miserable time.
rb6r4e,hno8a31,hno8a31,"If ADCs are going to be near useless when behind, assassins should be too.",UX1Z,12/07/2021,1,ADC has the same problem jungle has. It is too powerful of a role.     It has the additional problem of being something thats meant to be a scaling pick in a game that is often decided by 15 minutes.

Yones ult immediately stuns all enemies it hits and marks them. After a short delay it deals damage to all marked enemies in the same area pulls them and knocks them up. So you can avoid the second part by leaving the area in time you just need to get out of the stun somehow.

rb3snn,hnmm35m,hnmm35m,Yone R in a nutshell,Lake9009,12/07/2021,6,The hit box is bigger than the animation shows  Dawnbringer yone has a different animation for his ult and it is significantly bigger than the base one.
rb3snn,hnmmf94,hnmmf94,Yone R in a nutshell,TheLastMeower,12/07/2021,5,That’s a big fat clarity issue
rb3snn,hnnw4w1,hnnw4w1,Yone R in a nutshell,CheChocolateChap,12/07/2021,3,same happens for the long sides of the hitbox rip
rb3snn,hnmnn1z,hnmnn1z,Yone R in a nutshell,ApplePitou,12/07/2021,1,It seems the size of this ult is bigger after all :3
rb3snn,hnms5pa,hnms5pa,Yone R in a nutshell,milyziom,12/07/2021,1,hitboxes that are shown dont represent the actual hitbox. take leona for example youre like 5 meters away from it but it still hits you. also yone has this werid mechanic where he teleports behind his ultimate not at the end which indirectly increases its range.
rb3snn,hno5vo7,hno5vo7,Yone R in a nutshell,Sondeor,12/07/2021,1,LoL crying over this is a little bit funny sorry bro.  Hitbox problems are a fact did you see lux q and ult hitbox? Or morgana q? I can add any champion here if we have time :)  Yone ult is not even worth to mention it. Next time Dodge horizontal not vertical.

rb3snn,hnnhyya,hnnhyya,Yone R in a nutshell,Sausage_Trooper,12/07/2021,3,Whats the point of showing me the hitbox then?  Might as well just show the animation and call it a day. If an enemy ability shows a hitbox in the animation it should represent the actual full hitbox.
rb3snn,hnnhj7i,hnnhj7i,Yone R in a nutshell,Wakulinjo,12/07/2021,1,Thats the issue :/
rb3snn,hnni3r0,hnni3r0,Yone R in a nutshell,milyziom,12/07/2021,3,ping and server has a lot to it. cuz for someone it looks like it wouldnt hit but for some it would.
